      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not say that in the first place?  Does the Minister suggest it is possible to get tinned salmon cheaper in Japan than anywhere nearer us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, it is surely necessary for some member of the Government to give a credit for the buying of <Col N="185" /> tinned salmon and surely it ought to be a matter for Government consideration whether it is more economic to buy this tinned salmon in Japan or somewhere nearer home.</P>

      <P>I was most anxious that the contract for building an air sea rescue launch for service in the Shannon Estuary should be placed with an Irish firm, and I gave the matter very full consideration before reaching a decision.  The launch is, however, of a highly specialised kind and after full consideration of the advice tendered to me by my technical advisers I was regretfully forced to the conclusion that I had no choice but to place the order with a specialist outside firm.</P>

On the first occasion, it was inspected by a representative of a firm of naval architects with an official from my Department, and on the second occasion by officials of Irish Shipping Limited.

      <P>I am not, at present, prepared to make funds available out of the National Development Fund towards the cost of works designed to combat coast erosion, as enabling legislation would be required before satisfactory arrangements could be made for their initiation, financing, maintenance, etc. Proposals for such legislation are in course of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Wexford County Council had already submitted to some Department, whether the Minister's or the Department of Local Government, schemes dealing with erosion in North Wexford in the area of Courtown Harbour.  That would indicate that it was suggested by someone to the local authority that these funds should be made available for dealing with erosion.</P>

Unless at that stage I feel that in principle some payment should be made, I would have no grounds for inquiring into the <Col N="192" /> matters referred to in the second question, which are matters of internal administration in the hospital.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the coming into operation of Section 23 of the Health Act, 1953, on the 1st January, 1954, and the Maternity Cash Grant Regulations, 1953, made thereunder, a cash grant of <Col N="193" /> £4 in respect of each confinement is payable to a woman in the lower income group, i.e., broadly speaking, persons who are entitled to be attended free of charge by a dispensary doctor during illness.  The grant is payable irrespective of whether the woman is attended by any doctor during confinement. The woman must apply in writing for the grant within three months after her confinement to the appropriate local authority and produce evidence that the confinement took place.</P>
      <P>The grant is not payable to a woman who is maintained in an institution after confinement (otherwise than for the purpose of medical or surgical treatment) at the expense of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The maternity cash grant is distinct from, and additional to, any maternity benefit to which an insured woman or wife of an insured man may be entitled under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is desirable that eligible persons should have the means of knowing the services available to them and how they should set about availing of them, and I am considering how best that could be achieved.  I feel, however, that until more progress has been made in regard to the precise manner of the implementation of the various services envisaged in the Act, the issue of a booklet would be premature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware of the congested conditions on Clare Island, County Mayo; and, if so, if he will request the Land Commission to take the necessary steps to ease the congestion there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The 76 holdings comprised in the Clare Island estate were rearranged by the (late) Congested Districts Board in 1901 and there are no current proposals for further rearrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I presume, is aware of the thinning out of the population in Clare Island due to the fact that their holdings are absolutely inadequate.  While I do not disagree with what the Minister has said about the settlement by the Congested Districts Board in 1901, that settlement is now of very little value for the reason that conditions have changed. I would ask the Minister to consider directing the Land Commission to increase the size of the holdings there; otherwise, the island will be completely derelict in another 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think historically the Deputy's suggestion is correct because in the sixth report of the Congested Districts Board, published in 1897, it was stated that: &ldquo;In practically every instance the islanders are satisfied with the settlement that has been made, though a few are naturally disappointed that their former habit of putting more than their fair share of cattle on the commonage grazing will, in the interests of the tenants, be permitted no longer.&rdquo;  The final report of the Royal Commission on Congestion in Ireland, published in 1908, favourably commented on the work that had been done and expressed the view that a very good scheme had been put into operation.  In any event, to take these people away from Clare Island would mean that land would have to be provided for them on the mainland and <Col N="201" /> there is no land available for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that serious congestion exists in the townlands of Carrownteeaun and Altbaun (Leonard Stronge estate), County Mayo; that the majority of the holdings in these two townlands are about £5 P.L.V., and that the Land Commission has intimated that it is not proposed to take any action in regard to this congestion; and, if so, if he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to have these and similarly situated areas even though vested brought up to economic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The holdings in Carrownteeaun and many of the holdings in Altbaun were enlarged as far as practicable before being vested in the <Col N="202" /> tenant purchasers.  Proposals for the enlargement of the remaining unvested holdings in Altbaun will be prepared in due course but otherwise there is no immediate prospect of any lands becoming available for distribution in the area.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to introduce new legislation for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.  The Land Commission are making serious efforts to relieve congestion and effect rearrangement on those estates which still remain unsold and I do not feel that they should interrupt this work to reexamine cases which have already been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Land Commission should give up the work of rearranging the estates that remain unsold at the present day. My question is whether the Minister stands over a system that has grown up in the Land Commission whereby, once a particular townland or estate was vested in the tenants&mdash;no matter what the valuations or the size of the holdings were&mdash;the estate was considered settled finally, once and for all.  This is the third reply which I have received from the Minister to-day which indicates that the Land Commission are definitely seeking to shelve their responsibility.  I ask the Minister not to stand over that type of thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff of the Land Commission can only deal with a certain number of holdings.  The Deputy <Col N="203" /> seems to suggest that the holdings that have not been dealt with&mdash;the tenants of which have received no improvement as a result of Land Commission operations&mdash;should now be put aside and that the work which, after careful consideration, has been undertaken should be deferred to deal with isolated cases.  I do not suggest that all the cases have not merits and if there were sufficient land and sufficient staff to deal with them, I suppose they could all be dealt with eventually.  I see no possibility of dealing with more than a fraction of the cases that have not already been touched to the satisfaction of any reasonable person.  Why, then, should we set aside our programme to take up these cases?  The Carrownteeaun case, for example, was dealt with as far back as 1902 or 1904 by the Congested Districts Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the provision for supplementary grants under Section 7 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, Section 21 (3) of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952 authorises the Minister in the event of an appeal from a person aggrieved by the refusal or failure of a housing authority to make a supplementary grant or by the amount of a supplementary grant, to direct the authority to make any grant which the Minister thinks just and which could have been made by the authority under Section 7 of the Act of 1950.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from that that in cases where the local authority pays the grant, minus a certain sum in respect of a bathroom and sanitary accommodation, the Minister can in all cases make the remainder of the grant available or give a direction to the local authority to give the remaining portion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the Deputy has in mind but I think I know.  The Housing Act, 1952, provides that a State grant will be made in respect of the erection of a new house, say, for a five-room house of £225 non-serviced.  If the application is made through a public utility society it will amount to £235.  If the house is a serviced house it will amount to £275 or, in the case of an application through a public utility society, £285.  Section 7 of the 1950 Act was a permissive section and enabled the local authority, where it adopted a scheme under that section, to pay supplemental grants.  The scheme decided upon by any particular local body was submitted to my Department at the time and sanctioned. <Col N="210" /> If the scheme decided upon by the local authority was a £1 for £1 grant to the applicant, as it was in Mayo, naturally the local authority would not in justice be entitled to refuse a grant to a man for a fully serviced house and pay him instead a grant for a non-serviced house.</P>

      <P>The following districts are listed for examination in 1954: Tuam, Bandon, Skibbereen, Killarney, Tralee, Castle-rea and the remainder of Sligo.  When this programme is completed, the order of priority for the remaining areas will be decided.  I cannot indicate when the reorganisation of the remainder of County Waterford will be undertaken or when the reorganisation scheme is likely to be completed in all areas.

This is the same as that payable to road workers employed by the Cork County Council.  It is on a par with the rates paid by county councils throughout the State for road work.

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that the prices received by our producers for eggs since the beginning of the year have not been satisfactory.  There has been a considerable improvement, however, in the prices obtained in the past few weeks, and, in addition, good prices continue to be available for poultry.</P>
      <P>The market for our eggs in Britain is now completely free and egg producers in this country must be prepared to accept competitive prices.  I cannot forecast what the future prices for eggs will be, but I want to emphasise that the British market is now highly competitive as a result of increased home production of eggs and that it is essential that the costs of producing and marketing our eggs must be brought down so that we can compete as regards price on that market.  I am convinced that poultry-keepers can effect considerable economies by feeding more homegrown food to their poultry, by keeping better quality laying birds and by adopting up-to-date methods of egg production.  They can also help themselves and the general poultry position by marketing their eggs in good condition and clean in shell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  The decision to terminate the activities of Eggsports followed a demand from poultry-keepers, county committees of agriculture and traders engaged in the egg and poultry business to wind up the company, and to return the trade to private hands.  I would also refer the Deputy to Volume 142, No. 1, of the Dáil Debates of 20th October, 1953, page 93, of the debate on the Estimates for my Department.</P>

      <P>(1)  As far as eggs are concerned, Eggsports Limited, in liquidation, were still dealing with the export of eggs up to the 31st December, 1953, and the export prices up to that date were those authorised by me.  In December, owing to the glut of eggs on the British market, and increased production in this country, I was forced to reduce the price to 2/4 per dozen from 3/4 per dozen.  Since the 1st January, the export of eggs reverted to private hands, but there has, in fact, been only a negligible export of eggs since that date, and the price was, therefore, determined by supply and demand on the home market.  With regard to poultry, that trade reverted to private hands on the 1st October, 1953, and the prices obtained by exporters on the British market and paid to producers here showed an appreciable improvement over those which, up to that date, were being obtained by Eggsports Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>

The decision to wind up this company was discussed with the directors of Eggsports, Limited, on 21st August, 1953, and the staff of the company were informed immediately after that meeting that it would be necessary for them to begin to seek other employment. When the liquidator took over on the 7th October, in accordance with the rules of liquidation, he informed the staff that their employment would be continued on a day to day basis.  In fact, however, at least half the staff immediately took employment with the new export organisation which had been formed and others who had not obtained alternative employment continued to be employed by the liquidator up to the end of December. Under the terms of their contract of employment, the former employees of Eggsports, Limited, have no claim to compensation, but I am at present considering the possibility of making an ex gratia payment to those who have been disemployed.</P>

The prices paid to producers for pigs have fallen only by a relatively small amount during the past two months and the prices of pig feed have also decreased in recent weeks.  Reductions in the prices for exports of pigmeat to Britain have necessarily followed, under the Pigs and Bacon Agreement with the Ministry of Food, reductions made in the prices for British home-produced pigs.</P>

      <P>The moneys received by the Pigs and Bacon Commission from the British Ministry of Food under the Pigs and Bacon Agreement with Britain cover exports of both pork and bacon.

The average price thus received was £19 14s. 9d. per pig.  The total moneys received by the Pigs and Bacon Commission in respect of these exports have been paid to the exporters of pork and bacon as above.</P>
      <P>The activities of the Pigs and Bacon Commission comprise the carrying out of the functions assigned to it under the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1940 (subject to certain modifications still operative under emergency powers Orders) and under the Bacon, Live Pigs and Pork Carcases (Export to Minister of Food) Order, 1952.

No cause for uneasiness in that respect can, therefore, be said to exist.  The Pigs and Bacón Agreement with Britain provides pig producers with an assured outlet for pigs in excess of home market requirements at prices related to the prices paid for British home-produced pigs.</P>

      <P>What is the difficulty in regard to not having information on the items referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary?  The first question I asked was: (a) the quantity in tons of imported superphosphate transferred from the different stores throughout the country to the fertilising factories for reconditioning.  What is the difficulty in finding that information? Under (b) I asked for the amount paid per ton by the fertilising factories for the superphosphate so dealt with, and (c) the amount paid for transport for removing it from the stores to the fertilising factories.  It had been in the stores for three years, and we paid £90,000 for its storage during those three years.</P>

      <P>I have arranged to make an Order at an early date prescribing as from 5th April, 1954, minimum meshes of seine and trawl nets. This Order is being made in fulfilment of our obligations under an international convention which, as regards nets, will operate from the date mentioned. The original date for the introduction of the mesh sizes stipulated in the convention was 5th April, 1953, but a postponement of 12 months was agreed upon by the contracting Governments, so that fishermen would have adequate time to make the necessary changes in their gear.  After the postponement had been arranged, a revision of the measurements laid down in the convention was suggested by some of the countries concerned.  Such a revision had to be considered by the permanent commission established to supervise the working of the convention, and it was not until a recent date that the procedure necessary for the adoption of these amendments was completed.  I regret that it is not now possible to give the fishermen longer notice of the minimum sizes of meshes to be used as from 5th April next.</P>

      <P>The Minister moved this amendment yesterday to include in the places that may be billeted restaurants, and that fits in to some extent with the hotels and licensed premises that are in the section already.  The Minister in support of this amendment indicated that I had said in the Special Committee that this might be extended to include board and lodging houses, milk bars, public dance halls, communal halls, halls owned by local authorities, cafes and refreshment rooms.  The Minister seemed to have some doubt as to the terms &ldquo;communal halls&rdquo; and &ldquo;halls owned by local authorities&rdquo; and said that if I had used the expression &ldquo;parish hall&rdquo; he would have understood it.  My general objection, as I said yesterday, was in regard to this billeting provision at all, and if the Minister wants to extend it to include those restaurants in addition to the hotels and premises licensed to sell intoxicating drink it is an extension which would appear, on the face of it, to give very little extra accommodation. I wonder if the Minister knows how many premises in the different towns in Ireland are registered under that section of the Health Act of 1947. It is just an interesting point in connection with the approach to the section as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the convenience of the House, I will deal with the two. The additional amendment which the Ceann Comhairle suggests we should discuss now applies to members of the Reserve as distinct from officers of the Reserve.  Seventy-four deals with reservists who become members of either House of the Oireachtas, and the particular amendment I am now dealing with deals with an officer who relinquishes his commission.  I have never been able to ascertain why we should have a provision such as this in our Acts.  For quite a considerable period under the old Act of 1923 and when the Reserve was established, officers of the Reserve of Officers were entitled to be members of this House and, in fact, were members of this House.  I personally look upon service in the Reserve of Officers as the very highest service that a person can render to the country, and if, in addition to that, a person who is a first class officer of the Reserve of Officers is honoured by the people in his own locality by being sent forward as a Deputy of the Dáil I can see no reason why he should have to resign his commission in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that during the last war when Britain was engaged in a life and death struggle, with her <Col N="240" /> armies scattered all over the world fighting in different hemispheres, the personnel of those armies were entitled to be and, in fact, were members of the British Parliament.  I see no reason why because an excellent young officer on the Reserve of the Defence Forces becomes a member of this House, he should thereupon be obliged to resign his commission.</P>
    <P>Many people will approach this from different viewpoints.  Some may hold that it is desirable that the element of politics should be excluded from the Reserve of Officers.  But that is not so in practice because members of the Reserve are entitled to belong to any particular Party they wish and they are entitled to actively participate in politics.  Until this Bill becomes law, if it does become law, they are entitled to be members of local authorities performing public duties and rendering public service.  I fear that a narrowminded conception of either Parliament or the Reserve is responsible for this particular approach.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say in what way membership of the Dáil or the Seanad interferes with the efficiency of an officer of the Reserve Defence Forces.  In what way does it detract from his ability to serve the State as an officer of the Reserve? Unless there is some very sound and valid reason for the insertion of this particular amendment in the Bill I do not think we ought to permit it to be inserted.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, his predecessors and many Deputies have from time to time adverted to the high service that can be rendered to the State by a young man who becomes a reservist and who, because of his ability and efficiency, is promoted to commissioned rank.  If such a man is honoured by those amongst whom he lives by being selected as a candidate for this House I see no reason why he should thereupon be compelled or obliged to relinquish his commission in the Defence Forces.  The relinquishment of such a commission is something that a keen reserve officer would resent.  Yet, here we say to him in effect: &ldquo;If your friends in your own area select you as <Col N="241" /> a candidate and if you are elected by the people to represent them in the Dáil, or if you are appointed a Senator, you must relinquish your commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taken in association with the matters to which I have already drawn attention, this particular provision demonstrates a conception both of Parliament and of the Defence Forces which is not the correct one.  We pride ourselves that we serve the State at what we consider to be the very highest levels. It has always been admitted that a person who serves in the Defence Forces of his country renders very honourable service to his country.  Why should he be forced or obliged to retire from the Army if he becomes a member of the Dáil or Seanad?  The Minister could by regulation, if he so desires, provide that an officer or a reservist appointed to either the Dáil or Seanad can be placed on an inactive list for the period during which he is a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why he should be placed in the position in which the honourable commission received by him from the President of his country can be taken away from him by force.  I know quite a number of arguments can be invented to support a practice that grew up without proper or adequate consideration. Although this is not the most important section of this Bill it is nevertheless important in the context in which I deal with it.  I would strongly urge the Minister to delete this unnecessary sub-section.  The Minister will agree that he has grave difficulty in bringing the Defence Forces up to strength.  He has grave difficulty in bringing the Reserve up to strength.  The mentality behind this section in relation to the Reserve shows that the high appreciation of the honourable service given which should be held is not in fact held by the persons who have drafted this particular sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to labour this point, because the net issue is a very simple one.  I confess I felt a tremendous personal chagrin when I was forced because of my election to this House to sever my association with <Col N="242" /> the Army.  I do not press the Minister in the way that Deputy Cowan presses him.  The answer to this difficulty is to find a formula whereby, should a member of the Reserve of Officers be elected to this House, his commission will be left in abeyance while he is serving in this House to be restored to him again once he ceases to be a member of this House.  I do not know that there is any real merit in not permitting such a situation to develop.  I can see many arguments against active participation in the Reserve or in the Army by members of this House.  I am quite prepared to admit that the question of dual responsibility would immediately enter into the situation then.  A man might be torn between his legislative duty and his affections for his Army colleagues in certain decisions that might be pertinent to the Army, but I feel that if the Minister could evolve a formula whereby we would not be forced to renege our Army connection by virtue of election he would have gone as far as I would press him to go in relation to this section.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this House is in any way unconscious of the service that officers give to the State, or that we would in any way like to take from the appreciation we must of necessity show to people who have attained to the commissioned ranks, whether in the regular Army or in the Reserve.  I do feel, however, that we have grown sufficiently as a nation to arrive at a reasonable formula whereby, as referred to by Deputy Cowan, people who acquire the added distinction of becoming elected representatives of the people in Dáil Éireann should not by that fact be penalised, as penalty it is, to the extent of having to relinquish the commission that they got honourably and held honourably. Why should the circumstance of a greater trust by their people in them necessitate the relinquishing of that commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the basis af all this argument is the root trouble that the Minister must recognise before the Bill goes much further, that we are inclined to cull our Bill from sections of the Articles of War or from the manual of the Canadian Army or from various <Col N="243" /> manuals at the disposal of the Department rather than address our minds to the pertinent problem of our own people.  If we did that, and if people in the Department of Defence were conscious in any way of the <i>esprit de corps</i> and the pride of an officer by virtue of having been commissioned, there would not be need for this type of argument. I think this is something that is basic to a greater issue than is conceived within the words of the section.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound unreasonable, but I think if we are drafting a permanent Defence Force Bill, and if we are, in the Minister's own words, trying to envisage every possibility, it is a tragic if not a shameful travesty of our intelligence to suggest that we cannot find a reasonable solution whereby further distinctions gained by a citizen of this State, such as elevation to membership of the Oireachtas, should not necessitate the penal infliction of having to relinquish his commission.  If the situation presented itself to-morrow that we were called into the breach again in a strife for national existence, I know that many of my young colleagues here, as well as myself, who served in the Army might be more prone to relinquish their membership of the Oireachtas and go back to what they might consider in those circumstances their first duty.  We should not be denied that facility if such an issue were to be presented to us.</P>
    <P>There is something inherently wrong if we cannot conceive a simple formula whereby those Reserve officers will not have to do anything more drastic than possibly to go into an inactive or inoperative list, or whatever type of list you like to call it, while serving in the Dáil, leaving them available, if the occasion should arise, to go back to the Army for further service, thus, at least, ensuring the continuance of something that the individual, by virtue of having won it, may pride himself on having obtained.  That is true of practically every member of this House who had the honour to serve in the ranks of the emergency Army and of many who served in more turbulent and more dangerous times.</P>
    <P>Most of us attained these commissions <Col N="244" /> from the ranks and they were to all of us a cherished possession.  I am talking personally when I say that I felt it a very bitter pill to swallow when, by virtue of the fact that the people of West Cork, not a bit backward in their own military tradition, sent me into this House to represent them, I had to cease to be a member of the Reserve of Officers.  I think there is something wrong in that and that the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept the amendment in the way it is now presented, might try to evolve a formula whereby at least a person elected to this House would have the option of going on some type of inoperative list on the Reserve rather than having to relinquish his commission. I do not believe they were in any way resigned; I think the axe had to fall on them by virtue of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of these questions which we discussed at very great length in the Special Committee. On that occasion I made it very clear to the members of that committee that I was very strongly in favour of the Bill as it stood.  In fact, I intimated very clearly that I was not prepared in any circumstances to accept the amendment to the particular section.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment which Deputy Cowan has put down, to delete the words that are referred to in sub-section (6) and these are the reasons which I can give.  The first reason is that successive Governments have apparently felt as I do that it is highly <Col N="245" /> undesirable that we should have in the Army members of the Oireachtas, members of either the Seanad, or of this House, while at the same time they are members of the Army.  I can see no difficulty, if the opportunity should arise for a member of this House who is eligible to become a member of the Army, joining the Army if he is acceptable, and resigning from this House.  The only difficulty that appears to exist would appear to be the question of his having to resign his position in this House.  I remember in the course of discussions in the Special Committee saying that it was quite impossible for us to sit or attempt to sit between two stools.  We are bound if we make that effort to come to disaster.  On that point alone I think this House would be well advised not to consider this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is quite impossible&mdash;we all know that&mdash;and it would be practically impossible in a period of emergency for a member of this House to give service to this House of the type which he would be expected to give and at the same time give service to the Army of the type which the Army would demand.  How we are going to reconcile these facts I do not know.  My own strong conviction is that, apart from these facts at all, whatever may be the custom in other armies or other nations, we anyhow, who are building up our own laws and customs, ought at this stage make certain that the Army will be a non-political army and that there will be nothing in the nature of politics brought into it openly. Members can have their own political viewpoints.  That has never been denied to any member of the Army and as far as members of the Reserve of the Army are concerned, if any member decides to stand for election in any election, municipal or parliamentary, he is fully entitled to do so and is not prevented from standing for election.  What is demanded from him is that if he succeeds in being elected to the parliamentary institution he will resign.  That is all we ask, that he will not go into the Army or operate in the Army as what might be described as an active politician.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any remedy beyond the simple remedy of going for the Army wholly or remaining in the House as a full-time Deputy.  I honestly believe there is no in-between method.  We have got to stand clear on one aspect or the other. We either have to give our full service to this House to which we were elected by the people or go and give full-time service to the Army, and if an individual desires to do that it would apparently be his choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Cannot the Minister see the point of view that there is an infliction on the man, that he must relinquish his commission?  A member of the Reserve would not have to give his whole time to the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is as I have described and it is the position I am endeavouring to sustain.  To some extent we are discussing this question in a hypothetical atmosphere. First of all, I do not think at the present time that any member of this House would be eligible to become a member of the Army from the point of view of age.  I am not going to suggest that in an emergency we could not call on Captain Cowan, Major de Valera and Deputy McQuillan and on any other ex-Army Deputies in the House if we thought it desirable that their services would be of value to the nation but it would then become the choice of these Deputies to say whether they were prepared to relinquish their parliamentary duties to give full-time service to the Army, or give full-time service to the House and forgo their right to be members of the Army. That is the simple position as I see it and that it the simple position that I am appealing to this House and to Captain Cowan and Deputy Collins who are advocating this amendment not to go ahead with it, to retain the position that has been so successful right from the beginning.  Deputies of the House can ask themselves: Has the Army suffered as a result of this <Col N="247" /> regulation being in force through all these years?  Or has the House suffered through not having the service of some Army officers who might have a desire to become members of this House?  I do not think either House has suffered in the least, nor do I think they will suffer in the future.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of the Reserve of Officers is concerned it is clear that it does not arise as a result of this amendment.  If there are any Reserve officers outside who desire to stand for election to this House there is nothing to prevent them from becoming a candidate for any political Party prepared to select them.  The only thing that will follow as a result of their success in that election is that they must then tender their resignations and that is the principle I am fighting on this particular amendment.  I am fighting to retain the position as it exists at the present time because I believe strongly it is not only in the best interests of the Army but that it is also in the best interests of the House and of the nation.</P>
      <P>From that point of view alone I would strongly appeal to Deputy Cowan not to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to meet the Minister's wishes if I possibly could but the reason I do not accept them is because I can see the fallacy of the case that is made for the retention of this sub-section.  The sub-section does not say that an officer of the Reserve who becomes a member of the Dáil may resign.  It simply says he relinquishes his commission and that is the end of it.  Out he goes on top of his head the moment he is elected to the Dáil.  I feel that that is not right.  I feel it is a reflection either on the Dáil or on the Defence Forces.  It seems to me to be a serious reflection on the Defence Forces.  I made the case that service in the Defence Forces is honourable service and that service in the Reserve is very honourable service. We want to have all the young men of the country join the Reserve Forces and by their ability become commissioned officers in it.  If they reach <Col N="248" /> that honourable position there is no reason why they should be turfed out of the Reserve because that is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>The Army is clear of politics.  When a person is in the Regular Army he cannot belong to any political organisation but he can indicate his political views and he does indicate them.  I am glad to say that service in the Regular Army has never prevented a man from expressing his political views.  I think that nowhere else does one hear political views expressed so clearly from time to time on current events as in the Regular Army.  That does not interfere in any way with the discipline and the spirit of comradeship that exist in the Army.</P>
      <P>Take the Reserve which comes up for training once a year for a few days in peacetime.  How can that affect a person who happens to be a member of the Oireachtas?  I am sorry to say that this was introduced into the Bill in my view because the matter was not seriously enough considered by the person who drafted that particular sub-section. I know it is not the Minister's baby.  That particular sub-section was in the Bill introduced by his predecessor. Perhaps, if we had had the opportunity of discussing the Bill in those days the Minister might have been on our side in regard to this particular sub-section but it is the conception that forces an officer to resign because he becomes a member of the Dáil to which I object.</P>
      <P>I did mention the British Parliament and the fact that you see officers, certainly during the war, in uniform participating in debates affecting the future of their country.  The fact that a man serves in the Defence Forces should not take away his sense of responsibility to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should add to it but I am dealing with it in a negative way that it should not take away his sense of responsibility.  Any person who is able to become an officer in the Reserve and is selected to be a member of this House or of the Seanad ought <Col N="249" /> to be, in my view, in the highest category of citizen.  If he is in the highest category of citizen, then it should not be necessary to have a particular section such as this which says that on being made a member of the Dáil he will be forced out of the Defence Forces and have to give up his commission.</P>
      <P>There is the idea that the Dáil is full-time service.  That is expressed by the Minister.  Of course, it is not full-time service.  It was never intended to be full-time service for any member of the Dáil.  It is full-time service for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, but as far as any other member of the Dáil is concerned, membership of the Dáil is purely and simply a part-time occupation.  That is in theory.  In respect of that he receives certain allowances for losing time in his own occupation.  The trouble is, of course, that an effort is being made to make it full-time employment but if we stick to principle it is not full-time employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they do. Nevertheless, the conception is that each and every one of us, with the exception of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, for whom it is full time, have occupations of our own and we attend sittings of the Dáil.  We assist the Dáil in deliberating on legislation and matters of importance that come before it.  If we keep to the theoretical aspect of the matter we see there is no reason in the world why a person cannot have the two part-time occupations&mdash;occupation as a member of the Dáil or Seanad and occupation as a member of the Reserve or Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I have, with the assistance of Deputy Collins, fought that issue.  We cannot beat the Minister on it.  All we can do is to leave our words on record against that.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 35 to delete Section 49 (2), lines 31 and 32, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> (2)  The President shall with all convenient speed accept the resignation of his commission tendered by an officer.</P>
    <P>This amendment follows the very same trend of principle.  It is a matter on which I feel a considerable amount of concern.  It is a provision which was introduced into the Defence Force legislation during the emergency or immediately prior to it and which gave the President the right to say to an officer who tendered his resignation: &ldquo;No, sir, I refuse to accept your resignation. You must stay on and serve on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not in the original Defence Force legislation.  It went through this House without any consideration by the House.  Like this present Bill, apparently the members of the Dáil, with a few exceptions, were not interested in it.  It slipped through in that way.  I want to say that it seems to me to be wrong constitutionally and it is certainly wrong from many other points of view.  When an officer is commissioned, he is commissioned in the Defence Forces by the President, who appoints him to be an officer in the Defence Forces.  His position is different from the case of the soldier who enters into a contract to serve the State for a specified period in his document of attestation or enlistment.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to realise the difference and to realise especially that, when a soldier joins the Army, he enters into a contract with the State to serve in the Army for a particular period.  There are provisions whereby, on the expiration of that period, the Army has no further control over him. There are special matters in regard to a period of emergency or war when the period ends, and there are provisions in the law relating to the soldier who wants to get out of his contract.  He can get out in certain ways.  He has the right to obtain his discharge by purchase at a prescribed fee and on tendering that he is discharged.  The relationship between the soldier and the Army is, therefore, contractual, with rights on both sides&mdash;the right of the Army to say: &ldquo;You stay here until the period for which you contracted to serve has expired or until you satisfy <Col N="251" /> one of these other provisions laid down in your contract whereby you could get out earlier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position of an officer is different. He does not enter into a contract for a fixed or specific period.  Because of his good conduct and because of the confidence which the President wishes to repose in him, the President gives to him a commission in the rank, generally, of second lieutenant, from which he may be promoted in accordance with regulations. The commission is given to him as a commission in the Defence Forces, and until this amendment, to which I referred, about giving the President the right to refuse a resignation, was put in, an officer could at any time tender his resignation and that resignation must be dealt with with all convenient speed.</P>
    <P>The advisers of the Minister in the Department of Defence felt that this high honour and the high traditions associated with a military commission must be interfered with by them.  There is the history of commissioned service in all countries in the world to be considered, but it took our Department of Defence to consider that they should, in this new Bill and the one during the emergency to which I referred, introduce this provision that although an officer wanted to go they would keep him in if they thought fit.</P>
    <P>I have given some study to this matter.  There are very few places that a man in this country can be kept against his will.  If a man joins the Church, enters an order, he can leave it.  There are two places he cannot leave: he cannot leave prison or, unless the President so decides, leave commissioned rank in the Defence Forces.  I do not like to put it in that crude fashion, but when the mentality behind this amendment is so crude&mdash;when I say amendment, I mean the amendment of the original Defence Forces Act which inserted that clause in order to compel an officer to be kept in the Defence Forces against his will&mdash;then one has to talk pretty straight about it.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that that same clause was in the Bill that was introduced here by his predecessor, and he has now to carry the responsibility <Col N="252" /> in regard to it.  An officer must have the right to tender the resignation of his commission and to leave.  What kind of army would it be if an officer were compelled to remain in the Army against his will?  I do not think we understand that type of compulsion outside the minds of the Minister's advisers.</P>
    <P>I never knew of a man being refused the resignation of his commission when he tendered it except in one case.  That was the case of a young officer of the Air Corps who tendered the resignation of his commission and whose resignation was refused under that particular clause.  That young man had been promised employment in civilian life for which he would have been more highly paid, although it was in the same technical field, than he was being paid in the Defence Forces.  The case was made that the Defence Forces had spent some time and money in training him and, therefore, they refused to accept his resignation.  Against his will, he was compelled to remain in the Army and to continue his flying with the Air Corps.  A very short time afterwards that young man, the only son of his parents, was involved in an accident and was killed.  That happened only recently.</P>
    <P>What is the good of putting such a clause into an Act and then enforcing it against one individual with that result?  I feel very keenly about that whole matter.  I felt at the time that that was an unconstitutional and illegal provision in the Act, that it could not be supported if the matter were tested in our courts and I feel some little sense of responsibility that all the avenues that were open to me in regard to it were not explored.</P>
    <P>Why should a provision like that be put in our Act, that a person who voluntarily accepts a commission from the President cannot say to the President: &ldquo;I desire to relinquish that commission.&rdquo;&ldquo;I desire to leave the Army.&rdquo;&ldquo;I desire to enter into another field of activity.&rdquo;  If there is any ground for it I would like to hear the Minister explain it and if there is no ground for it let it go out of the Act. The Army cannot be on the basis that it is a penal settlement where a person <Col N="253" /> is obliged to serve when he accepts a commission until he reaches a retiring age, that if he does not want to continue to serve in the Defence Forces, he can be obliged to serve in them for the term of life as applied to our felons in Portlaoighise prison.  We must take the broader point of view, not the petty or footling finance provisions, that because a few pounds were spent on the training of this man he must be retained.  He will be kept in if it is found out that he is going to better himself by leaving.  If, right through this Bill, there was not that petty mentality I am referring to, the discussion of this Bill would take very little time in this House.  However, every opportunity has been availed of to project and insert into it all these little petty pin-pricking provisions.  As I said at an earlier stage, it will be much better for the members of the Defence Forces if this Bill in its present form never passes this House.  There is a measure of protection in the old Act in regard to the pay of officers and soldiers which has been deliberately taken away in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I come to that, I will again have to point out the mentality and the concept and the idea that is behind the whole thing.  No good purpose is served by a provision of that nature.  I should like the Minister to say how many officers, since the State was established, have been refused permission to retire&mdash;how many officers other than the unfortunate young officer of whom I made mention a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>We have read recently in the papers that certain officers who have done great honour to this country at home and abroad by their competence and efficiency and horsemanship, have resigned from the Defence Forces.  I take it that in those cases, the Minister did not refuse to accept the tender of their resignation and that perhaps he realised, as every Deputy must realise, that when you take the line of refusing to accept the resignation of an officer you are setting up a form of compulsion which is entirely foreign to our concepts of democracy.  No person can be retained in any profession if he does not want to remain in it.  If a lawyer wants to give up the law, he is entitled to retire.</P>

      <P>A judge may retire. Anybody may retire.  I mentioned that a clergyman may retire.  A person may leave an order.  A nun may retire or resign from a convent.  A soldier may retire by paying a sum of money but, under this sub-section, an officer can be compelled to remain there against his will.  The only point that is to be put against it is the point that the Army may have spent money in training the officers and that, therefore, they are entitled to get all they can out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one idea behind military service is the fact that it is given voluntarily, that it is given with a spirit of patriotism, that there are no hours. An officer does not look for his eighthour day nor for his trade union week. <Col N="255" /> An officer who accepts the responsibility of holding a commission is available at all times, when he holds that commission, to render service to the State.  The criterion of his commission is service to the State at all times and, while he holds the commission, he is expected to render that service.  But when he wants to retire, to give up that commission, he must be entitled to do so.  In the teaching profession they have some clause whereby, if a person who was a pupil at one of the training schools gives up teaching or retires from it within a certain number of years of being appointed, he must refund portion of the moneys expended on him.  Some principle like that applies in a few other professions.</P>
    <P>In dealing with officers, we are dealing with men who are prepared to accept all the difficulties and responsibilities of the military career and to place their lives unreservedly at the disposal of the Government and at the disposal of the State.  When we are talking about officers we are talking about people in a much higher category than any of the other people, from the point of view of service to the State, that I might mention in the course of this debate.  It is that outlook and attitude of mind that should permeate this Bill&mdash;but, instead, we have the mean and miserable approach that I have mentioned.  I ask the Minister, now that this matter has been brought to his notice in the blunt way I have felt it necessary to bring it to his notice, to agree to remove this compulsory clause from the section and to allow an officer, who accepts the responsibility of commissioned rank voluntarily, the right to give up that commission voluntarily whenever he likes to do so.  There is very little likelihood that the State could suffer from that in any way.  It has been my experience that when the State is threatened by dangers no person will wish to leave it&mdash;and the person who would wish to leave it then is better rid of: such a person will be of no value to the State in that crisis or in that emergency.  For these reasons, I ask the House to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Cowan realises the exaggerated form in which he put forward his arguments for this amendment.  He implied that no officer in the Army who tendered his resignation would have the resignation accepted.  He tried to create the impression that that was the position. He asked the Minister to say how many have been refused.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many have been accepted.  It would be grossly unwise not to include a clause such as is in this section.  A grave offence could be committed by an officer and he could escape the military consequences if Deputy Cowan's amendment were accepted; he would merely have to tender his resignation immediately and it would have to be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Deputy Cowan referred to a young air force officer who wished to get into a better position and who was refused permission to resign and who was subsequently killed in an air accident.  He almost implied that it was because his resignation was refused that he died. If that officer had entered another air force, a civil air force, with better conditions, he might have been killed in an air accident also.  There was exaggeration in arguing that case.</P>
    <P>There is also the question as to whether the Army is to be used as a training school for young men, where they can be paid, and as soon as the opportunity offers to better themselves that they must be allowed to avail of it irrespective of the consequences to the Army.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in the argument put forward by Deputy Cowan that an officer should have the right to resign, but I do not think that it can be argued that he has a right to resign at any particular moment that he chooses without the State having some say in the matter.  I would be opposed to the amendment put forward by Deputy Cowan.  Some such clause as is in this section is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>We are beating about the bush.

      <P>We have experience of what the Minister's reactions are to various cases.  We are up against the difficulty that it is not the Minister we are trying to persuade in relation to this Bill.  It never has been.  That is the irksome reality in the background of this Bill.  It is presented to the Minister by the Department with plausible arguments and the Minister has an erroneous sense of duty for the protection of these sections.</P>
      <P>I shall not take any exaggerated view of the consequences that may flow from the refusal of the President to accept an officer's resignation.  There is nothing that we should desire less in an Army than an officer who is retained in it against his will.  If the Minister is afraid that this might open the door to too free resignation from highly technical branches of the service and if he wants protection in that matter, I feel that if a formula is found for that between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad he will get cooperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with Deputy Cowan in the basic principle involved, that when a man voluntarily accepts a commission in the Army from the President of this State he should be left in <Col N="259" /> the position that he can voluntarily relinquish it.</P>
    <P>It is the inconsistency of this whole Bill that is beginning to get me a little rattled.  The Minister, on a previous section, guillotined all members of the House who may have been officers of the Reserve.  Now, when we argue, rationally, that there should not be discretionary powers for the purpose of retaining officers who want to resign we get a different standpoint.</P>
    <P>The argument made by Deputy Colley was made in good faith but it was made in error.  For any act that a commissioned member of the Defence Forces committed prior to his resignation from the Defence Force he is answerable as if he were still serving in the Defence Force when he is ultimately arraigned and he may be a considerable period out of the Army when he may have to go back to answer a field general court-martial for matters that arose during his period of service.</P>

      <P>In many cases persons subject to the Defence Force Regulations would prefer to be answerable to a court-martial than to the civil law.  That is not a basic argument on which one can build a case to establish the necessity for this section.  I do not want to delay the Bill.  I do not want verbiage to cloud issues. There should be a right of an officer to get out if he wants to get out.  It is in the interest of the morale of the Army that he should be allowed to go. I do not know anyone more disgruntled than the people I had to meet at the end of the emergency when, for various reasons, indefinite leave or transfer to the Reserve was being slowed down.  If one has served in the Defence Force one can appreciate the effect on the morale of a corps, a battalion or mess of the disgruntled type of officer who <Col N="260" /> is carrying a chip on his shoulder and feels that he should be out.  I do not think that the Minister or his Department wants that kind of situation.  If an officer is retained against his will everything he does is against his will. I agree with Deputy Colley that possibly the reference that has been made by Deputy Cowan to a specific officer whose resignation was not accepted is pushing the case too far. It is extraordinary that in all the various professions an unqualified right of resignation exists.  Whether you are a dispensary medical officer, a county medical officer or a vocational teacher, you have an unqualified right of resignation from your post.  Why should we deny that to one of the finest of all the professions?</P>

      <P>Not at all.  We know perfectly well that there are so many in the Civil Service, as in other services, comfortably tapping their boots against the last declining months of their service when they can get out. We know perfectly well from experience that within the Army itself even when minimum pension rights are reached by a number of people they do get out.  Remember this, that the officer who elects, for reasons best known to himself, to resign may not be doing the State an injury but in many cases his precipitous act may do himself a lot of harm.  The Minister would need to review generally the situation with regard to retaining an officer for any lengthy period at all in the Army when he has expressed a desire to get out.  He is bad medicine, he is bad news to the morale of any bunch of officers, particularly if he is in contact with young officers.</P>

      <P>It was introduced in the 1937 Act, so it has been in operation for quite a while.  I said yesterday that Deputy Cowan can make the simplest form of words appear very formidable and he can make us all tremble and begin to ask ourselves how we happened to let certain things through.  Knowing his ability in that respect, I generally keep cool and do not let myself be stampeded.  The case which the Deputy made against the sub-section that he desired to have removed, is, as Deputy Colley stated, an exaggerated one.  I think it could have been made much sounder by a mere statement of facts.  The facts are there.  First of all, I cannot respond to the Deputy's request to give the number whose resignations have been refused, or Deputy Colley's request to give the number accepted; but I can say that the number I have refused amounts to the one case which the Deputy himself mentioned.</P>
      <P>I want the House to realise that, while Deputy Cowan mentioned only one officer, there were four resignations tendered at that time.  These four were from young men who were members of the Air Corps for a very short time and who had not completed their full period of training.  They came to know, by some means of which I am not aware, that Aer Lingus was looking for some air officers and apparently they decided they would have a try.  Aer Lingus were rather impressed, I think, by the ability which they possessed even at that period, and thought it would be good business to offer employment to these young men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resignations were immediately tendered by these young men.  Would I have been justified in accepting them when they were tendered?  These boys had joined the Army as cadets.  They sat for and passed their examinations and were accepted into the Army as cadets.  They were trained as military cadets.  In the course of their training in college, some officer or officers conceived that these young men, because of their magnificent physical qualities &mdash;apart from their military training&mdash; which were outstanding and which must be outstanding if a man is to become a flying officer, seemed to them to be the ideal type for the Air Corps.  Instead of <Col N="262" /> going into the infantry, the artillery, transport, or some other section of the Army, they were given the option of becoming air officers, which they naturally accepted, as one might expect young men to do.  Having been given that opportunity, and having had large sums of money expended on their training in bringing them even to the state of perfection in which they were when their resignations were tendered, would I, or would any Minister, have been justified in accepting the resignations of these young men for the sole purpose of enabling them to better themselves at the expense of the State?</P>
    <P>I ask the House to remember that the State had expended quite an amount of money on their training. Deputy Cowan seems to think that there was nothing wrong in that.  In fact, he anticipated that I would make that statement.  I deem it my duty to make the statement that there was a vast sum of money expended on the training of these boys, and this training was going to be utilised by a commercial concern at the expense of the State.  Would I be right, or would I be justified, in being a party to such a transaction?  I concluded that I would not.  Three of these young men withdrew their resignations when they found what the situation was.  One persisted in going ahead.  I interviewed that young man myself.  I made the position as clear to him as it was possible for me to make it clear to any individual.  I went further, and I promised that young man that, when he had given service of a type which would recompense the Army for the expenditure which had been incurred in regard to his training, I would not stand in his way.</P>
    <P>In confirmation of that, Deputy Cowan himself referred to the recent resignation of two officers in the School of Equitation.  When the resignations of these officers were tendered to me I had no hesitation whatever in accepting them, although I fully realised that we were going to lose two of our most outstanding officers.  I want the House to understand and to realise that these men had given more than 12 years' service to the State and <Col N="263" /> that, as regards whatever money was expended in bringing them to the state of perfection in which they were when they tendered their resignations, we were fully compensated for that payment. Therefore, I naturally would not stand in their way.  They, too, were going to better themselves.  They were fully entitled to do so.  I am pointing out to the House now that it is only in the imagination of Deputy Cowan that we would refuse to accept the resignation of an officer when properly tendered in circumstances such as I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned early on that the only resignation which I refused to accept, and which I recommended to the Government that the President should not be advised to accept, was that particular one.  I rather imagine that, in the whole history of the Army, the number of resignations which were refused could probably be counted on the fingers of one hand.  I am merely mentioning these facts to make it clear to the House that the clause to which Deputy Cowan is objecting is a clause which provides some safeguard against that type of young man coming into the Army and utilising it as a means by which he can perfect himself in a short time in order to better himself at the expense of the Army.  Having secured the knowledge, experience and training which the Army had given him, he then discards the Army.  I certainly will not be a party to that, and I would ask the members of the House not to be a party to it either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also said that the only place he knew of where a man could not leave of his own free will was a prison.  I daresay that is perfectly correct.</P>

Take apprentices.  An apprentice has to bind himself to a period of training. In some cases it is five years and in others seven years.  If an apprentice attempts to break his apprenticeship he is going to find himself in very serious difficulty.  He probably will not be able to secure employment in that particular kind of business anywhere in the country because the trade unions themselves would not be a party to that type of conduct.  They would ensure that, where an apprenticeship was entered into, the individual concerned would have to carry out his part of the contract, the employer doing likewise.</P>

I think that the same thing can be said in the case of students who enter the professions. Every student who enters, say, the medical profession must go through a period of training which, I think, covers something like seven years.  The student has no chance of cutting short that period of seven years.  At least, I do not think so.  He must do his examinations and these cover a period of seven years.  He cannot abscond.  If he does he injures nobody but himself. There is, if you like, a form of compulsion there.  It is no more than what we are enforcing in this sub-section to which Deputy Cowan has taken exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, firstly, to cure retrospectively a defect in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, that was brought to light by the quashing in the High Court of two provisional orders under Part III of the Act fixing the lawful rent of certain premises, and, secondly, to secure, so far as possible, that the interests of the particular persons on whose application the defective provisional orders in question were made, and any others who may find themselves in the same boat by the time that this Bill is enacted, are not allowed to suffer by reason of the defect I speak of, so that what everyone knows to have been the intention of the Legislature shall not be frustrated to the detriment of the interests of the tenants of small premises.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the purpose of Part III of the Act of 1946 was to enable a justice to deal privately, and without the necessity for a hearing in court, with applications for provisional orders from the tenants of small premises and until the procedure was challenged a few months ago, it was assumed by all concerned that a justice was authorised and empowered to deal with all such cases in this way.  The High Court has now decided that where it is necessary to make an apportionment of the rent in respect of partly furnished or partly serviced premises, it is the court alone that is competent to make the apportionment. The consequence is that applications from the tenants of small premises which are partly furnished or partly serviced cannot be dealt with by a justice sitting in private until the rent has been apportioned by the court. Needless to say, this was never intended and the purpose of Section 2 of the Bill is to cure this defect and to cure it retrospectively but not so as to validate a provisional order which has been quashed before this Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But although it is not proposed to <Col N="266" /> validate a provisional order which has already been quashed, neither is it proposed to leave the small tenants on whose application the quashed provisional orders were made in a position where, through a defect in the law frustrating the intention of the Legislature and through no fault of their own, they may have to pay a rent that is grossly in excess of the lawful rent in respect of a period extending over 14 months after the time they had sought to have the matter put right.  Consequently, we are providing against this possibility by the provisions of Section 3.  The effect of the section is that the district justice is required to make a fresh provisional order which will be effective as from the date upon which the tenant ought originally to have been able to have his rent fixed, while safeguarding the landlord's right of appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the recent decision of the High Court referred to by the Minister which has necessitated the bringing in of this amending Bill. We are in complete agreement with the proposals in Section 2 and in complete agreement with the reinstating of the practice which, before the recent decision of the High Court, for many years, since the passing of the Act of 1946, had been followed in the courts.  It would be a great hardship on many tenants who have had provisional orders made if this Bill were not passed, because, as a result of the decision of the President of the High Court, many provisional orders which had not been appealed against by the landlord could now be quashed by <i>certiorari</i> in the High Court, and I thoroughly agree that it would be wrong for the Legislature to allow such a state of circumstances without interfering in the way suggested by Section 2.  In the special circumstances of this case, I am in complete agreement with legislating retrospectively to the extent that any provisional orders which have been made in the past and in the body of which it appears that an apportionment has been made by the District Court, in the special circumstances of Section 28 of the 1946 Act, should be deemed good retrospectively as is proposed by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> There is, however, one very important matter of principle involved in Section 3 and I think the Dáil should carefully consider, before Section 3 is passed, whether it is prepared to legislate retrospectively in the manner proposed by Section 3.  The position, as I understand it, is that, as a result of the decision of the President of the High Court, the contract rent which was entered into between the landlord and the tenant in the case which was the subject of the proceedings in the High Court is good and the tenant is liable to pay his contract rent as a result of that decision.  The landlord has many remedies open to him if the tenant does not pay his contractual rent and we are now proposing to take away legal rights from the landlord in this case, rights which he has as a result of that High Court decision.  I presume that there are many weeks' arrears of rent due to him as a result of it which he is anxious to obtain.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misinterpreted in any way in what I am saying in this regard.  I spend a lot of my time appearing for tenants and I have the utmost sympathy with tenants and with the tenant in this particular case, although I should say that I do not know his name or the name of the landlord but we should appreciate what it is proposed to do by this Section 3.  We are proposing retrospectively to take away a right from an individual and our judgment in meeting this question of principle should not be altered in any way by dwelling too much on the fact that the individual in question is a landlord. We must face the principle that in this case, as a result of that decision of the High Court, an individual has got a legal right which we are proposing to take away from him.</P>
    <P>It is a very important matter of principle and I think we should not be legislating retrospectively in the way proposed by the section to take away from any person a legal right no matter what the legal right may be. There may be very many cases in which the High Court or Supreme Court decision could be invalidated and doing great injustice to the parties <Col N="268" /> concerned merely by bringing in a measure such as this to do away with a right which the High Court or the Supreme Court has declared that person to have.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have the utmost sympathy with the tenant in this particular case. I have the utmost sympathy with somebody who believed he had a legal right, and it transpires when this particular point is brought for the first time to the notice of the High Court he has not got the right.  But, as I say, it is a question to a very great extent of principle, not an academic one but a very important one, and I think Section 3 as it stands should not be passed into law for the reason that we are taking away rights from an individual.  I would suggest, perhaps, that the tenant in this particular case should be entitled to go back to the District Court and have a provisional order made and that the rent to be paid by him would be the rent determined by the provisional order, or, if there is an appeal from it under Section 31, by the District Court, or, if there is an appeal from that, by the Supreme Court.  I think that the rent to be paid by the tenant in this particular case should be the contract rent until it is varied by an order of the District Court.  I feel that the sympathy which we all must have with the particular individual concerned in this case should not blind us to the fact that we are deliberately taking away a legal contractual right from an individual.  The Dáil, I think, should not pass an Act doing that merely because the person who has the contractual right is a landlord and may use it against the tenant with whom we all have sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have not seen the decision other than the report in the papers but, as I think the Minister pointed out in his opening speech, up to now District Courts have been apportioning the rent of small premises when tenants of small premises have come in to have <Col N="269" /> their basic rent fixed by the District Court.  When it appears, under Section 3, that certain payments are made by the tenant, not only in respect of rent but also in respect of light or heat or the use of furniture, then it has been the practice of the District Court when making the provisional order to apportion the rent&mdash;portion of it in respect of light, portion in respect of heat, portion in respect of the use of furniture&mdash;and thereby to discover whether the case is a case to which the Act refers or not.  When that apportionment is made it then goes on to fix what, in its opinion, should be the basic rent.  It has now been decided by the High Court that the right of the district justice sitting in private to apportion the rent in that manner is not given by the Act, and all those provisional orders, many hundreds of which, I am sure, have never been appealed against, are now bad orders because district justices have been making this apportionment under Section 3 wrongly.  As I say, I am quite in agreement with giving them power which, as the Minister said, was intended by the Act of 1946&mdash;giving them power to apportion the rent, and the application is made under Section 28 in the manner in which they have been doing it up to now.  The effect of the judgment was that the order made in this particular case by the district justice was a bad order and consequently the contractual rent stood, and as a result of that quashing of that provisional order this unfortunate tenant owes, I am sure, many pounds of arrears of rent to his landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are proposing to do by Section 3 now is to allow the tenant to go back to the district justice and have his basic rent fixed by a provisional order.  I should say that I am not against the principle of allowing the tenant to go back because in effect what we are doing by this Act is to allow all tenants who have got provisional orders which have not been appealed against to get their provisional orders without fear of their being set aside on application by the landlord.  Therefore, I am of opinion that the tenant in this particular case should be allowed to go back and get his basic rent fixed, but the position at <Col N="270" /> the moment is that he owes some money to the landlord which the landlord is entitled to under the law at the moment.  The law as it stands is that the landlord is entitled to certain money for his rent.  What is proposed by Section 3 is to allow the tenant to return to the District Court and get his provisional order.  If not varied subsequently by the District Court or the Circuit Court the rent he has to pay is the rent fixed by the provisional order as from the first gale day after the order of <i>certiorari</i> was made.  As I have said the effect will be in this particular case that the tenant is going to go back and get his provisional order made and the landlord will not be entitled to his contractual rent and to the legal right which he has at the moment as a result of the High Court decision.  I think we should be very chary indeed about taking away rights from people.  We should not be prejudiced by the fact that in this case this man might be taking a rent which might be high and exorbitant, for all I know, from the tenant.  I think a principle is involved in it and we should not waive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It rather conditions my argument; that is why I asked the question.  Here we have a case where apparently for what I might call a technical reason the High Court has intervened to quash orders <Col N="271" /> already made, and Deputy Costello has raised the point of retrospective legislation.  I think that most of us who have had any experience in these matters as worked out in practice in the courts and elsewhere are very reluctant to concede in any case where it can be avoided retrospective enactment, particularly where there is any question of taking away existing rights; and to that extent I should be inclined, if that were merely all that was involved in this, to support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Costello.  Perhaps it would be as well to safeguard myself by saying that I think the principle in general which he has stated is sound.</P>
      <P>But here we have something different.  It is true that technically, on a strict technical construction of the law, that will be the effect of Section 3; but we in this House have to look further than the mere technical construction of enactments.  That is what is peculiarly our function&mdash;to define and give effect to intention. That particular function which we have may be contrasted with the function the courts have.  In the case of the courts they are constrained by the terms of an enactment in construction. No court under our system may look to parliamentary debates, or to any other extraneous sources, for evidence of intention.  That is why many of us frequently point out that a ministerial assurance here carries no weight whatsoever when it comes to giving effect to the enactments of this House in a court of law.  That is the position in which the court finds itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are in an entirely different position.  It is our prerogative to provide for the reality.  It is our prerogative to deal with the specific problems that arise on the base of justice in its real sense as against&mdash;shall I say?&mdash; an unswerving adherence to precedent. Many of the principles that rule the courts should also rule us here as principles of experience, but I do not think we should be bound to the same extent; we should be cautious; we should be alive to all the problems, but I do not think we should ever accept that we are bound, in the same way as a court <Col N="272" /> of law is bound, by precedent or by the rules which bind a court in regard to interpretation even where retrospective legislation is concerned.  It is a very good thing that the courts lean to interpretation in that way because it is a safeguard for us as well as for them.  Nevertheless, our case is somewhat different, and I make these remarks because I feel that principle should not be lost sight of by us, while still preserving our freedom to legislate.</P>
    <P>What are the actual facts as distinct from the law in this particular case? What is the reality as distinct from the law?  I, like Deputy Costello, have no personal knowledge of the case at all, but the facts appear to be that in 1946 an Act was passed by this Legislature the provisions of which intended, and were heretofore operated to mean, that in the case of certain dwellings, the subject-matter of Part III of the Act of 1946, a certain cheap procedure would apply whereby a tenant could make application to a district justice. It was, and is, clearly the intention of this Act that the district justice would exercise the powers of the court and that he would make an order.  Section 30 provided for the safeguarding of the landlord's position.  Now, that was the clear intention of the Act. That was to be the law and any time after the passing of the Act the tenant was to have the benefit of its provisions. Likewise, the landlord was to have the benefit of its provisions in relation to him and both the landlord and the tenant were mutually to have the protection of the Act as enacted by this Legislature.</P>
    <P>That being so, a situation has now arisen whereunder an order has been quashed.  The reason why I was anxious to know the grounds was because if the order had been quashed on some substantial ground which deprived his landlord of the right to enforce his rights at the time the order was made I would perhaps take a different view.  For instance, if the application was made privately, if the provision that a copy be served on the landlord had not been complied with, and if the grounds of the decision had been such as would deprive the landlord of a real right, then I think I <Col N="273" /> would be arguing in the same sense as Deputy Costello.</P>
    <P>In the net, the grounds of the decision are simple.  The procedure was complied with.  The landlord had full knowledge and he had the right to come back and assert his side.  All that was wrong was a technical construction of terms, but no substantial injustice was done and for that reason I think it is legitimate for us to face the situation.  No substantial damage has been done to either party by the original order.  That view is tantamount to saying that a substantial case made by the appellant, or the person who applied for the order of <i>certiorari</i> in this case was established as against a purely technical one.  If that technical point were not there, the decision would have been on the merits.  I grant you that is an assumption on my part and I am, therefore, open to correction; but, if that is the case, then this is a situation wherein retrospective legislation is justifiable.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I am building on the premises of a technicality but, presuming that to be the case, it seems to me the tenant applied in the way intended under the Act, and in conformity with the provisions of the Act, to a district justice privately under the enabling section of Part III.  The district justice consequentially made an order, provisional in its nature.  In so doing, he exceeded his jurisdiction technically in making certain apportionments but he otherwise acted in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Act and in accordance with the intention of this Legislature when the Act was originally passed here in 1946 and universally applied since in every case.  All the subsequent provisions in relation to safeguarding the landlord's rights were likewise complied with and the landlord had the opportunity at all times of moving within the same machinery to assert his claims.  Presumably he did so.  The machinery operated in reality in compliance with the intention of the Act until the situation was upset on a matter of construction.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies which would be the greater injustice: to amend a technically <i>ab initio</i> and leave the parties in the position in which it was intended <Col N="274" /> they should be left, a position of equality <i>vis-à-vis</i> all the other applications made in court which do not come under this section but are nevertheless ruled by the same principle, or nullify the tenant's rights?  Remember, we are in a cleft stick.  Deputy Costello has pointed out that there is an element of retrospective legislation here which operates against the landlord. I can equally well point out that if certain other steps are taken the Bill will equally have the effect of retrospective legislation against the tenant because the tenant is in the position that he had rights accruing to him under this Act at the time he made his application.  Had there been no technical hitch he would as from the time he got his order be in a position to obtain his rights and have the benefit thereof.  To legislate for the landlord would deprive the tenant of certain rights.  We cannot escape the dilemma that in effect we are legislating retrospectively against someone. We will hit either the tenant or the landlord.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances, I think the solution offered by the Bill is probably the best one, again being very careful to agree with the principles and sentiments expressed by Deputy Costello in relation to retrospective legislation.  If we adjust the position in the way it is proposed to adjust it, we will do no more than provide for the implementation of the Act as it was originally intended it should be implemented.  The expression is very very clear from a common-sense point of view.  It is, if you like, the <i>status quo,</i> but the intention of the Act is very very clear; all you are doing is to regularise something which happened which was in no way in reality at variance with the intention of the Act.  That is all that is being done in this case.</P>
    <P>There is another slight point about it. Again, I am at some disadvantage, not being in immediate contact and not having the report.  As I understand it, the effect of the High Court order is to quash the existing order.  It does not do anything more than that, but it does raise a number of questions.  It raises the possibility presumably of the landlord suing for arrears on the basis of <Col N="275" /> the contract, the contract rent always ruling, as Deputy Costello pointed out. It does not debar the tenant from making an application now.  We must always presume that the decision of the district justice was right in substance because every lawyer knows that if there is an appeal you rely on a technicality in the last resort.  Perhaps that is rather a sweeping way of putting it, but the court rather leans to the reality than the technicality if at all possible.  So, presumably, the court order was a just one and the tenant will be able to apply now, but he will be open to an action for arrears if he does not pay or compulsion through the threat of an action to pay the arrears.</P>
    <P>Then we are back to the question of depriving the landlord of rights which he has under the Act, whether we agree with it or not.  I do not want to go into that issue, but I do think that the landlord's rights are something which ought to be preserved and looked at.  They are things by no means to be overlooked because they have already been severely limited.</P>

      <P>I think the landlord's rights have been so severely restricted that in the case of further restriction they are entitled to very careful examination.  Nevertheless, taking that view of the case, of the two evils, if you like to look at it from the point of view of retrospective legislation, of choosing whether you are going to legislate against the tenant or the landlord, I think the course taken in this Bill is the preferable one of the two, and to that extent I would disagree with Deputy Costello, while admitting fully the force of the principle upon which he based his argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I share the view expressed in regard to retrospective legislation, but at the same time I do not think it can be condemned entirely.  It has been admitted by Deputy Costello that the intention of the 1946 Act was to act fairly as between landlord and tenant and to have equitable rents fixed.  If <Col N="276" /> that were the intention of the House, and I think it is not denied that it was the intention, and it is now found that the courts are not interpreting the legislation in that manner, we have no option but to enact the legislation which is suggested here.  I think Deputy de Valera struck the nail on the head when he said somebody will be victimised, either the landlord or the tenant.</P>
      <P>I think the issue is quite clear.  If it were the intention of the House in 1946 to protect the tenant's rights it is now up to this House to ensure that the tenant's rights will be protected. It cannot be forgotten that if the landlord was fortunate enough to get away with an exorbitant rent from the period the tenant went into possession until the application was made he has not much of a grievance, because I think it is obvious that exorbitant rents were being charged in this case. I am not concerned with technicalities at all.  I am concerned with morality, and morally, to my mind, the tenant is entitled to the legislation which was intended and no mere technical juggle by any court should be allowed to operate which will militate against the tenant and deprive him of the rights which this House intended to give him. I may say, in conclusion, that I have not the slightest qualm of conscience in giving my support to legislation of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I wish to make is one which has already been made.  I do not think anyone will quarrel with the intention behind the section of the 1946 Act and, undoubtedly, Deputies on all sides are anxious to see that the intention is implemented.  Whenever Acts are passed here they are intended to express the intention of the Legislature. If subsequent defects are found in the legislation then they may operate either to confer a right on an individual or individuals or may impose some liability on somebody else.  But what we regard as a matter of principle is that in this case&mdash;and I do not think we should allow our minds to be coloured entirely by the fact that in this particular case it is the landlord, because we are all in favour of <Col N="277" /> the provisions of Part III of the 1946 Act&mdash;because of a technical defect in the Act which was discovered by the landlord or, more likely, by the landlord's legal adviser, we now by legislation propose to take away from that individual a right which he or she, as the case may be, secured as a result of an application to the courts.  While we are not bound in any way by precedents &mdash;in many cases, we do not follow precedents&mdash;I think there is a question of principle involved.  In this case, there was a defect in the Act which may be described as a technical defect.  Nevertheless, this probably means to the person concerned something of value which we here seek by legislation to take away from an individual who has established his or her right.  That does not in any way interfere with the decision which the House will undoubtedly take to make clear that other decisions, where a district justice made a provisional order, should not be invalidated merely by reason of a technical defect in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are all quite satisfied that no other cases which have been decided by means of provisional orders and which have not been appealed and have since become so far as the persons involved are concerned, legally binding on them should be affected, but I think there is a question of principle involved that this House should not, except for very exceptional reasons, either where the public good or the well-being of a certain number of persons is concerned, by retrospective legislation interfere with a right which a person has established.  That is a question of principle.  In this case, I do not know, but I understand that the amount of money involved may not be a big sum to either party, but it could probably be a considerable sum to any tenant.  I think we should not by retrospective legislation take away a right which a person has established.  The principle is sound. We all have sympathy with the individuals affected and indeed it is easy to allow our views to be coloured probably by the fact that in this case it was the landlord who secured this right.  Nevertheless because we are prepared to see that the intention is carried out we are certainly going to <Col N="278" /> make effective the intention of the Legislature as expressed in the 1946 Act, but I still think there is a question of principle, and I would be glad if the Minister would consider a suitable amendment.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief on this.  The amount of money involved has no bearing whatsoever on our attitude or the attitude of this group to a measure of this kind.  We have over a long period of years and on every matter opposed the introduction and passage of retrospective legislation, if I might put it that way.  The surrounding circumstances that concern the necessity for the introduction of this measure have been fairly, fully and satisfactorily explained to the members of this group and the introduction and passage of this amending measure is going to help to give effect to the original intention.  It is for that reason, and that reason only, and not for the purpose of creating a new precedent that I will, with these few words, allow this measure to go through without opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that the Government did not light heartedly bring in this measure.  They foresaw that people were going to raise the points raised by Deputies Costello and Cosgrave, but they had to take into consideration the equities as well as the actual letter of the law. As Major de Valera says, the dilemma was that they were going to hurt somebody, either the landlord or the tenant, and they had to consider the equities of the case.  In all the circumstances we were satisfied that it would be a <Col N="279" /> far greater hardship on the tenant, because it was clear that every Deputy who has spoken and everybody who recollects the passage of the 1946 Act through the House is satisfied that was definitely the intention of the Legislature.  By a mere technicality, it has been held that in apportioning the rent between the amenities of furniture and light, or something of that kind, the wrong procedure was adopted.  While, so far as we ever knew, we had made it the same both for an empty room and a room with a certain amount of furniture, apparently the court held that we did not do that effectively.  What we are doing now is putting the tenant back in the position he was in when the application was first made.  On the whole, I think we are justified in doing that.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much more I can say about it.  Since the Act was passed everybody else who proceeded under this Act had got the benefit of it and these people in this particular case did not.  We have decided that the equities are on the side of the tenant and therefore we put Section 3 into the Bill.  I think in all the circumstances the House would be wise to accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  But we have to deal with things as they arise.  There was at least one measure in which a statutory right was taken away from people by retrospective legislation. There was objection to that, of course, but this could not be a precedent.  If the equities were not as they are I would not have brought this in but I think everybody will say if the rent is reduced from say 40/- to 9/7 the tenant has no possibility of accumulating that amount of money.  How are they possibly going to pay it?  The amount of money has certainly something to do with it.  A person earning a week's wages would find it practically impossible to pay such an amount because we all know these people want the <Col N="280" /> money for the necessities of life, and if the rent is allowed to accumulate that way they are simply put in a position in which they would never have been if they had not thought that they had full rights under the Act.  That is the consideration that induced the Government to approve bringing that in in that form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain points were made by Deputy Colley and by the Minister in regard to this matter.  I think the defence made for the provision in the Bill, both by Deputy Colley and by the Minister, was not a convincing one.  Deputy Colley said that the case I was making in regard to this was exaggerated.  I do not think so.  I do not think it is possible to exaggerate such an important matter.  It is too serious to be dealt with other than in an outspoken, outright and forthright fashion.  I simply pointed out the very serious objections there were to such a provision as this in a permanent Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point&mdash;I do not think he did it deliberately&mdash;that it is reasonable for the State to get back in service from a young man who joins the Defence Forces some of the money spent on training him to be an officer.  He made that point perfectly plain, referring to the two officers who resigned recently from the horse jumping section of the Army who had rendered, as he said, 12 years' service and more than repaid the money expended on their training.  He put that against the case of the young Air Force officers who wanted to resign a short time after they were commissioned at a time when the Army could not have hoped to recover from them the moneys spent on their training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that there is a serious implication in that matter which will react unfavourably against the Defence Forces.  If a young man feels that in joining the Defence Forces on the present interpretation of the effect of this section in the Act he can be kept against his will in the position of Army officer for a period of years sufficient to enable the Army to say to themselves: &ldquo;This man repaid for his training and we will let him go,&rdquo; I think that will have a detrimental effect on the Defence Forces.  It is a point of <Col N="282" /> view that should not be accepted by the House or by the country.</P>
    <P>The analogy in regard to apprenticeship does not really apply because apprenticeship in the Defence Forces so far as commissioned rank is concerned means, if it means anything, the period during which a cadet is being trained to be an officer and which, from the point of time, is a period of a couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>A young man goes into the Army with a very high standard of education.  He is accepted as suitable for a cadetship after many exacting tests.  Undoubtedly, he receives a course of training that is excellent in itself and at the end of that period, if he is fortunate enough to qualify in all his different examinations, it will enable him to become the material for a first-class officer.  Once commissioned, his period of apprenticeship ends.  That is my argument entirely basing it on the analogy of the apprentice in the trade or in a profession or the student in a school.</P>
      <P>There is no other profession that I know of in which a man can be compelled to serve against his will.  A man cannot be compelled to serve as a doctor against his will even if he gets his qualifications in the training school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if he gets his qualifications from a State scholarship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and even if he goes to the university and qualifies in law, medicine, commerce, engineering or in any profession, he may resign and give up that particular profession if he so wishes, although the great bulk of the moneys expended on qualifying him in the universities is, in fact, State subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I instanced, in an interruption, the case of a civil servant.  A young man may join the Civil Service and may have high qualifications.  He may be appointed to some particular post in the Civil Service in which he obtains a knowledge that would be very useful to him in another capacity outside the Civil Service altogether.  He cannot be <Col N="283" /> kept there, but we have this particular clause put in to say that the officer belongs to a different type of profession, not the honourable profession we understood it to be, but a lower class of profession in which he will be deprived of certain fundamental freedoms and liberties.  Again, that is one of the objections I have to the Bill. This is a new conception of the officer as being in a lower type of profession than we always understood and, in fact, the majority of the members of this House understand at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>But the analogy between the Civil Service and the Army for pay indicates the Civil Service mind on the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly.  That is what I object to.  The officer in the Army has a profession and has professional standards of a very high nature, and we find this lowering and debasing of the standards running right through this Act.  There is a very strong case being made against this provision and it is not an exaggerated one.  The Minister says, of course, that we must be realists and that is an argument which the Minister frequently advances; in other words, the Minister's mind is this: &ldquo;I would not do a thing like that and I am the type of person who could not conceive another doing it.&rdquo;  I think that is a fair way to put the Minister's approach to this Act and to other matters.  Unfortunately, history is studded with examples of people doing things that reasonable people did not believe they would do, and it is to provide against that type  thing that legislators and statesmen in all the Constitutions that they have the opportunity in democratic countries of enacting make what provision they can against the misuse of power, because once power is given it can be misused.  Where you say in this section that the President may refuse to accept the resignation of a commission by an officer, you are giving some person the power to advise the President&mdash;because the President must act all the time on advice&mdash;to say: &ldquo;No.  We will not do that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> Take the case of an officer serving in the American Forces prior to the last Presidential Election who was mentioned in the propaganda as being a likely and very successful candidate. Supposing the powers-that-be there refused to accept the resignation of that officer, it could have had very serious political effects.  I think it could happen, not perhaps now but at some future time in this country, that considerations such as that might enter into the question as to whether an officer would resign or would not. Once there are all those possibilities of misuse of a provision, the provision should not be there.</P>
    <P>When a young man joins the Army and becomes an officer, he has the idea of making that his career, of serving in it and reaching the highest ranks. However, he may change his outlook; he may, for instance, desire to go into a more secluded life.  He may wish to go into a monastery, study for the Church or do something else of that kind.  Does anyone say that, in those circumstances, the Minister would refuse to accept his resignation no matter what amount of money was spent on his education?  But it can be refused, as in the case I mentioned here to-night, where an officer desired to leave a technical corps and to obtain a position in the technical service of the State in which he would be, in the matter of pay, much above his own fellows in the corps in which he was serving.  There is always the danger, human nature being what it is, that a little element of personal jealousy could be responsible for a recommendation that that particular resignation would not be accepted because, as we all know, it has to go through many channels from the very lowest up to the Minister and if it starts off with a recommendation that it be not accepted it is difficult on the way up for somebody else to take a different line.  There is the danger that the human element can enter into it to the prejudice of a particular individual.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Collins has said that, perhaps, this matter might have been worded somewhat differently and that there would be some little reasonable time lag to which <Col N="285" /> nobody could take any exception. There is, of course, no validity or substance in the point that was made by Deputy Colley that this provision will prevent an officer who has committed an offence getting out before he can be brought to book.  Deputy Colley, perhaps, would not have the intimate internal knowledge that other Deputies have in regard to the court-martial or disciplinary procedure that is in the Army, particularly in regard to this hidden clause&mdash;which even quite a number of people who have served in the Army from the very beginning are not familiar with&mdash;whereby a person may be court-martialled within a certain period of his ceasing to be subject to military law.  That has only been exercised to my knowledge on one occasion, a very famous occasion, too, which I think is remembered by some other Deputies.  It received a considerable amount of publicity at the time.  It was a very important case and the provisions of the Act, obscure as they were, were brought into operation for the purpose of trying under the provisions of military law a person who had for a substantial period prior to that ceased to be subject to military law.  Therefore, that defence of the section in relation to a person trying to avoid punishment for a criminal offence is not a good defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the belief that his point was so.  Once a person commits a crime or an offence against civil law, that offence is tryable by the civil authorities within certain statutory periods laid down in the law and if he is subject to military law he may be tried by the military authorities. If he ceases to be subject to military law he can be tried by the civil power.  I do not think that the Minister himself would adopt that as <Col N="286" /> an argument in favour of the section as it stands.  I have put forward the argument that that should not be in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will reconsider it and that he will agree that it is unwise to have a provision such as that in the Bill when the effects of it may be to cause considerable concern to young people who may be considering the Army as their career and to cause considerable trouble and annoyance in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>A person may intend to adopt the Army as a career and, for one reason or another, may change his mind.  That happens in nearly every profession.  We have spoiled people of all kinds, as they are referred to, who had the idea that they were intended for a particular profession and who discovered subsequently that they had not the necessary requirements for that particular profession.  If an officer submits his resignation on the basis that he is going to something not so good, the possibility is that it may be accepted, whereas if it is known that he is going to improve himself then it will be refused. That is the whole basis of the injustice that can be caused by this, because it deals with a matter that should be dealt with on its merits.  It should be dealt with as a matter of justice to an individual, with the rights of an individual, and not on the basis: &ldquo;This fellow has used the Army to perfect or improve himself in another profession.  We will not let him do it.&rdquo;  That would be a very bad approach to a problem of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that in all the period during which he was a Minister&mdash;and he has been a Minister a long time&mdash;since the 1937 <Col N="287" /> Act was first introduced, he knew of only one case in which a resignation was refused&mdash;and that, unfortunately, had the tragic consequences that I mentioned earlier this evening.  Nobody knows how or when or why death comes, but it is regretable that it should have occurred in this one case in which the resignation of the officer was refused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> I think the Minister would agree himself, on reflection, that a good case has not been made for the section as it stands, that a better case was made for the amendment and that he should see to it that my amendment is incorporated in this Bill before it reaches its final stages.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is largely to replace the existing Section 63 by a new section.  I do not think I need worry the House with the reasons for redrafting the existing section. They are of a technical nature, revolving round the interpretation of the expression &ldquo;term of original enlistment.&rdquo; The only new provision put into the new section is one which permits a man, who has been transferred to the Reserve Force from the Permanent Force, to extend the term of his original enlistment.  Otherwise, it is purely a matter of interpretation and drafting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 47, Section 84, to insert before sub-section (3), line 18, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) (a)  A non-commissioned officer shall not be reduced in rank under sub-section (2) of this section unless and until the reason for the proposed reduction has been communicated to him and such non-commissioned officer has been given a reasonable opportunity of making such representation as he may think proper in relation to the proposed reduction.</P>
      <P>(b)  Paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall not apply during a period of emergency or in respect of a non-commissioned officer who is on active service.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the debate on the section in the Special Committee, and it provides that, except during a period of emergency or active service, a non-commissioned officer will not be reduced without being given an opportunity of making representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to explain that, during active service conditions, it would be quite impossible to delay reductions for the purpose of enabling the men concerned to make representations.  The matter would then have to be dealt with swiftly and, if fighting were in progress, would have <Col N="293" /> to be left to commanding officers in the field.  As regards a period of emergency it would also be difficult to confer any right.  During an emergency many people are promoted who, after a while, are found not to be fitted for the higher rank and who must, in the interests of the Defence Forces as well as their own, be reduced.  It is really nothing against them; it is just that they are found to be unable for, or unsuited to, the duties and responsibilities of the higher rank.  In these circumstances, it is useless to have any argument or discussion; the reduction must be effected and that is all there is to it.  In emergency conditions, you cannot always get over the difficulty of finding an alternative job for the man.</P>
    <P>I think the military authorities have gone as far as possible in accepting this rather radical proposal in relation to peace-time Army service.  I should not care to push them in relation to emergency or active service conditions and I hope the Deputies who raised the matter will be satisfied with the present compromise.</P>

      <P>Having pressed this matter in the Special Committee, I am glad that the Minister has met it to the extent that he has met it.  In other words, as far as ordinary peace time is concerned now, a non-commissioned officer cannot be reduced in rank unless he gets a reasonable opportunity of making such representations as he may think proper in relation to the proposed reduction. That is a measure of justice which everyone will agree with and which will be welcomed undoubtedly by the soldiers and non-commissioned officers.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that while we must have a protection such as this &mdash;and I am glad he has inserted it&mdash;in ordinary peace time, in the case of a was situation or of active service obviously other conditions would have to apply.  I can only hope that the spirit of justice in relation to this matter that will apply in ordinary peace time will apply during an emergency or in a state of war or active service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 49, Section 88 (2), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;(not exceeding 1,500)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 88 provides that the reservists may be called out on permanent service under certain conditions.  A reservist who has entered into an agreement in writing to be liable to be called out on permanent service or who has not revoked his agreement, can be called out in the circumstances set out in the section.  However, sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever operations for the defence of the State are in preparation or in progress, the Government may authorise the Minister to give such directions as he thinks necessary with regard to the calling out on permanent service of reservists (not exceeding 1,500) to whom this section applies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, it is a matter of mechanics.  I think it is unwise for the Minister to limit himself to calling out 1,500 reservists.  I think it is unwise for the Army Staff at the moment to insert a clause such as that into permanent regulations.  It is unwise for the Minister to bind a successor of his to that limitation.  It seems to me that if operations for the defence of the State are in progress it would be a strange state of affairs if the Government, with the responsibility of defending the State, could be told they could call out 1,500 and no more.</P>
      <P>I can do nothing in regard to a section such as this except to say that the Minister is unwise to bind himself in that way, that the Government is unwise to be bound in that way and that the Minister has no right to bind his successors, as the binding of the successors in that way may endanger the safety of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for a limitation such as this except what I have been referring to here this evening, and which Deputy Collins has been referring to also, that it is the mean, financial mind that is operating. The safety of the State, or what is necessary or vital to that safety, is not <Col N="295" /> to be considered at all; it would cost so much to call out 1,500 and therefore, even though the State may be in danger, the Minister or the Government cannot be allowed to call out one man more.  There is no reason for such a limitation.  I simply propose that the section be deleted.  I am absolutely satisfied to leave to a Government, when operations for the defence of the State are in progress, the discretion as to the number of reservists they will call out under this particular section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that for once I can express myself in complete and absolute agreement with Deputy Cowan.  Frankly, I do not see the sense of prescribing a limitation.  I agree with Deputy Cowan that it seems to be unnecessary and dangerously hampering to prescribe that limit.  The intention should be that the Government, through the Minister, could call up just as many of the reserves as are necessary in the situation.</P>
      <P>That might mean a consequential amendment.  One would question whether the simple deletion that Deputy Cowan suggests might be enough, in that it might imply the calling up of all or none.  As Deputy Cowan says, it is merely a question of mechanics, and if it is made quite clear that the Minister may call up any proportion he wishes, it would be preferable from the point of view of legislation. Frankly, I cannot see any reason for the limitation.  It may be that there is some idea of constitutional protection, but let us be realists in this matter.  If there is any need to call up reservists at all, it is one of these emergency situations where one has to face hard facts rather than peace-time constitutional law.  If that is the position, it is better to be free to face it rather than otherwise.  Putting up a façade will neither meet one situation nor the other, but will produce an artificial difficulty that may seriously hamper the Executive in a time of crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue that at such short notice and I think we might leave it just for the moment because we are really getting into serious matters now.  This is what I consider to be the whole kernel of the Bill, as far as it affects the Army, and the Minister will, I hope, be patient with me if I have to examine this whole proposal in rather minute detail.  Section 97 deals with the pay and allowances of the Defence Forces. Of course, there is nothing so important to the members of the Defence Forces as the matter of their pay and allowances.  When a soldier joins the Army, or an officer is commissioned, his first and most favourable reaction to military service is the fact that on pay-day he gets into his hand, if he is a soldier, a certain number of pounds, shillings and pence, and if he is an officer that, at the end of the month, he gets a cheque, a nice white piece of paper, value for the number of pounds that represents his rank and pay.  Anything that is going to interfere with the pay of an officer or soldier is a very serious matter for the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the original Defence Forces Act of 1923 was passed, there were certain statutory protections provided for the pay of officers and soldiers, and although there were, in 1924 and subsequently, some amendments to the Act, at least those amendments were made by Oireachtas Éireann, and they <Col N="297" /> had to be justified in open debate in the Dáil.  The provision, relating to pay and allowances, that was in the 1923 Act, was taken entirely out of the British Army Act that was in operation at that time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in previous debates, that when the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923 was before Dáil Éireann it was introduced hurriedly, and to cover a particular situation. The then Minister for Defence asked the Dáil to give him the Bill and to pass it, and said that, as far as he was concerned, it would only operate for one year, and that after that a permanent Bill would be introduced. The permanent Bill that was to be introduced in 1923 is the permanent Bill of 1951 that we are now discussing. That is important, of course, when one considers ministerial intentions in regard to Bills, because the Minister for Defence in 1923 honestly intended and believed that he would be able to bring in his permanent Bill within the time specified.  Circumstances and events interfered, and now we are getting the opportunity of discussing a permanent Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill of 1923 was based on the British Army Act, and the protections that were there for the officer and soldier in regard to their pay and allowances were carried direct from the British Act into the Irish Act, and, with the amendments which I have mentioned, have remained there since. Although there was a statutory protection for officers and soldiers, the one ground of complaint that causes annoyance and irritation in the Army is the provisions that were left in the statute in relation to pay and allowances. The interpretation of those provisions has caused irritation and annoyance over a long period, and if I had known that this section of the Bill would be before the Dáil to-day, I could have armed myself from my own files with case after case showing where injustice was done once it was left to the Minister to decide on deductions from pay.</P>
    <P>The only protections which the soldier and the officer had were the protections that were bluntly laid <Col N="298" /> down here that the pay could not be interfered with at all in certain circumstances, or only in other certain circumstances.  The only genuine protection which they had was where the Act said: &ldquo;You dare not interfere with pay except in certain circumstances,&rdquo; but where the Act did say that the Minister would have the right to interfere with pay there has been an unjust interpretation of the Minister's powers, and a misuse of these powers over many years which has been unjust to the individuals concerned and harmful to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>While the British Army maintain, in the law of their country, the statutory protection for the pay of their soldiers, in 1954 we are proposing to abandon those statutory protections and to give the Minister power to prescribe everything in regard to forfeiture and interference with an officer's or soldier's pay.  I had hoped that, after the case I had made in regard to this matter at the Special Committee, and after the support I had received from other Deputies who were present, the Minister would have been able to say, when he came before the Dáil now, that he would go back to the provisions that were in the Act of 1923, and that he would bring in such amendments as the House might consider necessary to give effect to the claim for justice that has persisted in the Army since the Defence Forces Act of 1923 came into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 126 of the Act of 1923 set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The pay of an officer or soldier of the forces shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorised by this Act, or any regulations to be made thereunder, or by any other Act of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was clear and precise and there could be no objection to the terms of that section; but, in 1954, we are debating a section which commences: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations in relation to the following matters&rdquo;, and I think it is necessary, in order to put it in its proper perspective, to set out the matters laid down in this section.  They are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" />&ldquo;(a)  The rates and scales of pay, allowances and gratuities of members of the Defence Forces,</P>
    <P>(b)  the grants which may be made to members and units of the Defence Forces,</P>
    <P>(c)  the conditions applicable to the issue of such pay, allowances, gratuities and grants.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations in relation to the following matters&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the forfeitures, deductions and stoppages to which the pay, allowances and gratuities of and grants to members of the Defence Forces may be subjected,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the deductions and stoppages to which grants to units of the Defence Forces may be subjected,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the disposition of such forfeitures, deductions and stoppages,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the manner in which and the procedure whereby such forfeitures, deductions and stoppages or any other deductions authorised by this Act are to be made,</P>
    <P>and such forfeitures, deductions and stoppages may be made and disposed of accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have what I term the &ldquo;codding&rdquo; sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made under this sub-section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation has been laid before it, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any forfeiture, deduction or stoppage made under sub-section (2) of this section may be remitted by the Minister in whole or in part.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, we have sub-section (4):&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" />&ldquo;References to pay, allowances, gratuities or grants in this chapter shall be construed as references to pay, allowances, gratuities or grants payable under regulations made under sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister proposes and to do that he proposes to throw overboard the statutory protections laid down in the Act of 1923 which sets out, as I have said, that the pay of an officer or soldier shall be paid without any deduction other than the deductions authorised by the Act, or any regulations to be made thereunder, or by any other Act of the Oireachtas. In other words, when a man joined the Army under that Act, he knew he would be paid his pay except for the deductions laid down in the statute passed by the Parliament of his country, whereas if a man joins the Army after this Bill becomes law, if it becomes law in its present form, he has no such guarantee.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations in regard to the forfeitures, deductions and stoppages to which the pay, allowances and gratuities of and grants to members of the Defence Forces may be subjected.&rdquo;  Then there is this clause which deals with the regulation and which requires that every regulation made under the sub-section shall be laid before the Oireachtas.  Up to this an officer knew that he would automatically forfeit pay for every day of absence on desertion or without leave&mdash;that was perfectly reasonable and he understood it&mdash;for every day he is in custody on a charge for an offence resulting in a conviction by a civil court&mdash;that, again, was perfectly understandable&mdash; and while he is in custody on a charge resulting in a conviction by court-martial unless the court-martial shall otherwise direct.  That was the Act of 1923 as it affected the pay of an officer.</P>
    <P>Under that Act there were certain penal deductions that could be made from the pay of an officer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the sum required to make good such compensation for any expense, loss, damage or destruction occasioned by the commission of any offence as may be awarded by the <Col N="301" /> court-martial by which he is convicted of such offence;</P>
    <P>(b)  the sum required to make good the pay of any officer or soldier which he has unlawfully retained or unlawfully refused to pay;</P>
    <P>(c)  the sum required to pay any fine awarded by a court-martial or the prescribed officer under Section 79 or a civil court;</P>
    <P>(d)  the sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public property, which after due investigation appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is how an officer knew he was circumstanced under the Act of 1923, but on this Bill being passed nobody will know where he is because it is left entirely to regulations, and I think the Minister will agree that the Department of Defence has not the happiest record in the matter of regulations. Where the Department, even under the 1923 Act, got authority to issue regulations, they did so, and the moment they were out, if something was found wrong with them, there was an amending regulation and a subsequent amending regulation.  I think I could say with truth that there have been thousands of regulations issued by the Department of Defence since the 1923 Act was passed and that most of them have been amendments of previous regulations.</P>
    <P>The whole departmental record has been one of dissatisfaction in regard to regulations.  Perhaps that is too mild a way to express it but I do not want to put it stronger.  Nobody knew where he stood under the Defence Force regulations, and particularly Defence Force regulations in so far as they had anything to do with pay or with allowances, because the moment an officer or a soldier established that he had a claim and that he was not caught by a regulation the Department of Defence issued an amending regulation to catch his comrades on the same point.  Is it any wonder that if I can speak with knowledge and experience of that position for many years I would <Col N="302" /> object to what is being done here to throw overboard the law as it is laid down in an Act of Parliament and to give instead to the Department of Defence powers to interfere with the pay and allowances, gratuities and grants of officers and soldiers of the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>I mentioned the protection that was for officers under the old Act.  There was also protection for soldiers.  A soldier knew that his pay would be paid in full and that it would only be forfeited in circumstances that were laid down in the Act of Parliament. First the soldier forfeited pay for every day of absence on desertion or without leave, for every day that he is in custody on a charge for an offence resulting in a conviction by a civil court; whilst he is in custody on any charge not resulting in conviction by a court-martial unless the court-martial shall otherwise direct; while he is in custody on a charge of absence without leave; for every day on which he has been awarded detention by his commanding officer; for imprisonment awarded by a court-martial or civil court; and for every day of detention awarded by a court-martial or his commanding officer.  In 1924 there was a further addition made to that by this House, that for every day he was in hospital on account of sickness certified by the appropriate medical officer attending on him at hospital to have been caused by an offence against this Act committed by him and of which he has been found guilty by a court-martial or a commanding officer.</P>
    <P>A soldier, as I say, up to the moment, knows that his pay will be forfeited and he knows that it is his own Parliament that has laid down that, and that if anybody attempts to forfeit his pay otherwise than in accordance with what is laid down by his Parliament he has the right to go into the courts and then state in the High Court and to get a declaration that that pay was unlawfully withheld and to obtain an order that it must be paid to him.  Those are rights and protections that were given to him under the old Act and which the new Act proposes to throw overboard <Col N="303" /> altogether, and to leave to a Department with the record the Department of Defence has for issuing regulations the right to make regulations governing the conditions under which the pay of that officer or that soldier will be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act a soldier also knew that in addition to forfeits he was subject to certain penal deductions, that he was subject to deduction to pay compensation for any damage. I do not want to go into it in full because it is rather lengthy.  He was required to make good such compensation for any expense, loss, damage or destruction occasioned by the commission of any offence as may be awarded by the court-martial in which he is convicted of such offence, or, where he has confessed the offence and his trial is dispensed with, as may be awarded by a competent military authority; any loss or damage or destruction done by him to arms, ammunition, equipment, clothing, instruments, regimental necessaries, buildings or property as may be awarded on proper investigation by his commanding officer or by a court-martial provided the amount does not exceed £10.  He was liable to make that good.  But in both these cases up to the present they could only be deducted from him if his commanding officer or a court-martial or the competent military authority where he has confessed and his trial is dispensed with has set down the amount that he can pay.</P>
    <P>He was also required to pay his share of barrack damages provided the barrack damages were done or occasioned by the wilful act or negligence of a person in the unit to which he belonged while the unit was in occupation of barracks and he could not be identified.  That is one of the sections I will come to later because it is one of the sections that applies.  There was a very substantial protection there in regard to barrack damages provided the provisions of the Act were adhered to.  The damage had to be wilful damage or negligence in the legal sense of a person who could not be identified belonging to the unit during the period <Col N="304" /> the unit was in occupation.  He had to pay the sum required to pay a fine awarded by a court-martial, his commanding officer, his company commander or a civil court; and in another case where he was the putative father of an illegitimate child he was bound to make certain provision.</P>
    <P>There was a statutory protection that the deductions would not exceed two-thirds of his pay in any one week.  There was a whole code of law in relation to pay and allowances laid down in that statute and in the amendments that were subsequently made to it.  The whole effect of the law was that a man was protected in his pay and in his allowances and it is only right&mdash;I am sure the Minister and the House will agree with me&mdash;that whatever else we do, this House should ensure that the pay of the officer or the soldier is protected and that it will not be interfered with unless under very precise and limited conditions that we ourselves lay down.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the protection that was there, there was the interpretation of certain sections that the Minister was given power under that Act to oblige an officer or a soldier to pay certain sums; for instance, in the case of an officer, the officer would be bound to pay the sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public property which, after due investigation, appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.  That was the one sub-section which gave the Minister power to interfere with pay for that specific purpose, and it is the misinterpretation of that power that has caused all the petty irritation to officers and men over the years.</P>
    <P>We are aware of cases under that section where the gravest injustice has been done to officers and men.  Such is the mentality that has developed in relation to that sub-section, that officers and men have letters addressed to them from superior authorities asking them to show cause why the Minister should not be asked to make an Order against them deducting certain large or small sums from their pay.  I <Col N="305" /> could mention hundreds of cases in relation to that.</P>
    <P>I hoped that with the experience of the years some equitable code in relation to the interpretation of that sub-section would be developed.  It is because it has not developed in relation to the little matter which was left to the Minister under the other Act that I am so strongly opposing the idea here of giving the Minister power to decide everything.  Quite recently I came across a case where a particular officer was sent to do a job of work.  He had scarcely arrived on the job when he was ordered by a superior authority to go elsewhere.  Another officer took over from him.  There was a third officer concerned.  I understand that certain stores were received in bulk&mdash; a very large quantity of them&mdash;and when the official check up was made there was a matter of something approximating to £2 in question in this very large consignment.  It should have been a very simple matter to find out who was at fault, if anybody was at fault, and to find out if, in the handling of such an enormous cargo, anything should be done about this trivial amount.  Some gentleman took it upon himself to come to the conclusion that all three officers were responsible for the loss and that all three should be asked to show cause why the Minister should not make an Order deducting one-third of £2 from their pay.  Imagine the predicament of the officer who was first sent out to do the job and had scarcely arrived on the scene when he found himself transferred elsewhere.  What responsibility would he have?  Why should he be asked to contribute if a superior officer took him off the job and sent him somewhere else since there could not be any proper handing over of duties, responsibilities or anything else?</P>
    <P>Now that is the way this has developed and grown and the person who had the nerve&mdash;and nerve is what I call it&mdash;to come to a conclusion such as that had also the nerve to say that the regulations governing these matters did not seem to be in order and would have to be tightened up.  It is now proposed to ask the Minister to <Col N="306" /> make an Order where the regulations are admitted to be defective.  From an administrative point of view perhaps some question might arise although I am sure that if the matter was investigated no question of deduction would arise.  We have reached the stage where if there is the slightest loss someone has to pay for it and the search then is for the unfortunate individual on whom the authorities will pin the responsibility; they will ask him to give reasons why the Minister should not be asked to make an Order deducting certain sums from his pay.</P>
    <P>The section as it was in the Act laid down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction which, after due investigation, appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would imagine that the normal interpretation of that would be that after examining all the circumstances the Minister would come to the conclusion that a particular officer should be asked to make good a certain sum of money.  But that is not what happens in fact.  Before the matter ever comes to the Minister the officer is asked by someone who has no authority good, bad or indifferent, to show cause why the Minister should not make a deduction from his pay.  I have seen that development with all the consequential petty irritation, annoyance and injustice. Will I calmly sit here as a member of this Legislature and allow this House to throw overboard the protection the officers and soldiers have and put in its place a section which gives full and unlimited scope to the Minister? When we say the Minister we mean, of course, the Minister's advisers or, as he called them yesterday, his experts, who decide that they will interfere in that unjust way with the pay of officers and soldiers.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned as a member of the Dáil, and as far as the Dáil is concerned, this is the most vital matter in this whole Bill that comes before the House.  I cannot see why the Minister wants to abandon the system which has worked well, <Col N="307" /> with the exception of this sub-section in which the Minister is given power and wants to give an opportunity to his officials to make life unbearable for the officers and soldiers in the Army. It is a very strange thing that, although the Department of Defence is officered by officers, by soldiers and by civil servants, we never see a regulation made to deal with the civil servants.  When they make blunders involving hundreds or thousands of pounds, there is no regulation saying that they will be subject to the Minister and that the Minister may make a regulation to make deductions from their pay.  That is what I very strongly object to.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister at this late stage to agree that, where the system in regard to pay and allowances and penal deductions has worked well, to leave it there, but to amend the only sub-section which has caused trouble, instead of making the sub-section which has caused trouble the governing section giving the Minister power to do everything in regard to pay and allowances.  The Minister has endeavoured to amend his own provision somewhat, but that is not sufficient. I have endeavoured in a subsequent amendment to reinstate the position as it was and to try to improve the matters to which general exception has been taken over a long period.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the purpose of this new Bill.  For 30 years, in every Dáil Session some member has asked the Minister when he proposed to bring in the new Bill and for nearly 30 years, certainly for 25 years, the answer has been given that the Bill is in course of preparation and will be introduced at an early date. Why did the people want a new Defence Bill?  They wanted a new Defence Bill so that they would have an opportunity of examining it in detail and of endeavouring to make provision whereby officers and soldiers would receive their pay and allowances as they became entitled to them and so that an opportunity would be given to the House of amending the particular provision to which exception was then being taken.  That is why the question were being asked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> The Army has been looking for a new Bill for a long time, but not for a new Bill just to tighten up the provisions a whereby the Department of Defence could interfere with the pay and allowances of the officers and soldiers. That is not why the Army wanted it. I am inclined to think that the putting in of this provision in the way it is here in Section 97 was done deliberately and with some contempt for our parliamentary institutions as well as for the Defence Forces.  There are circumstances in which it is agreed that it may be necessary to have these powers of regulation.  It may be necessary where Parliament cannot deal with matters in a full way.  It has been found expedient to give Ministers power to make rules and regulations, but that has always been considered an invasion of the rights of Parliament and something to be adopted only in special circumstances.  But here, where you had, in fact, Parliament governing these matters as it did in 1923, where the only item in dispute was one matter, we have the Department preparing a Bill in which they throw the thing overboard, as I said, and put in these few lines giving full right, power, authority and responsibility to the Minister to do what he likes in regard to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say to me that Deputy Cowan knows that he himself would not do anything unjust.  Of course I know that, but I have not the same high opinion of persons who may be Ministers in the future as the Minister has.  I know that some of them are likely to be lazy, to sign whatever is put in front of them by their officials. I know that some of them will be reckless. I know that some of them may be biased.  I know that some of them may have, as Ministers of Defence have had in the past, a malicious approach towards matters that concern the Army.  Because I have seen these things in the past I want to provide against them in the future.  I have said it to-day on another section that as far as the Army is concerned it would be better if this Bill never passed this House than to pass it with that section in it.  If I can by debate or by argument impress on the House the advisability of setting out clearly in <Col N="309" /> the Act where an officer's or soldier's pay is to be affected&mdash;and only to be affected&mdash;then I feel that I will be doing some good.  I ask the Minister as a Minister who obviously has the concern of the Army at heart to agree to meet the viewpoint I am expressing here.  The viewpoint I am expressing is not a point of view that is in any way prejudicial to the Minister as Minister.  It is a viewpoint expressed because of the knowledge and experience I have of matters affecting the officers and soldiers of the defence forces and because I have seen over a long period injustices such as I have mentioned already.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say that it would be too difficult to set them out in an Act.  That defence is gone because it has been set out for the last 30 years in an Act.  It is set out in the British Army Act, so that there is no difficulty in prescribing it here.  Here there is no difficulty, and where it is so important why cannot the Minister agree to do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, and most Deputies in the House know, that where you have a disgruntled Army, a dissatisfied Army, the nation is not getting from it&mdash;and cannot expect to get from it&mdash;the service that the nation is entitled to expect to receive from an Army.  If there is to be a continuation of this pin-pricking of officers and soldiers in regard to their pay and allowances there would be nothing but irritation, dissatisfaction and grousing from one end of the Army to the other. We can here altogether, Minister and Deputies&mdash;and Senators when the Bill reaches the Seanad&mdash;make sure that there will be no possibility whatsoever of the state of affairs developing that I visualise developing and which must inevitably develop if the section in its present form is passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the trouble and the expense he has in trying to recruit a sufficient number of soldiers for the Army.  The Minister knows that a very little matter of dissatisfaction can cause 20, 30, 50 or 100 soldiers in a unit when their term of service expires to refuse to take on for a further period.  The Minister knows that every soldier who leaves the Army dissatisfied <Col N="310" /> is an enemy of recruiting for the Army: that when he goes home to his local area and participates with his local football or hurling club, or goes into the local public-house at night to have a drink and meets his boy friends on social occasions or in the course of work or business, that man, if he leaves the Army dissatisfied, will be sufficient to prevent a whole area from having anything to do with the Army.  If from every part of the country you have men leaving and saying that their pay can be taken away from them by regulations made by the Minister, by interpretations placed on those regulations by officials who have not the broad view that a Parliament ought to have in regard to matters of this kind, then we find a whole general feeling and tendency against the Army and against the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There was a time when even the pay of an ordinary tradesman and worker was interfered with by their employers. Deductions were made for this, that or the other and it required Parliament by an Act to prevent any deductions being made from the pay of the ordinary worker.  Now, if that is the case in regard to the ordinary workers so much more so should it be the case in regard to soldiers who receive a considerable amount of their emoluments in kind, either in food, clothing or accommodation, and who only receive portion of their emoluments in cash.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured not, I would say, in the briefest manner possible, but I have endeavoured to picture to this House the state of affairs that will result if the new idea in this new Bill is adopted and if we throw overboard the protective sections that we had in the old Act.  If I could see any reason for this, any genuine or valid reason, obviously I could not be so strong in my objection to it, but I see no valid reason.  I can see the reverse, a departmental desire to get control of the souls and bodies of the men who serve the State in arms.  That is what I object to.  The Minister may say, as he has said on other sections and as has been said previously, that the regulations that he makes will be laid before this House.  I do not want to repeat what I said many times in the <Col N="311" /> House that that is no use, that when the Minister has made a regulation it is impossible for the Dáil to change it.  I do not think I ever knew of a case where Dáil Éireann defeated or annulled a regulation placed before it by the Minister or a Government.  If it did, it would be tantamount to saying to the Government: &ldquo;Resign.&rdquo; The position we are then in is this&mdash; that Deputies who would support the Government and who wanted to keep the Government in office might feel that a matter of soldier's pay was not the issue on which they would vote against the Government, bring about a dissolution of the Dáil and a general election.  I say that, no matter what Government happens to be in power. So that there is no protection there.</P>
    <P>Anything the Minister may want to do he can do in that regulation.  The trouble is that if it is found in practice a regulation made reacts too favourably on behalf of an individual or a group of individuals, then an amending regulation will be brought in in the simple machinery of amendment before each House and by a simple vote adopted, whereas if there was to be an amendment of the Act in regard to pay or allowances, then the Bill introducing that amendment would have to go through all its stages in this House and in the Seanad.  It would be subject to amendment and there would be many opportunities of pointing out to and impressing on the Minister, both in this House and the Seanad, that the proposed amendment might not be desirable.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I look on this as the most serious part of the Bill before the House.  I have in regard to it a feeling of helplessness. I know the Minister is going wrong, that he is doing wrong in introducing this machinery to deal with pay.  I know that but the difficulty is to convince the Minister that he is so doing. If the Minister would say to me: &ldquo;Very well, I accept your amendments. I will agree to reinstate the provisions in the old Act to which no objection is taken and I will introduce an amendment to deal with the principle of the one sub-section to which objection is <Col N="312" /> taken and we can debate that in the House,&rdquo; then I think that this Bill could be law in a reasonably short time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is adamant in sticking to this idea of regulations; if the Minister is adamant, notwithstanding what experience says, in going to provide that he or whoever may succeed him may deal with forfeitures, deductions and stoppages, then I think it were better for the Defence Forces that this Bill was never introduced.</P>
    <P>I spoke at some length on this matter and I did so because I am concerned very seriously about it.  There are thousands of soldiers concerned. Soldiers who serve now and who will serve in the future under this Bill are all concerned with it.  The military profession which had its safeguards and which has been built up in this country as something to be proud of is going to be affected by this.  I should only hope that the Minister would see the sense of the proposition I am making, that he would see the sense of the submissions I am making and the wisdom of my appeals.  If he did, I am perfectly certain he would agree with the amendments I have moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to say that the Minister's advisers are the hobgoblins of Deputy Cowan's mind.  They appear to haunt him in his waking hours.  I do not know what they may do in his sleeping hours but certainly since this debate began he has made it very clear to me and to any of the other members of the House who were listening to him throughout this resumed debate, that that is so.  He is not paying much of a compliment to me&mdash;I am not looking for compliments&mdash;and he is not paying many compliments to the people who might succeed me when he assumes, as he assumed throughout this debate, that everything in this Bill was done by civilian authorities and that the Minister, so far as he exists at all, exists only in the form of a rubber stamp or something equivalent to that. I have come to realise that there is no Defence Bill that I or any other Minister for Defence could bring in which would satisfy Deputy Cowan.</P>

    <Col N="313" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only Bill that would satisfy Deputy Cowan is Deputy Cowan's Bill and until he can get into my position or the position of my predecessors he will have to be satisfied with what is brought in by the Minister who is here.</P>
      <P>This Bill was brought in by my predecessors. It did not get very far and we did not have an opportunity of discussing it beyond the Second Stage. It was altered in many respects since then.  It was altered in Committee.  I think that Deputy Cowan himself will have to admit that many of the points which he made in respect of this Bill and many of the propositions which he put forward were met by me in ministerial amendments.  They were met merely by reason of the fact that I myself was satisfied with the case the Deputy made.  It was on my instructions that the Minister's advisers got down to preparing the amendments in draft form and as far as the Minister's advisers are concerned they will merely carry out the instructions the Minister gives them.  It does not matter a button to them whether the Minister accepts their viewpoint or not.  That is his responsibility and he will have to accept whatever may occur as a result of his decision.  The Minister's advisers will not have any cause to worry because of what may occur in consequence of that.</P>
      <P>I only say that because I think the Deputy is obsessed by the belief that there is in the Department of Defence some kind of coterie, clique or group of individuals who are at war with the members of the Army, and especially at war with the rank and file of the Army.  Such, of course, is not the case.  The men who are dealing with this matter are just as human as Deputy Cowan or any other Deputy and would be just as anxious to do justice to the men of the Army as any member of this House would be, including Deputy Cowan.  Why he singles out these individuals for that kind of treatment I find it difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan seems to have the impression <Col N="314" /> that the Army knows nothing whatever about what is going on, that these regulations and these sections in Bills are being inflicted upon them without any knowledge whatever on their part.  The Defence Bill was referred specifically to the military branches at the various stages in its preparation and drafting.  It has been submitted about five times since 1949. It has been continually under examination in those branches and proposals for amendment have been put forward from time to time.  A set of printed debates of the Dáil Special Committee was sent to the Adjutant-General, who was requested to arrange for an examination of the debates by the military branches.  Copies of these debates were also circulated to the various military branches in the usual manner. The matters raised in the Special Committee debates were discussed between members of the military branches and the secretary's branch, and amendments proposed on the Report Stage of the Bill were agreed upon at these discussions.  There was no stage up to the present at which the military were not kept completely and fully aware of the course and trend of the debates on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan is not doing himself a service in exaggerating the case in the manner in which he appears to be doing.  He is not taking any account of the efforts I am making here, by the amendments which I, myself, am proposing, to meet some of the requirements in this case.  In amendment No. 51 (f), with which we will be dealing in due course, we are going out of our way to meet, to some extent, the requirements which Deputy Cowan suggests should be met.  We are there naming the headings under which these forfeitures, and so on, could be made.  Forfeitures of and deductions from the pay of Army personnel fall under two main headings.</P>
    <P>(a)  Non-penal Deductions&mdash;These are made to repay the State for articles or services provided.  Examples are, issues of food, clothing, etc., on repayment, rent, laundry and haircutting charges.  Deductions are also made to enable a portion of the <Col N="315" /> soldier's pay to be paid to his wife and, of course, amounts by which he has been overpaid are also deducted.</P>
    <P>(b)  Forfeitures and Penal Deductions.&mdash;These are penalties incurred because of some fault or omission on the part of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan does not in his amendment make any provision for the making of non-penal deductions, either in the Bill itself or by regulations to be made under it.  On that score alone his amendment cannot be accepted because it must be obvious that such day to day non-penal deductions must be made.  This is not, however, the main question at issue. The real issue is whether the circumstances in which forfeitures of and penal deductions from pay should occur should be provided for in detail in the Defence Bill itself or by regulations to be made under the Act in due course.  Deputy Cowan, in the course of his remarks, talked about the gravest forms of injustice which resulted from some of these penal deductions.  That, again, is a direct reflection on the Minister.  The Minister would have to be of the lazy type he describes, who would not be doing his business, who would be accepting everything that came before him and sign on the dotted line without any consideration as to what he was signing. I wonder if there is such a person.</P>

      <P>That is your viewpoint. It is not mine.  I have been responsible for the signing of numerous ministerial Orders over all the years in which I have had the honour to be Minister for Defence.  Every one of those ministerial Orders was generally in regard to some wanton type of damage that was caused by the individuals <Col N="316" /> against whom the Orders were made.  The report emanated from the source right down beside the event and graduated until it came to the Minister and the details were there, giving fact for fact in respect of the particular damage caused.  I do not know whether Deputy Cowan is implying that the officers, non-commissioned officers and the various people who had to make statements in respect of these things were telling falsehoods or not.  I am prepared to believe they were merely describing the facts and, if in my opinion the facts were such that the ministerial Order should be signed, I had no hesitation whatever in signing it.  I want to point that out in order to show that the Minister has responsibility in respect of these Orders. There were numerous occasions on which I made amendments to these Orders, where a sum of money, perhaps a reasonably large sum when you come to relate it to a private soldier&mdash; £5 or something like that&mdash;might have been involved.  Where, in my opinion, the fine was too heavy, I had not the slightest hesitation in reducing it&mdash; when, after having read the evidence submitted to me, I was satisfied the fine was too heavy.  On numerous occasions I had no hesitation whatever in removing it completely and entirely.</P>
      <P>I want to impress upon Deputy Cowan especially, and also on the members of the House who have been listening to Deputy Cowan, that the position is far removed from what the Deputy himself has been suggesting it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to change over completely to the regulations system was taken by one of my predecessors in 1949.  While the decision was based mainly on administrative considerations there are ample precedents for dealing with such matters by regulations rather than in legislation.  In this country, for example, forfeitures and penal deductions in the case of the Garda Síochána are dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Justice (with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance) under Section 12 (1) of the Police Force Amalgamation Act, 1925.  The British, in spite of having these provisions in their <Col N="317" /> Army Act, deal by regulations with forfeitures and deductions in the case of the Navy.  So they are not wedded to that system any more than we are. That this procedure is now the modern trend in other countries is indicated by the fact that the Canadians adopted the regulations system in their National Defence Act of 1950.  I made that clear at our discussions during the Special Committee debates.  I do not think I impressed Deputy Cowan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not convince me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Deputy had some idea that there was some sinister influence in the Department of Defence.  I think that, on that occasion, he actually named or almost named that person, but, again, I think he was wrong and that he was allowing that idea which he has that there is always some sinister influence at the back of these things, to influence him in his viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made in the Special Committee by Deputy Cowan that if these matters were dealt with by regulation the point of view of the Finance authorities would prevail and that variations would always be for the purpose of making it easier to effect deductions and stoppages.  It might be well to describe briefly the actual machinery by which regulations are made.  When the need for a new regulation arises a preliminary draft is submitted for approval to a regulations committee, consisting of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Deputy Adjutant-General, Deputy Quartermaster-General and two senior officials of the secretary's branch.  Deputy Cowan can see there that every section of the Army is getting an opportunity of investigating it.  If approved by the committee the regulation is then circulated individually to the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General.  If they approve it is submitted for signature by the Minister, and if it has financial implications, for signature also by the Minister for Finance.  While the ultimate decision to make a regulation rests with the Minister, therefore, it <Col N="318" /> will be seen that the military authorities have ample opportunity of expressing their disapproval if they consider a proposed regulation is unjust.</P>
    <P>The argument has also been advanced that the soldier's interests are better protected by having these matters dealt with in legislation.  It is difficult to believe that any Minister for Defence would ever attempt to worsen the soldier's position in regard to these matters without full justification. If, for any grave reason, it might be necessary to do so, it would be done irrespective of whether it would mean new legislation or an amending regulation.  I still feel that the regulations system is preferable from the point of view of flexible administration. I am, however, prepared to admit the desirability of providing in the Bill the maximum safeguards for the soldier consistent with the necessity for leaving matters of detail to be dealt with by regulation.  In my amendment, No. 51 (f), I propose, accordingly, to insert in the section the general headings under which regulations can be made governing forfeitures and deductions and also to include a provision limiting the rate of deduction. These limitations of the power to make regulations, together with the provision that all regulations governing these matters would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and be capable of annulment, in my opinion provide ample safeguards for the soldier.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Cowan is advocating that we should not penalise irresponsibilities.  I do not believe for a moment that he would stand over that sort of thing.  However, in the case he has been making, he has almost been suggesting that there should be no forfeiture, penal or otherwise. If a soldier who has charge of valuable State property, in the form of a motor-car or some other piece of equipment, damages that equipment through irresponsibility, through carelessness or through some other cause, and if it is proved to have been caused through negligence on his part, he should have to pay some part of the cost of that damage.  Here, I want to say also that the ministerial Orders <Col N="319" /> which deal with that type of damage never in any circumstances come near the actual cost of the damage proper. As far as my experience goes, the fine is infinitesimal in regard to the actual cost of the repairs of the particular type of machine damaged.  Therefore, from every possible point of view, I can give the House the assurance that the Army personnel examine every one of these regulations.  If they have any case to make against the form of a regulation, the Adjutant-General can see me about the matter.  He has audience with the Minister, at his own request, at any moment and, in fact, he interviews me several times during the day.  If he has any case to make against the form of a regulation he can come along and make his case as man to man.  When a case is made of such a character that I am satisfied it is a good one, naturally I have no hesitation in meeting him as far as it is possible to meet him.  I feel that every individual occupying that position would be quite prepared to do as I do. I have no hesitation in saying that at all.</P>
    <P>I have sufficient faith in my fellowmen to believe that, in these circumstances, there is hardly any individual who wants to go out deliberately to penalise another and I am pretty certain that no member of the Army wants to inflict unnecessary penalties on a fellow-soldier.  If they have a painful duty to perform they perform it and they do it honestly.  It is their duty to do that.  If it were otherwise, I wonder where we would get.  If a man, because of sentiment or for some other reason, decided that he would not make an unfavourable report when he knew it was his duty to do so, what sort of Army would we have or what sort of organisation would we have anywhere if that attitude were to be adopted?</P>
    <P>You must have complete confidence in the people who are dealing with these things.  It may be a painful duty but it is a duty which is carried out. In the main, these orders emanate from the source right up along and there are numerous people who can check, and who do check, as I can see from perusal of the files, and make alterations <Col N="320" /> and recommendations before the final recommendation reaches me.</P>
    <P>I would like if Deputy Cowan would meet me as far as is possible.  I do not want to force my views on him but I am satisfied from a thorough examination of this whole situation in respect to this particular section that we are not inflicting hardship on anyone. We are making regulations which will ensure as far as regulations can ensure through the section, and later through the regulations which will arise out of the section, that we will have that form of discipline in the Army which it is so necessary to preserve if we are to have an Army that is going to be of some credit to the nation.</P>

      <P>It is the same difficulty as the Minister is in, that this Bill was on the stocks, apparently, since 1949 and that this provision was in it in 1949.  I wanted to say first and foremost in regard to what the Minister says about a matter such as this that I do accept the position of ministerial responsibility and that it is the Minister who is responsible for everything he introduces or advocates and not his advisers.  I know that the Minister is undoubtedly responsible for the amendments which he moves and not his officials.  Naturally, I do not assume that everything that is done in the Department of Defence.  I know enough about the machinery there to know that that is not so.  I do take issue with the Minister when he says that I have to be satisfied with what he does.  I know that the Minister did not intend that in regard to the principle of parliamentary responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that but I know he did not intend that. Every Deputy is in the position that his responsibility in this House is to his constituents and to his conscience. If I thought that a wrong line was being adopted and if I were to say nothing about it I would be a very poor type of representative.  Parliamentary Government and constitutional responsibility owe a good deal to individuals who did not see eye to eye with everybody else and who maintained a particular point of view and fought for it at every angle.  It will be agreed that a considerable amount of constitutional progress and democratic development is due to the people who had that frame of mind and who were not afraid or unwilling to advocate what they thought was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of something the Minister said on Second Reading, I was very keen to find out who, in fact, in the Army considered this Bill.  The Minister has told us to-night that it was continually under attention in the military branches of the Department of Defence.  I had discussed this matter with many people who, I knew, had very sound views in regard to Army administration and I was very much surprised to find that they knew nothing about it except what they read in the newspapers.  I addressed a parliamentary question to the Minister asking whether particular named officers in particular appointments, like the officers in command of Commands, the officers in charge of the Military College, the officers in charge of particular corps, the various Command legal officers, the officer in charge of the Recruit Training Depot, officers in charge of battalions&mdash;the people that I would consider to be the practical, working officers of the Army&mdash;had at any stage been consulted or had given their advice in regard to this Bill.  On the consideration of ministerial responsibility, the question was ruled out of order.  In other words, I was not entitled to that information.  I was not entitled to obtain it by means of a parliamentary question.  Certainly, I would have been very anxious to know whether officers holding the <Col N="322" /> responsible appointments that I mentioned, had, in fact, been consulted and had, in fact, given their consent to the major alterations that are made by this Bill and particulrly by the section that is under discussion.</P>
    <P>I am assured now that the Bill was discussed by what I term the regulations committee of the Department of Defence, with representatives of the civilian side, and that they had agreed to this procedure&mdash;in other words, they had agreed that the procedure should be recommended to the Dáil.  That shows that there was some military consideration of the Bill, that there was some other consideration in regard to it and that there was some ministerial position.  The Minister says that at no time were the military not concerned with this Bill.  I assume that he means by that that the military authorities&mdash;I would certainly be anxious that should be on record&mdash;who are in fact the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant&mdash;General and the Quartermaster-General, have agreed to the alteration that the Minister proposes&mdash; in other words, that the heads of the Army have agreed that the statutory protection which exists in the old Act for officers and soldiers is to be thrown overboard and that in the future officers and soldiers are to be subject to regulations that are to be made by the Minister, with the consent, of course, of the Minister for Finance.  It certainly comes as a surprise to me to learn that those very senior officers of the Army would consent or agree to such an alteration in the military law governing pay and allowances.  If the Minister says that that is so, we have to accept that.  As I say, it comes as a surprise to me and will, I am sure, come as a greater surprise to the officers and the soldiers in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I take account of the efforts the Minister has made to meet proposals that I made in the Special Committee. I appreciate very much what the Minister has done to meet me.  My regret is that on what I consider to be very fundamental matters he has not advanced to the position that I advocated.  There was a matter which might have come under discussion here, in which it is proposed to provide <Col N="323" /> for the suspension of officers.  I was very pleased indeed when the Minister announced here this evening that the amendment I proposed, to delete that provision, was acceptable to him.  I take considerable pride in at least achieving by my recommendation and by means of this amendment, the elimination from the Bill of that particular proviso.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the cases in which the Minister for Defence deals with what he terms the wanton type of damage.  He says that when that comes to his notice he would have no other course open to him as a person of responsibility than to order a particular officer or soldier guilty of that wanton type of damage to pay a certain sum in compensation.  Let us examine that just for a moment.  The Minister receives certain documents, a file in which there are certain reports which would indicate that a particular person was guilty of what he describes as a wanton type of damage; and in that case he orders&mdash;and, he says, properly orders&mdash;the forfeiture or penal reduction of a certain sum of money from the pay of the officer or soldier concerned.  We all know that when it is a matter of documents, documents are untrustworthy.  We all know that, even in cases of the gravest nature before the civilian courts, before the Central Criminal Court, depositions&mdash; in other words, statements of evidence made on oath&mdash;may clearly indicate that a person is guilty of a charge, but the trial of that matter, where that person is defended, may and very often does result in the acquittal of the person concerned.  In those cases, there is the sworn evidence of individuals on the depositions, and although they may appear to convince a person of responsibility that the accused in that case is guilty of a very grave offence, a jury trying the case in accordance with law may come to the conclusion that that person is not guilty of that offence at all.</P>
    <P>That is the major objection I have to penal deductions of that nature, made against officers and soldiers, by a Minister sitting in his office with nothing in front of him except a file of <Col N="324" /> reports which have not been subjected to any examination, to any test or to any cross-examination.  Obviously, there are very strong grounds for doubting the justice of any such procedure. That is why I had been looking forward for many years to the opportunity of amending that particular clause in the Act to provide that there would be some form of a judicial determination of the allegation against the officer or soldier concerned.  I find now that I am completely stymied by the new procedure adopted which gives the Minister power not only to deal with that particular matter but with every other matter relating to an officer's pay and allowances and to a soldier's pay and allowances, so that in the matter of what the Minister describes as a wanton type of damage the House can see that the Minister takes one approach and that I take another.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the approach that, if the papers submitted to him show that the person is guilty of wanton damage, he will order him to pay a certain sum in compensation.  My view is that, no matter what the papers say, the person concerned should have the opportunity of contesting that before some form of a judicial body which would have the right, after going into all the facts, to come to a proper conclusion on them.  I think the Minister will appreciate that, in taking the line I am taking, I am not obsessed with the belief that some group in the Department of Defence are out to do damage to members of the Army.  I am not obsessed with that idea, but I have a firm fixed idea in my own mind that a routine procedure over the years has been responsible for bringing about a state of mind in the Department of Defence that seeks out, first of all, for the means and the opportunity of mulcting somebody somewhere instead of looking the other way, of trying to dispose of any allegation of that kind against an officer or a soldier unless there is conclusive proof that it should be referred to some judicial body to examine it fully.</P>
    <P>That is the line that I take.  It is a line which is completely in conflict with the Minister's view.  The line that I <Col N="325" /> take is not taken for the reasons which the Minister suggests.  I take that line because of my experience over many years, as a person who, over the years, even since I ceased to be officially connected with the Defence Forces, has been asked for advice on matters of the kind which affect the pay of officers and soldiers.  I have had experience where attempts were made to deprive officers and soldiers of pay under the particular provision, and those attempts were discontinued when certain intimations were submitted to the Department, but the result afterwards was an amendment of the regulations to ensure that nobody in similar circumstances in the future would be able to escape by putting forward a legal defence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if I did not know of these things I might not be as strong in my opposition to what is now proposed, although the Minister and the House will agree that on every occasion since I became a member of this House on which it was proposed to deal by regulations with matters that in my view should be dealt with in the statute, I have always opposed that.  It did not matter what Minister introduced it, or what Government it was that introduced it, I have opposed the provision of regulations where the matter could be set out quite easily in the statute.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he has ample precedents for what he is doing.  His first precedent is the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act of 1926.  I ask any Deputy, could a more unfortunate example be put forward in this House as a precedent than that?  I would ask anyone who would like to enjoy himself for an hour to take that Act and look at the disciplinary provisions that are in it.  Some deal with the most amusing offences.  Tippling, I think, is one of them.  I have had on one occasion in this House to bring to the notice of the then Minister for Justice the case of a sergeant who was charged under that particular Act with neglect of duty.  I forget the other words which follow in the section, but he was charged with neglect of duty because he had brought no charge against anybody within the preceeding 12 months.  I had to draw <Col N="326" /> the Minister's attention to that some years ago, and that is to be brought forward by the Army authorities as a precedent.  I thought that the Army was above that, and that our conceptions of justice were above the conceptions that are in that Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act of 1926.  I have never read a more crude statute than that, and I certainly never thought that I would live to see the day on which anything that is in that statute would be brought forward as a precedent for the Defence Forces.  I think that the Minister's advisers could have given him a better precedent than that.  Then I am told that there is something in the British Navy about regulations.  I do not know.  I have to admit that I have not, in my perambulations, got into navy law.  I do not think that the Army here should have got into navy law either.</P>
    <P>Then I am told there is another example&mdash;the Canadians adopted it in 1950.  I should like to study the Canadian Act prior to 1950 and the 1950 Act; but obviously, what relates to Canada cannot, without the most thorough examination, not only of the statutes but of the history of their Defence Forces, be accepted as being properly applicable here.  I know nothing now about the Canadian Defence Forces.  I remember some years ago when it was part of my functions to study the organisation and training methods of the armies of the countries then known as the countries of the British Commonwealth.  It was part of my official duty to do that, but at the time I did not probe into the laws governing these Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>When dealing with a matter of this consequence, it is not sufficient to say to the House that the Canadians adopted it in 1950.  It should be the duty of the Minister to say: &ldquo;This was the position in Canada prior to 1950. This is the precise thing they adopted in the 1950 Act and they adopted it for these reasons&rdquo; and the reasons should be set out.  I do not think the Minister convinced the House when he kept his precedents to the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, some parts of the law applicable to the British Navy and to what the Canadians did in 1950.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> The Minister says it brings about more flexibility.  What does that phrase, &ldquo;more flexibility&rdquo;, mean?  Is it flexibility in favour of the soldier or officer or against him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I want to make on that is that if this country was governed by flexible laws, we would be in a very funny position. I know of no country that is governed by flexible laws&mdash;certainly no democratic or civilised country.  Laws cannot be flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they are made flexible by amending legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The inflexibility is somewhat altered by amending legislation but they are still inflexible. Laws must be inflexible. Everybody must know what the law is and nobody can take the line that the law is this now and that to-morrow, or that it is this because you have so much money and that because you have not so much money.  The law must be very clear, specific and distinct and there can be no flexibility about it.  There can be no flexibility which suggests that the rights of the officer or soldier to his pay can be interfered with.  I know the Department of Defence wants flexibility so that it will be flexed to suit their own conceptions of what the soldier or officer should be subjected to.  Deputy MacEoin suggested something on the same lines&mdash;that it brought about simplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference. The Minister wants flexibility and Deputy MacEoin wants simplicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is my difficulty. I am not concerned about flexibility, nor am I concerned much <Col N="328" /> about simplicity, but I am concerned about justice and that is the basis on which the matter should be discussed by the House&mdash;justice to the soldier and to the officer.  The only way we can have justice is by having inflexible provisions in the Act that his pay cannot be interfered with, unless a, b, c, d or e.  If the Minister wants flexibility, he is getting it in the section and I do not think it is right that he should get flexibility.</P>
      <P>He says that I am unduly apprehensive of the power of the Department of Finance to prevail in these matters.  If the Minister had a sense of humour in dealing with this matter, I could deal with it in a humorous way, but the Department of Finance will prevail, if it can, over everybody, and every regulation that is going to be made under this must be submitted to that Department for approval and must be approved by it.  I should like to think that the Department of Finance, not only in this but in other countries, is a human institution, concerned with the rights of individuals, but I have yet to find that that is so. The Department of Finance will be concerned with one thing only: how much money will they be able to save for the Exchequer by extracting it from the soldier's pay or allowances or otherwise?  Is it not a pity, when we, as a House, could deal with this matter, that we are going to leave it to two Ministers of the future to decide what they will do about it? That is what we are doing and the Minister is inclined to blame me for objecting to that.  That is what I am trying to protect.  The Minister has told us how the regulations committee in the Department of Defence operates.  I should say that I have some little knowledge of that matter, personal knowledge and experience as a member for a considerable period of that particular committee.  I know how it works.  It might be better for me if I did not know how it works, but I do, and I know the machinery which the Minister has mentioned here as operating in the Department of Defence in regard to regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one little experience I like to remember in regard to regulations. I remember having responsibility one <Col N="329" /> time of drafting a regulation dealing with Army holidays.  I drafted it.  It is still in operation; but included in it was a little paragraph which said that the Army was entitled to have a holiday on a statutory holiday.  It looked rather innocuous but is passed and it was not long out until the 1st January came and we were able to indicate round about that it was an Army holiday and no military people turned in for work on that 1st January. The Minister did, and the civil servants turned in; and I remember being called on the following day in order to make an amendment to the regulation deleting that provision.  I have to admit that I placed the file with those instructions in a drawer and they were forgotten and the Army holiday still exists.</P>
    <P>I mention that matter because being a matter of that kind it was overlooked, but it shows the simple way in which military or Defence Force regulations can be made; and it is because I know how these things can be made that I am reasonably apprehensive of giving the powers that are here in this Bill in regard to them.  I have seen other regulations that went through the procedure that the Minister mentions of all these people, printed, circulated, reached Cork, and there is a telephone message and an instruction to go and amend the regulations.  That is all right as far as discipline is concerned.  It does not matter very much as to whether you wear uniform before or after your tea. But it matters a terrible lot when one's pay and allowances can be interfered with in this fashion.  Deputy MacEoin says that it is a simple system.  Of course it is simple for the Minister to give an order to amend these regulations and when it is done to give another order to re-amend them, and of course it is perfectly flexible but there is no lifetime to the regulations.  These are what they want.</P>
    <P>Is it not strange that, flexible or inflexible, or simple or not so simple, the provisions of our Army Act of 1923, with the exception of one point to which I took exception, have lasted and have worked satisfactorily, and if they have done that why cannot we allow it to continue?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> I have before me the British Army Act as published in the latest edition, 1951, of the Manual of Military Law. I think it will be admitted that the British Army is a bigger army than ours, that it is rather more complicated and difficult, that Britain is a country in which they do try to bring matters in legislation up to date.  Britain is a country in which they have provided for soldiers convicted by court-martial a right of appeal to the Central Criminal Court in England, a thing I have strongly advocated for this Bill which the Minister would not accept. They have done that in the last few years, to give the soldier that right of appeal against a legal defect in his trial.  As big as the British Army was and is, wide scattered as its barracks may be, every soldier knows that if he is court-martialled and convicted and if there is a legal ground for objection to the decision he may in the circumstances set out in the particular Act appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and have his appeal heard on ground of law.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to adopt the Canadian system so long as it gives a chance of taking pay away from soldiers, but we will not adopt a system that gives the soldier a right of appeal against an illegal conviction.  I have here, as I say, the Manual of Military Law, 1951, Part I and it sets out precisely the grounds on which the pay of an officer may be interfered with, the grounds on which it is to be forfeited, the grounds on which penal deductions are to be made. It starts off by saying as a specific right of the soldier that the pay of an officer or soldier of the regular forces shall be paid without any deduction other than a deduction authorised by this or any other Act or by any Royal Warrant for the time being.</P>

      <P>No.  I do not want at this time to enter into that with Deputy MacEoin.  The Royal Warrant in its application to pay is subject to the provisions of this Act.  One can misread very easily legal phraseology. <Col N="331" /> It says very specifically as I read out in the beginning in regard to our own Act that the following penal deductions may be made from the ordinary pay due to an officer of the regular forces&mdash;and I am not going to read them all.  But it starts off exactly as our Act of 1923 did&mdash;from ordinary pay due to an officer who absents himself without leave or overstays the period for which leave of absence has been granted may unless a satisfactory explanation has been given through the commanding officer of such offence and has been approved by the Army Council.  There is considerable protection there in regard to the overstaying of leave.</P>
      <P>There are 15 sub-sections which set out clearly the laws that govern penal deductions from pay and allowances, and that with all the enormous statute roll that the British Parliament has, to put it that way; but we want flexibility, simplicity.  Similarly in regard to the soldier the same provisions are there.  Why do they have that in Britain?  Can anyone imagine in the British Parliament a Secretary of State for War daring to bring in an amendment to that provision to enable the Secretary of State for War, or anybody else, to make regulations to interfere with the pay of officers and soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, true that a very large number of members of the British Parliament have been, and some of them still are, members of the British Army.  It is quite true that they have had the experience of many wars.  In the last 40 years they have had the experience of two world wars and it is true that in Britain there has been raised up through the medium of regimental codes of honour an understanding of the things that matter to the soldier.  But there is more in it than that.  Anyone who studies the history of the British Parliament over the last 700 years and studies the constitutional developments, and the checks now and again to that development, the battles fought by individuals, some of whom were placed in the Tower and some of whom were executed, knows <Col N="332" /> that all the time one principle has been involved and that is the principle of the supremacy of Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is not without significance that so far as the British Army is concerned they have got that code in relation to their pay at all times, although I am perfectly certain that there are civil servants in the British Civil Service who may be anxious to alter it.  It is there, and I prefer to use that as a precedent rather than adopt the precedent the Minister has adopted here, the precedent of the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, the precedent of the British Navy and the precedent of what the Canadians did in 1950.  Above all, I prefer the precedent of our own Act, an Act that has survived for 31 years.  Why, if its foundations in this particular section are sound, should it be pulled down now?  Why should it be pulled down about the ears of the Minister, about the ears of his Department and about the ears of the Defence Forces generally?  I certainly do not know why that should be and I ask the Minister to give the reasons for it.</P>

      <P>Why should we have a Bill at all?  That is as reasonable as the question the Deputy is asking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one has a satisfactory statute, why alter it?  That is the point I want to put.  If the law dealing with deductions and forfeitures is satisfactory, subject to one amendment, why must it all be blotted out?  I have said very clearly and specifically that it would be much better for the Defence Forces if this Bill was never passed rather than have it passed containing its present provisions.  That is why I have decided to examine every section, clause and comma in this Bill so that the Minister and his advisers may on reflection, and before it becomes law, be convinced that after all there is no reason for this chopping and changing based on such unsatisfactory and unreliable precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that in a matter of such profound importance the Minister has not the benefit of the views of more members of this House.  The Minister makes the point that irresponsibility must be penalised.  He goes further <Col N="333" /> and he says that if damage is caused through irresponsibility, carelessness or negligence the person responsible must be compelled to pay.  That raises very difficult issues because we are again concerned with the phraseology. What does the Minister mean by irresponsibility? What does it connote? Does it connote wilfulness?  Does it connote carelessness which does not amount to negligence?  Is it negligence? If it is negligence, it is a breach of law and, if it is a breach of law, there are provisions in this Act to deal with it.  There are provisions for investigating breaches of law.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the result of our examination of this Bill would be that negligence of the kind the Minister has in mind&mdash;that is, negligence that constitutes an offence against the Defence Forces Act and possibly an offence against ordinary civilian statutes&mdash;would be dealt with as an offence properly investigated, properly considered and properly determined by a court-martial or other judicial body set up under the Act.  Our difficulty is in regard to these penal deductions: &ldquo;The sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public property which after due investigation appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.&rdquo; That is what the law says at the moment.  The law says nothing about irresponsibility; it says nothing about carelessness.  It very clearly says that he can only be compelled to pay if it is due to a wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.</P>
    <P>That is what I feel has been the trouble, that there are two types of construction, two types of interpretation of that particular sub-section. There is the legal construction that it must be proved that it was a wrongful act or that it was due to negligence and there is the interpretation which says: &ldquo;It was due to carelessness or irresponsibility and therefore I will make the person pay.&rdquo;  That is the matter which has been obsessing the minds of officers and soldiers for many years, that their cases should be dealt with under that sub-section by the Minister for a wrongful act or negligence, <Col N="334" /> and that the Minister has been advised frequently to make deductions based on what he calls irresponsibility or carelessness.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of the saying that words mean what we intend them to mean.  If the Minister says that he used the words &ldquo;irresponsibility or carelessness&rdquo; through inadvertence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that at all.  I am not apologising for anything I said.  The Deputy is trying to parse them and put other meanings on the words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  I want to put this to the Minister.  I just took down a very short note as he was speaking and I took down this, that he must penalise irresponsibility. That was a very serious statement for the Minister to make because the Minister has no right at law to penalise, as he says, irresponsibility by taking money out of their pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not admitted that I penalised anybody for irresponsibility. I am saying now that I penalised them in accordance with the law, whatever it was.  If I used the word irresponsibility I used it as my own description, although I am not apologising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to apologise, but we are dealing with a sub-section in which it is clearly laid down that money may only be deducted when the loss or damage or destruction is due to a wrongful act or negligence.  I instanced to-night a case where an officer has been asked to show cause why the Minister should not deduct from his pay a certain sum of money.  What right has anybody to write to an officer and ask him to show cause why the Minister should not deduct a sum of money from his pay when you have the very clear provision of that section that it is only after due investigation <Col N="335" /> by the Minister and when the Minister is satisfied that it was occasioned by a wrongful act or negligence that he can be called upon to pay anything?</P>
      <P>We have fallen into this position of irresponsibility, if I may use the word, where people are assuming to themselves and taking to themselves the responsibility of the Minister and writing to officers this warning note to show cause why the money should not be taken from them.  We have a precedent in this country and in Great Britain and in democratic countries generally of a principle of law that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  The procedure that has grown up here is to ask a man to prove his innocence, and officers and soldiers are being asked under that section for many years to establish their innocence and, if they cannot establish their innocence, the money is taken out of their pay and allowances.  If that is the way that has been misinterpreted and misused, I say that I object to giving the wider provisions that are asked for in this section to the Minister: that he can decide what forfeiture, deductions and stoppages may be made from the pay, allowances, gratuities and grants of members of the Defence Forces.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I have endeavoured to meet Deputy Cowan by putting down an amendment,&rdquo; and here is the amendment that the Minister proposes to move subsequently in regard to these regulations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Regulations made under this sub-section shall not prescribe&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  forfeiture of pay except in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  absence on desertion or without leave,</P>
      <P>(II)  custody, imprisonment or detention,</P>
      <P>(III)  absence from duty on account of a disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence,</P>
      <P>(IV)  unclaimed amounts;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the Act which this is intended to supplant says in the case of an officer and similarly in the case of a soldier:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" />&ldquo;pay shall be automatically forfeited every day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Of absence on desertion or without leave.</P>
    <P>(b)  Whilst he is in custody on a charge for an offence resulting in a conviction by a Civil Court.</P>
    <P>(c)  Whilst he is in custody on a charge resulting in a conviction by court-martial unless the court-martial shall otherwise direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says he wants to make regulations for forfeiture except in respect of absence, custody, imprisonment or detention, absence from duty on account of disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence, unclaimed amount, and deductions from pay except in respect of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(I)  articles or services provided,</P>
    <P>(II)  marriage allotment,</P>
    <P>(III)  fines, penalties, damages, compensation or costs awarded,</P>
    <P>(IV)  public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed,</P>
    <P>(V)  public or service debt or disallowance,</P>
    <P>(VI)  unauthorised expenditure or commitment;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, take just for purposes of comparison one sub-section that is there: &ldquo;public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed.&rdquo;  The Minister may make regulations about that.  Of course, he may make regulations for irresponsibility.  He may make regulations for carelessness. He may make regulations for all the things that attempts have been made to make officers and soldiers amenable to by monetary deduction over many years.  But the law it is replacing said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sum required to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public property which, after due investigation appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> It does not require any great intelligence to show that there is a very substantial difference between what is there&mdash;although it was the defective section, the one I hoped would be amended&mdash;and what the Minister provides here.  I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister why he puts it in in that bald fashion that deductions may be made from officers or soldiers in respect of public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed. There is nothing to indicate there that in fact the person who may have caused the damage is the person who would be mulcted for doing it or whether a person who had knowledge of a deficiency, a loss or a destruction could be compelled to pay.</P>
    <P>I am not, as the Minister knows, just opposing this particular section for the purpose of opposing it.  I am opposing it on the very strong grounds that I set out in the Special Committee when we debated this matter, which I set out again here to-night in moving the amendment that I did move, and which I am setting out now in the reply I am making to the observations of the Minister in support of his own section.</P>
    <P>I think when all is said and done it boils down to this simple question: why does the Minister want to change a law that has been satisfactory, which has been specific and precise, which was clear and obvious to everybody in the Army, however well educated or ill-educated he might be?  Why does he want to do that and to put into the regulations anything that he and the Minister for Finance may chose to put in, in regard to pay and allowances and deductions from pay and allowances?  That is the question that is troubling me.  Why does he want to do it?  I have advanced the reason&mdash;that in my view difficulties have been found in collecting money from soldiers and officers from time to time and that when this Act is passed and when this section becomes law, that defence forces regulations relating to these deductions and stoppages will be published and within these regulations there will not be the protection that there ought to be.</P>
    <P>It is one significant thing about the law of this country that any citizen <Col N="338" /> ought to be entitled to go into the stationery office, or otherwise purchase for whatever price it is, the law of the country.  Then a person who would be interested in joining the Army could, if he so wished, read the Defence Bill and see that there were certain matters laid down, matters of protection in the Act, and he would know that nobody could interfere in these matters against him.  No person, be it a civil servant, the Minister for Finance, or even the Government, could interfere.  He would know that protection was given to him by his own Legislature.  He would know that if he had a friend who joined the British Army, that that friend had the same protection against interference with his pay or allowances in the British forces.  But now, nobody can say what the law will be in regard to deductions and forfeitures, because the law may be laid down in regulations to-day and may be altered or amended to-morrow.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters in respect to dress, discipline and in respect to general administration that I think are proper to be dealt with in regulations that may be altered from time to time as circumstances change but there cannot be, and ought not be, any alteration in the law relating to or governing the forfeiture or deductions in pay.  If that principle is accepted and if it only meant writing in a couple of pages into the Act of 1923 then it would be right and proper that those pages should be written into this new Bill.</P>
    <P>On the matter of size, the Minister has found it necessary to take up as much space in the new Bill empowering himself to make regulations as it was found necessary to insert in the old Bill governing the same matters. So that from Deputy MacEoin's point of view of simplicity&mdash;where is the simplicity?  I do agree that it does bring about flexibility, but if it takes exactly the same amount of space to write in this provision giving the Minister power to make regulations as it does to put in the specific matters themselves in the Act, then I think the Minister has no grounds whatsoever for insisting on the alterations that he is making here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> On these grounds, which are the main grounds in regard to this particular provision, I have felt it necessary to speak at greater length than I might have done and my reason for doing so is to endeavour by force of argument to convince the Minister that <Col N="340" /> he is making a mistake here.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
