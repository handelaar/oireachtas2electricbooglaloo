      <P>It is not possible to state the value of the weekly payments under the Workmen's Comsation Acts of 50/-, 62/-, 69/- and 76/- in terms of 1938 prices since an index number appropriate to the class concerned is not available.  From the official general index numbers it is estimated that £1 in mid-August, 1954, would have purchased at retail prices the same quantum of goods and services (including rent) as 8/7 at mid-August, 1938.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, by arrangement with the various trade unions, a double shift or an around-the-clock shift may be provided for in Rushbrooke dockyard, when the occasion warrants, and that, when necessary, additional skilled tradesmen are recruited from the Dublin and other dockyards, and, if so, if he will state the circumstances under which the <i>Irish Plane</i> has drydocked at West Hartlepool, where a 40-hour week only is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the <i>Irish Hazel</i>, which recently drydocked for repairs at Rotterdam, has carried a &ldquo;cement block&rdquo; for over a year resulting in the displacement of 20 tons of cargo, and, if so, if he will state why this repair was not effected in Rushbrooke dockyard, where the ship had twice previously drydocked for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together. <Col N="950" /> I will be prepared to grant an application under Section 35 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, for a shift work licence at Rushbrooke Dockyard if an application is made to me and the circumstances appear to warrant that course.</P>
      <P>I do not think I should go into the detailed explanations as to why the <i>Irish Plane</i> drydocked at West Hartlepool or why the <i>Irish Hazel</i> carried a cement block.  I understand that the diversion of the <i>Irish Plane</i> to Rushbrooke would have involved inordinate cost as well as loss of freight already contracted for and that the carrying of a cement block by the <i>Irish Hazel</i> was in accordance with the prudent and economical working of the ship. I am satisfied that Irish Shipping, Limited have due regard to the need for carrying out repairs at Irish dockyards as far as possible but to do so in all cases would involve the company in disproportionately heavy expenditure and would impair the company's ability to compete in the world shipping trade.</P>
      <P>I must also remind Deputies that though the original capital of Irish Shipping, Limited was subscribed by the Minister for Finance the company has always operated as a commercial undertaking and that information of the type sought in these questions would not be made available by other shipping companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister's attention has been directed to the fact that three of those ships have recently been repaired in foreign dockyards&mdash; and I wonder if the Minister has been told, as I have been told, that the repairs to the <i>Irish Plane</i> are so substantial that they will carry on the workers in employment almost up to the Christmas holiday period&mdash;would he urge on Irish Shipping, Limited, that they should have these ships repaired in Irish dockyards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered these questions in some detail because I thought by doing so it would help to take the beam of undesirable publicity off Irish Shipping, Limited, which ought to get a chance to conduct its business in accordance with prudent <Col N="951" /> and economical methods of management. In this particular case, I can say again, as I have said in other cases, that Irish Shipping, Limited, paid the losses of the Cork Dockyard Company and are most anxious, therefore, that there should be no loss in the Cork Dockyard Company.  Consequently, any repair work they can place with the Cork Dockyard Company is placed there.  It is to the advantage of Irish Shipping, Limited, that the Cork Dockyard Company should be financially solvent because they have to underwrite the losses&mdash; and they have been doing so.  However, it is not possible for Irish Shipping, Limited, to bring these ships from one end of the world to another merely for the sake of having them repaired by the Cork Dockyard Company.  These ships are tramping. They have a schedule of trips to make. If repairs are necessary to these ships at any time they have to be done in many cases away from Cork and away from Ireland (1) because, in many cases, it is the most economical way of doing it and (2) it enables them to fulfil their timetable to carry freight from other ports where they have engaged to pick up cargo.  In the particular case to which the Deputy refers, it was possible for the vessel to be repaired while the vessel was being unloaded.  As a result of having the work done under these conditions, it was possible to have the work in the case of the <i>Irish Plane</i> done in between four or five days whereas, if it had to be brought to Cork, it would have taken four or five weeks, with serious subsequent losses to Irish Shipping, Limited, if they were not able to take up the cargo which they had contracted to carry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that other nations, who have dockyards of their own, employ tugs to bring disabled ships to their dockyards and that they impose a levy if that is not done?  Would the Minister not further agree that Rushbrooke Dockyard are carrying a technical staff and, in consequence, they have to put on that price to the next contract in order to carry the staff?</P>

      <P>In the case of the <i>Irish Plane,</i> the Cork Dockyard Company furnished an estimate to do the job in between four and five weeks. It was possible, by having the work carried out in the manner indicated in my reply, to complete the work in four or five days.  If the company had not acted as it did in this particular case, it would have cost them an additional £5,000.</P>

      <P>A draft of a proposed Harbour Works Order was received from the Galway Harbour Commissioners on 6th May, 1954, but the Order cannot be made until the precise scope of the works to be carried out has been determined.  The harbour commissioners propose to seek tenders for the deepening of the commercial dock on two alternative bases.  They were informed, on 24th May, that it had been decided to defer further consideration of their application for a Harbour Works Order pending receipt of the two sets of tenders.  The relevant contract documents were submitted by the harbour commissioners on 26th August and are being examined departmentally.  This examination will shortly be completed and the harbour commissioners will then be in a position to seek tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has received a communication from the Slane Brick Company, Limited regarding its production and disposal of clayware pipes used in land drainage, and, if so, if he has any proposals under consideration which will enable the company to retain their staff in full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="954" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from manufacturers concerning disposal of stocks of clay drainage pipes.  The manufacture of clay drainage pipes is protected by means of a tariff of 75 per cent.  (50 per cent. preferential) and duty-free facilities are not provided.  I understand that drainage work under the land rehabilitation project is necessarily of a seasonal nature as ground conditions during the winter months restrict it very much and it is probable that, this year, the bad weather and the late harvest have caused the amount of drainage work to contract somewhat earlier than usual.  I have no doubt, however, that, as in previous seasons, the market will revive early in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 20 of the employees of this concern are now laid off and that in the very near future apparently the balance of the staff, 64 people in all, will be laid off also?  I understand it is a difficult business, when premises such as these close down, to resume the work again.  In view of the appeal that has been made to industrialists both in general and in particular to increase production, I would like to put it to the Minister to do everything he possibly can to enable this firm to continue in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing to do anything I possibly could in the matter, but it is not clear to me that it is possible, with the resources at my disposal, to do anything.  I have no funds which would enable me to purchase these pipes.  In any case, they do not represent any ancillary part of my Department.  As I have indicated in my reply, the manufacture of clay drainage pipes is protected by means of a tariff of 75 per cent. (50 per cent. preferential) and duty-free facilities are not provided for the importation of pipes.  It will be seen, therefore, that the company is very substantially protected in the Irish market.  It may have run into exceptional difficulties this year because of the bad weather. I shall be only too glad to consider any suggestion which the Deputy may make by which I can help the company, <Col N="955" /> but it is not easy to see in what field I can help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any foundation for the statement made in the first part of the question.  The position is that the purchase of pigs by bacon factories and pork exporters is on a freely competitive basis and the prices paid for the various weights of bacon pigs reflect the preference for lean bacon both on the home and export market.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, retail prices do not come within my province, but I would point out that they have been the subject of a recent inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body and are controlled by Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

As regards the remainder of the question, I can assure the Minister that some bacon factories, at any rate, are cashing in on the grading system and reaping a rich financial harvest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister a question.  He tells me he is not aware of the general dissatisfaction prevailing and I want to know from the Minister where he got that information, as undoubtedly every pig producer in this country is aware that general dissatisfaction prevails <Col N="966" /> amongst them?  I want a reply from the Minister now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the Deputy allows me to open my mouth I will reply.  The answer to the query is that there is a differentiation between the prices paid for fat pigs and for lean pigs at the factory and I think it is right for me to add at once that there ought to be such differentiation and that the longer we live the more our people must come to realise that there is no market at home or abroad for bacon produced from fat pigs and there is nothing I can do about it&mdash;or anybody else.  As regards the alleged failure on the part of curers to reproduce in the prices charged for bacon the prices they are paying for different categories of pigs, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that bacon recently is being offered on the basis of 300/- for the leanest, 296/- for lean, 280/- for prime and 274/- for stout. Whether that accurately represents the differential between fat and lean pigs taken into the factories I would not be prepared to state categorically but it does reflect some differentiation. Whether that differentiation is shown in the retail shop at the point where the customer is concerned is a matter which has been considered by the Prices Advisory Body and the retail Order for bacon has been adjusted in the light of their findings.  That does not come within my province and if it does not meet with the Deputy's approval I can only refer him to my very able colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The recent extension of the normal retiring ages by a further two years was granted to officers of all ranks with pre-Truce service as the existing extension of one year granted in 1949 was not considered to be an adequate recognition of the pre-Truce service rendered by these officers.  Only for that very exceptional and compelling reason was I prepared to disturb the normal retiring ages which were fixed after full consideration of all the factors affecting each rank.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that the extension granted to pre-Truce officers will cause some delay in promotions to commandant and higher ranks.  I have, however, the case of junior officers under special consideration with a view to seeing in what way their conditions of service may be improved. I am not yet in a position to say what the final outcome of such consideration will be.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to say, first of all, that neither my colleagues nor myself are opposed to this extension of service.  I am glad to hear that it goes below the ranks as mentioned in the question because I know, and the Minister knows, that there are pre-Truce officers in at least two of the lower ranks.  What I am concerned about is that there is a number of officers who will be concerned with this extension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,720 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the repayment to the Central Fund of sums advanced under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act (No. 5 of 1939, Section 10).</P>
      <P>In the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939, it was provided, where an advance is made under the Trade Loans Acts, or an advance made from Central Funds, that if the whole or part of the advance remains outstanding after two years it shall be repaid on the direction of the Minister for Finance out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is, therefore, necessary to ensure recoupment of an outstanding advance made by the Central Fund in the financial year ending March, 1952.  The annual account for the year ended March, 1952, indicated that an advance of £8,969 18s. 9d. was made by the Central Fund to fulfil a guarantee to <Col N="987" /> a firm.  Part of the advance, namely, £6,720, is now outstanding for over two years and it is necessary to provide for the repayment of that sum to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The facts of the case are briefly that a loan of £15,000 was guaranteed in July, 1951, to enable a firm known as Parlanti Castings (Ireland) Limited, Jamestown Road, Finglas, to acquire plant and machinery for scrap metal reclamation and refining, for moulds, laboratories, motor and stock. The company had to withdraw £8,880 out of the £15,000 guaranteed to them when, following considerable difficulties arising from the management of its affairs, it was compelled to go into voluntary liquidation. Under the terms of the trade loan guarantee a receiver was then appointed over the assets of the company but the proceeds of the assets were insufficient to meet the liabilities of the company in respect of the loan, plus interest amounting to £8,920.  To date, a sum of £2,250 has been received out of the realisation of the assets.  This amount has been repaid to the Central Fund, reducing the amount advanced to £6,720, which is the amount of the Estimate.  It is expected that some further amount of money will be realised but this further amount will be reduced by the fees and expenses of the receiver, which have not yet been paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been my experience that the Dáil has been unduly critical of these Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts failures.  I think the present Minister will have that experience also.  Nevertheless, when a company which has been assisted by a State guaranteed loan under these Acts fails, and the taxpayer is required to make good the extent of their failure, full details should be given to the Dáil.  I think that is particularly desirable in this case.  The Minister mentioned that this trade loan guarantee was given in July, 1951.  I was Minister for Industry and Commerce in July, 1951, but I take no responsibility whatever for the giving of the guarantee in this case.  It was given by my predecessor.  His decision had <Col N="988" /> been communicated to the company before I resumed office as Minister. The announcement of his intention to give the trade loan guarantee had been tabled in the Dáil before I resumed office as Minister.  Apparently, although I was not aware of it at that time, the formal sealing of the debenture bond had not been effected until after the change of Government, when I was Minister for a couple of weeks. In my view, from what I know of this particular case, a guarantee of a loan should not have been given.  There was little likelihood of this undertaking making good.  In fact, it went into voluntary liquidation within three months of receiving the trade loan guarantee.  I do not know, from recollection, whether the advisory committee under the Act recommended the giving of the guarantee in this case.  Normally, I would say the Minister should not answer that question. It is only an advisory committee. The responsibility for the decision rests on him.  However, there was, in this case, some suggestion of political pressure being used&mdash;I do not say successfully&mdash;to secure a favourable decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should be told how much private money was put into this undertaking. I do not think there was very much.  The bulk of the loss involved in this unsuccessful attempt to establish an industry falls upon the general taxpayer.  I have said already, and I repeat, that the percentage of failures in industrial projects which are assisted under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts is likely to be higher than in projects that do not require to avail themselves of that Act.  Any concern which can finance itself without availing of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts will do so.  It is only those projects which have for some reason difficulty in getting finance in the ordinary way&mdash;and that is generally due to some element of risk in the undertaking&mdash;that resort to these Acts.  It would be quite undesirable that we should be hypercritical of those failures particularly when there appears that there was at one time a reasonable prospect of success.  I suggest that in this case there never was a reasonable prospect of success. The fact that the company was out of <Col N="989" /> business three months after getting the loan supports that view.  I do not think we should let it through the House merely as a routine business. I think a full statement should be made on the set-up of the organisation, the financial participation in it by other people; we should be given some indication of the reasons why the guarantee was given and some fuller explanation of the causes of failure of the concern.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is serious in suggesting that we ought to have a fulldress debate this afternoon on the finances of the company in question. Frankly, I know nothing about it and I had nothing to do with the giving of the original loan.  I am merely discharging a statutory function imposed on me under the Act&mdash;that is, that when a sum of money is paid out under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts from the Central Fund, and has been outstanding for more than two years, there is an obligation under the Act of 1939 to have those outstanding moneys refunded to the Central Fund by means of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.

I do not want to conceal anything in this matter.  Whether or not it is desirable to do so in this or in other cases is a matter on which the Deputy should reflect.  I came across a case to-day of a trade loan guarantee which was given 12 months ago.  I think they have a <Col N="990" /> receiver in now.  That was a bit of bad luck.  I do not think that should diminish our faith in giving trade loans under that Act.  It may be a risk&mdash;in some cases, a calculated risk. It would be a mistake, however, if we were to churn up every one of these cases of failure here.  I am not sure it is the wisest line of policy in the long run, if we desire to serve the national interest.  If Deputy Lemass has any question that it is within my competence to answer, in accordance with parliamentary procedure, I shall be only too glad to answer him.</P>

The record shows that the percentage of failure is remarkably low having regard to the type of cases submitted for assistance under that Act.  I want to say that from what I know of this particular case, I would not have accepted the application.  I do not think the guarantee should have been given.  For that reason I think there should be on the record of the Dáil some statement of the facts of the case&mdash;a more complete statement than the Minister has given.  I do not know what induced my predecessor to give the decision in this case.  I am asking <Col N="991" /> now if he got a recommendation from the advisory committee.  Was he satisfied that the amount of private money put into this concern gave any prospect of success?  So far as I know, this firm got a State loan of £15,000 and, within a few months, went into volunatary liquidation.  I think that in this case the Dáil should be quite critical&mdash;and it should be equally critical no matter who is the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Solicitors Bill was initiated quite a long number of years ago by the Incorporated Law Society.  It has been, over those years, the subject of prolonged and detailed discussions between the representatives of the solicitors' profession, the Incorporated Law Society and successive Governments.  As a result of those detailed discussions and negotiations, I think I am entitled to say that a pretty substantial measure of agreement was arrived at between the last Government and the Incorporated Law Society.  As a result of further discussions that have gone on since the recent change of Government I <Col N="993" /> think I can say that complete agreement has been reached on a variety of topics and on the Bill as a whole between the present Government and the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these extensive discussions, the long period of time during which these discussions took place and the very substantial, if not indeed complete, measure of agreement that has been achieved, it is proper to describe this Bill as an agreed measure.  I appreciate, of course, that the Dáil and Seanad can make such amendments to this Bill as is thought proper or expedient in the public interest.  Nevertheless I do suggest to the Deputies that they should approach the consideration of this Bill in the frame of mind that those people who are intimately concerned with the profession have been given every opportunity of making their case and that successive Governments representing the public interest have, with a view to ensuring that the public interest would be adequately safeguarded, dealt with this matter in the way I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, it is quite clear, involves not merely the regulation of a learned profession but in very many respects it involves the public interest as well. Solicitors are not merely members of a learned profession acting for private clients or private interests.  They are officers of the court, they handle trust money, they handle the property of their clients and are the repositories of the secrets of their clients.  The general public interest requires from the members of that profession individually and from the profession as a whole high standards of efficiency, integrity and, above all, honesty. This Bill, therefore, comes as a public Bill in which it seeks to regulate the general affairs of the solicitors' profession and also to safeguard the public interest.  I think Deputies may rest assured that as far as the public interest is concerned the present Government, the last Government and previous Governments who handled this matter did everything possible to ensure that the public interest would be in every respect safeguarded.  A word of tribute is due to the representatives of the <Col N="994" /> solicitors' profession and the Incorporated Law Society for this Bill because while it may be described as the charter of the solicitors' profession, nevertheless it imposes upon solicitors, individually and collectively, far greater burdens than it provides easement for individual solicitors of the profession.</P>
    <P>The main objects of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies might be briefly restated.  They are: to repeal and re-enact, with modifications, the existing law as to solicitors; to enforce stricter discipline within the profession; to regulate professional practice and conduct; to make the profession more self-governing than it is at present; to require solicitors to keep proper accounts and to keep clients' moneys and trust moneys separate from their own; to establish a compensation fund out of which grants may be made to relieve or mitigate losses arising from the dishonesty of solicitors or their employees; to remit the stamp duty payable on the admission of solicitors and on their annual practising certificates, and to reduce the stamp duty payable by persons becoming apprenticed to solicitors.  It will be clear from that statement that the Bill enables the solicitors' profession to regulate their own domestic concerns, to provide, subject to certain safeguards, for all matters of discipline, for all matters of fees, for all matters dealing with the admission of solicitors, the education of solicitors' apprentices, and so on.</P>
    <P>Where public interest is involved or where the rights of individual citizens might be jeopardised by that particular body that is set up under the Bill, there is allowed an appeal to the Chief Justice, and where regulations are to be made where the public interest would be involved, the Chief Justice is interposed as the guardian of the public interest save in the case of the amount of the contribution that each solicitor is to pay towards the compensation fund that is to be set up under the Bill.  In that case, the Minister for Justice is inserted into the Bill to safeguard the interests of the <Col N="995" /> public and to see that the contribution that will be payable by solicitors under the Bill when it becomes law will not be reduced under the sum of £5.  I think the general idea of interposing the Chief Justice into this Bill between the solicitors' profession and the public is because of the fact that the Chief Justice has been, since the establishment of the State, really the judicial officer with the particular function of supervising certain activities of the solicitors' profession.  It is desirable at all events that the Chief Justice should be retained in his powers and functions in the manner and to the extent disclosed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go in any greater detail through this Bill.  An explanatory memorandum which has been supplied gives in very simple and comprehensive fashion an outline of the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill deals with the admission of solicitors, the discipline of solicitors, and also makes provision against unqualified persons practising as solicitors.  I think, however, the real interest from the public point of view in this measure must lie in the parts of the Bill&mdash;namely, Parts VII and VIII&mdash;and in the Fifth Schedule of the Bill, providing for the keeping of separate accounts by solicitors of their own moneys and moneys which they hold either in trust or on behalf of clients, and for the setting up of a compensation fund to provide some measure of indemnity, and ultimately a full measure of indemnity, for clients' losses caused through the defalcation or dishonesty of solicitors or their employees.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains details requiring regulations to be made with the concurrence of the Chief Justice providing for the opening and keeping by solicitors of accounts at banks for clients' moneys and for moneys of any trust of which the sole trustee is a solicitor or the trustees are a solicitor with partner clerk or servant of his or with more than one of such persons, and the keeping by solicitors of accounts containing particulars of clients' accounts and the keeping by <Col N="996" /> solicitors of accounts containing particulars of and information as to money received, held or paid by them for or on account of any trust of which the solicitor is sole trustee or the trustees are a solicitor with partner, clerk or servant of his or with more than one of such persons.</P>
    <P>It would be expected that in the normal course of events solicitors acting in a businesslike way would completely separate accounts of moneys which they receive from their clients, and keep them separately from moneys of their own and not use a bulk account containing a client's moneys which may come in mixed up with their own or perhaps using that composite fund as their own money. This is a measure in this Bill which I think will be of particular interest to the public and it is one that will require, what I believe all efficient and honest solicitors will welcome, that separate accounts can be kept in order that there should be less liability to defalcation on the part of the profession. The Bill also prohibits banks from setting off the amount of money that happens to be lodged in one account which is, in fact, a trust account or a client's account, against the liability of the client's own personal account.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill sets up the compensation fund.  I think I should again, perhaps, say at least a brief word of tribute to the solicitors' profession for their proposals in reference to this compensation fund.  As things stand at the moment, clients have no redress against a defaulting solicitor and unfortunately there have been perhaps too many cases of defalcations in recent years, but in order that their profession should stand well with the public and that it should be made apparent to the public that the profession requires the highest standards in professional integrity and honesty these proposals were made by the solicitors' profession themselves. Without these proposals there would be no remedy for clients.  The compensation fund which is being set up under this Bill will have to be built up over the years.  It is not the kind of fund that can be established straight away.  It is not the kind of fund that <Col N="997" /> could be made liable for perhaps all the defalcations, if all the solicitors were suddenly to go wrong&mdash;something which will not, in fact, happen.</P>
    <P>For the first five years it is proposed that there should be a fund established and financed from contributions by individual solicitors, such contribution amounting to in or around £5 a year and that for the first five years the solicitors' body itself acting through the Incorporated Law Society or whatever committee they set up under it, shall have full discretion as to the amounts that will be paid either in indemnity or part indemnity or by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payment towards indemnification of losses sustained by clients through defalcation or dishonesty of solicitors or their employees.</P>
    <P>After that period of five years, the object is to achieve a fund which will give complete indemnity to clients for defaulting solicitors and their employees except in the case where these defalcations are contributed to by the client himself by his negligence or otherwise.  That, I think, is a proper safeguard to put in because a client may possibly, knowing that a solicitor has defaulted on his funds, knowing perhaps that he has contributed by his own negligence, allow a solicitor to carry on as a solicitor inspiring a feeling of confidence in other clients and solicitors and members of the profession as well, and thereby cause other damage and loss which might be avoidable.  At all events, I stress the importance of this fund, which is one set up at the instance of the profession themselves. It is the scheme suggested by them and approved, with certain modifications, by the last Government and by the present Government.  It is the scheme that we recommend to the House, the scheme that will give something to the clients which they never had before and which will, taken in conjunction with the other provisions as to separate accounts, give the public confidence in the solicitors' profession and endeavour to raise and maintain the standard of professional conduct and integrity in the profession as a whole and in individual solicitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> There is one other matter that I think should be referred to.  Part X of the Bill provides for the abolition of certain stamp duties that were originally payable by solicitors and solicitors' apprentices.  The Minister for Finance is giving up the revenue that previously inured to the Exchequer from those stamp duties but, in return, the solicitors have given certain undertakings.  They have undertaken to prescribe such fees as will enable them to discharge without financial assistance from the State the duties imposed upon them by the Bill, to relieve the State of any financial responsibility to assist in the production of students' textbooks and to contribute an additional £500 per annum to the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting towards the cost of printing and publishing the Irish law reports.  Moreover, individual solicitors will have to pay an annual contribution of £5 to the compensation fund which is being set up, and when the fund commences to provide full indemnity they may be asked to pay a further £5 in any year in which this is necessary to secure the financial stability of the fund.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the stamp duties which up to now have been collected by the State should be applied so as to enable the society to meet the heavy burden they are now undertaking.</P>
    <P>I think it is proper that that statement should be made for the guidance of whatever authority hereafter has the duty of fixing or reviewing the amounts of any of the fees that may be charged in pursuance of the Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to stress through this House the desirability of this Bill becoming law before the 6th January next.  The Bill proposes that on that date the compensation fund will be established and that solicitors will send their annual contributions to the fund along with their applications for practising certificates in respect of the coming practice year which commences on that date.  If the Bill is not enacted by that time, the establishment of the fund would, as <Col N="999" /> the law stands, be delayed until the next practice year comes round.</P>
    <P>I think, and I want to emphasise again, that it is very desirable in the public interest that this Bill should be enacted on the date that I have mentioned in order that that compensation fund may be set up and be available at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I think that it is justifiable for me to say that the general principles of this Bill are such as are acceptable to all Parties in this House and accordingly I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the Incorporated Law Society should be paid this tribute for their public spirit in introducing these proposals.  It must be 12 years ago&mdash; I happened to be Minister for Justice at the time&mdash;that they brought in a private Bill.  I thought that was a long time but I was speaking to some of them recently and they told me that the 1898 Bill took about 14 years, so we were not worse than they were 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to take over the Bill in the public interest there were provisions in the Bill of which they did not approve. They were not very important.  One was a proposal for compulsory membership and as there were 80 per cent. or more of the solicitors in the society we did not see any reason why they should have that provision and the solicitors agreed not to proceed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the compensation fund, we thought there should be a bond. There was no mention of compensation in the beginning.  I do not suppose I am doing the solicitors an injustice by mentioning that.  It would be rather too much to expect of them that they would include it in their Bill.  When we took over the Bill we suggested a bond.  They had very strong objections to that and they convinced me that their objections were sound and that the scheme that they suggested as an alternative was a better one.  Our Government was satisfied that that was so.  The more I look into it and <Col N="1000" /> the more I hear the case made for a compensation fund as against a bond the more satisfied I am that they were right in that.</P>
    <P>The solicitors certainly have to be congratulated on bringing in the proposal to keep the accounts of their clients and their own accounts separate.  When I was Minister for Lands I had the experience of a farmer who owed land annuities and asked for time to pay until the next fair.  Fair day came along; his cattle were sold and the salesman, I believe in good faith, gave him a cheque for the amount.  The farmer lodged the money in the bank and the bank closed on the money and the farmer had to wait until the salesman was able to get the money to repay him.  I am glad that that cannot happen under this Bill.  Section 68 safeguards that position, and if a solicitor's personal account is overdrawn, that is his look out and the bank cannot interfere with the client's money.  That is a very good thing, and it was the solicitors who were responsible for bringing in that proposal.  They will make regulations that these accounts are to be kept separately and I have no doubt that they will be able to enforce that provision effectively.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given a very full account of the Bill.  As far as our Party are concerned, they are agreed that the Bill should be passed and that it should be law in time so that a year will not be lost.  I understand that if the Bill is not passed by 6th January, a whole year will be lost. This Party are prepared to facilitate the enactment of the Bill.  The Bill could be described as a Committee Stage Bill but there have been so many amendments to the original proposals that personally I cannot see very much need for many more.  Other members of the Party may think there are small points that need to be cleared up.  I think that will be all, as far as I can see.  I am glad to welcome this Bill.  I hope it will be a very successful one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Incorporated Law Society and the <Col N="1001" /> successive Governments responsible for promoting it during the past 12 years. I should like to congratulate them for having at last brought the Bill to a stage where it can become law.  I think everybody will agree&mdash;members of the public as well as the legal profession&mdash; that such a measure is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>There are just two small matters that probably would be better raised on the Committee Stage but which I should like very much to mention now so that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice might consider them.  One of the points in regard to Section 12 is extremely small.  Section 12 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a registrar of deaths shall, where an entry is made in the register of deaths concerning a person whose name is on the roll, forthwith send by post to the registrar a certified copy of the entry, and may charge the cost of the certificate and of the sending thereof to the registrar as an expense of his office as registrar of deaths&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In practice that might be a rather difficult onus on the registrar of deaths who might not have an opportunity of knowing whether a man is a solicitor or not.  Some other method might be adopted.  There is always the difficulty of a registrar of deaths ascertaining the occupation of all the persons whose deaths occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter is a more substantial one.  It is in regard to Section 54 which deals with the qualifications necessary for a person to act as a solicitor.  Sub-section (2) provides firstly that the name of the solicitor is on the roll; secondly, that he does not stand suspended from practice; and lastly that either he is a Civil Service solicitor or that a practising certificate in respect of him is in force.  Then sub-section (3) defines what a Civil Service solicitor is for the purposes of the Bill.  I have not examined the Bill sufficiently thoroughly to satisfy myself as to the effect of dispensing with the necessity of the practising certificate in the case of the Civil Service solicitor.  If I am not mistaken I think a Civil Service solicitor is really a new innovation as <Col N="1002" /> regards solicitors.  All that a practising certificate imposes upon solicitors is to notify the registrar of the Incorporated Law Society from year to year that they are entitled to practise. Is it wise to dispense with those provisions in regard to a solicitor employed by the Civil Service?  What does the exemption from the necessity to have a practising certificate involve, as far as the Civil Service solicitor is concerned?</P>
    <P>I think that if it is an effort to exempt the Civil Service solicitor paying certain contributions to the Incorporated Law Society I could understand it, but is it wise to exempt a Civil Service solicitor from complying with the ordinary rules laid down for solicitors in the general way?  Will it be creating a different type of animal in the end?  Is there a necessity for doing that?  I do not want to criticise the Bill because, as I say, I have not studied the impact of this section sufficiently thoroughly, but I would ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to look into that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome and to support this Bill.  There may be some few modifications as it passes through the different stages, but I do not think there will be very many.  On the whole the Bill is a good one and it is quite clear, as the Taoiseach, Deputy Boland and other speakers have said, that the Incorporated Law Society who, one might say, have initiated the Bill, are to be complimented. They have gone to great trouble to produce a Bill which, I think, will pass through the House without many modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives power to set up a disciplinary committee with power to impose penalties, and it protects the rights not only of the solicitor but of other parties by giving the right of appeal to any aggrieved party to the Chief Justice.  That, I think, is desirable. It may sound extraordinary that the council of a profession should have such powers, but I think that without such a Bill as this at all the profession has, through the Incorporated Law Society, shown that it is a body <Col N="1003" /> capable of accepting responsibility in such matters, and of dealing impartially and justly through its present committee with all matters which come before it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that either the members of the profession or of the public need have any worry about this disciplinary committee.  In fact they can be assured from experience that it will be a very effective committee and that it will be for the good not only of the profession but of the public generally.  I also think that the power given under this Bill&mdash;in fact the obligation&mdash;to set up a compensation fund is going to be of great benefit to the profession and to its individual members.  It will give that essential thing, greater confidence, to the public, in the profession and in its individual members.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of things in the Bill about which one would like to talk but these, I expect, will be discussed in detail on the further stages of the Bill.  I intended at this stage merely to express my support and to welcome the Bill.  I think it is a measure which might have been introduced years ago but even now it is very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and agree with the other speakers that it is a measure which has been long overdue.  While I largely agree with the general principles enshrined in the Bill I should like to say that I feel sure its provisions will be welcomed by the members of the profession.  It is a Bill which will be dealt with at greater length on the Committee Stage.  Although it has been under consideration, as the Taoiseach has said, for 12 years, the profession itself has had very short opportunity of considering it.  This very week a number of meetings are being held by a number of branches of the society and we hope they will have an opportunity of considering all its implications and that the Bill will be in force, as the Taoiseach requests, by the 6th January next. The principles underlying this measure have been discussed over a number of <Col N="1004" /> years but it is only since the circulation of the Bill a couple of weeks ago that people had an opportunity of considering the matter in detail.  Many of the principles in this Bill are already observed.  In the vast majority of cases, even in relation to accounts, a great number of practitioners, particularly those with any kind of extensive practice, have to keep separate accounts as otherwise they would never know where they are.  However, this provision for the keeping of separate accounts is welcomed by the vast majority of the profession.  I agree it is a very necessary provision.</P>
      <P>In connection with Part III, I do not think anybody has any objection to a solicitor being struck off the rolls for professional misconduct.  I would, however, ask the Taoiseach to consider the implications of Section 14, sub-section (1), (iii) (b), where it is provided that a solicitor convicted of treason or of a felony or misdemeanour or convicted outside the State of a crime or offence which would be a felony or misdemeanour if committed in the State may have his name struck off the rolls.  As the Taoiseach is aware, &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; covers practically anything, even a common technical assault.  Anybody who spends a penny on an innocent game of roulette is committing a misdemeanour.  Anybody who plays a game of pongo at a country carnival is committing a misdemeanour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Gaming Act he could be declared to be committing a misdemeanour.  Possibly the Taoiseach's answer will be that the disciplinary committee will be composed of reasonable men exercising their powers in a reasonable way.  I suggest that it is going very, very far to give such powers to such a body. We are in effect giving statutory powers to this committee.  That is going very far indeed.  The suggestion is made that if a misdemeanour is committed outside this State, something which would constitute a misdemeanour <Col N="1005" /> inside the State if it were committed inside the State, will be sufficient ground for removing a solicitor from the rolls.  That is something new in statutory law here.  How the Taoiseach would exercise his mind as to its constitutionality, or otherwise, is a question for the Taoiseach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with apprentices, I have no doubt that the provisions in this Bill are a re-enactment of the existing practice and I am sure these provisions have been discussed between the Department of Justice and the Incorporated Law Society.  Taking the term of four years, the major portion of that time is spent by the apprentice in a university taking out his degree. That prevents him from getting the practical knowledge so essential. Between this and the Committee Stage I suggest that this matter should be considered and the apprenticeship period should be extended to five years, the fifth year to be served with a master or firm of solicitors.  A graduate in law knows very little as a rule about the inside workings of a solicitor's office.  It is just as dangerous to let a final medical student loose on a man's stomach with a blunt hatchet as to let a final legal student loose in the State without any practical experience of the workings of a solicitor's office and with no knowledge of the difficulties he will encounter.  I think such a graduate should be compelled to spend one year after getting his technical qualifications in the office of his master or with a firm acquiring the practical knowledge so vitally essential in the interests of the public before he sets up on his own.  Many <Col N="1006" /> solicitors' apprentices realise at the present time that they lack the practical knowledge and experience to enable them to set up on their own and as a matter of course they take employment with a solicitor or firm of solicitors before they launch out on their own.  A medical graduate is required to serve a certain term in a hospital.  In the same way the legal graduate should be compelled to take a practical course before he is allowed to practise as a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride adverted to the position of Civil Service solicitors. Some of these solicitors take the view that they were formerly described as solicitors in the State service and they seem to think that if they are now defined as Civil Service solicitors they might in relation to some legal matter find themselves subject to a civil servant who is himself not a legal man. I do not know whether there is anything in that but, at all events, there is that view among some of them.  It is something that the Taoiseach might perhaps like to go into before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 65 deals with the right of audience for solicitors.  There is one suggestion which I have to make and I have solely in mind the question of Circuit Court appeals to the High Court.  A solicitor would not have the right of audience in the High Court. Quite often, in practice, it happens that, after an appeal is brought from the Circuit Court to the High Court on circuit, the parties settle whatever the cause of their action may have been.  A solicitor is not entitled to remain and have that settlement made a rule of court in the High Court on circuit without counsel.  I suggest that when the House is dealing with the question of the right of audience, it might be suitable on Section 65 to allow a right of audience at least for that purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rest of the Bill, in the main, I agree with practically every section of it.  Solicitors throughout the country will have from now until the Committee Stage to consider it.</P>
    <P>I see that, in its own way, the State <Col N="1007" /> is getting relief in respect of certain financial responsibilities under this Bill.  I have no doubt that the solicitors' profession as a whole will have to pay for the relieving of the State in that connection.  That is probably all to the good.  When the solicitors' profession is taking charge of its own affairs, naturally it will be expected to meet the resultant costs.  However, I should like to make it clear that it appears to me that the taxation on the profession as a whole as a result of this Bill will be greater than it was. I think the stamp duty that individual members of the profession formerly had to pay will be more.  I do not object to that.  I just mention it in case it may be suggested from some circles that there is relief in the whole taxation of the profession under this particular Bill.  I consider that it will work out to be much more than what it has been.</P>
    <P>I know that the provisions of this Bill, particularly as regards the compensation fund, will be widely welcomed by the profession itself.  It is rather strange that nobody suffers more than the body of solicitors as a whole if one individual solicitor goes wrong in any particular area.  The profession as a whole suffers very much over that. Under this provision, there will now be protection for the public.  My first impressions in regard to this Bill were that it would possibly be simpler if the situation were met by some other form of bond.  However, I am satisfied, after discussion with some of my colleagues, that this is a better way and that the profession as a whole will be responsible and will build up a fund that will take care of any person or any member of the public who may, through the depredations of a solicitor, lose financially.  Apart from the question of overcrowding in the profession &mdash;we all know there is no outlet in these parts, at any rate, for members of our profession&mdash;I think many of these cases are due to lack of experience. I would seriously urge on the Taoiseach to consider the suggestion I have made in connection with the training of solicitors' apprentices.  I will deal with any other matters <Col N="1008" /> arising out of this Bill on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will get full co-operation on the principles of this Bill.  We, on this side of the House, will do our utmost to ensure that the Bill will have a speedy passage so that the Taoiseach will be enabled to have it on the Statute Book in time for the 6th January, 1955.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  I should like, also, to say, from this side of the House, that I believe quite a lot of the work which was put into this Bill is a result of the work done by Deputy Boland in his capacity as Minister for Justice.  As some speakers have pointed out, it is practically 17 years to the day when legislation of this type was first suggested by the Incorporated Law Society.  The suggestion was first made at a meeting of that society on, I think, the 26th November, 1937.  At the request of the general society, the council of the society took the matter in hand and proceeded with the preparation of a Bill which was after some years, I think in 1943, submitted to the then Minister for Justice and his Department.  From that time on, there have been fairly close discussions and negotiations between the Department of Justice on the one hand and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society on the other hand.</P>
      <P>If there are two people in this House who have done most, in conjunction with the Incorporated Law Society, to bring this Bill on to the Statute Book, they are Deputy Boland and the present Taoiseach.  As the House will remember, when the Taoiseach resumed office, he had to act as Minister for Justice for quite a few months and, even during that period, it fell to his lot to deal with this Bill and to enter into discussions and negotiations about it.  I am glad the Taoiseach and Deputy Boland have done it and it is right, also, that tribute should be paid to the Incorporated Law Society for having the courage, the wisdom and the foresight to initiate this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an ordinary member of that body &mdash;never having served on the council&mdash;<Col N="1009" /> I should like to say that I think every member of the solicitors' profession owes a debt of gratitude to the members of the Council of the Incorporated Law Society who have, time after time, throughout the years, been pressing for the introduction of this legislation.  I say that because I think it is necessary to make it clear that, so far as the solicitors' profession is concerned, they do not look upon this Bill as a Bill imposed upon them by the Legislature.  They consider it a Bill which they themselves seek and desire, a Bill of fundamental importance for the profession&mdash;for solicitors in relation to their clients and for the solicitors' profession as a whole in relation to the public at large.</P>
    <P>I think we should put it on record that in the negotiations and discussions which took place between the Department and the Incorporated Law Society, the Incorporated Law Society was speaking for the vast majority of the solicitors' profession.  According to the last report issued by the Incorporated Law Society a short while ago, out of 1,338 solicitors who have practising certificates in this country 1,150 are members of the Incorporated Law Society.  Consequently, when the Bill is welcomed by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society we may take it that they are talking in a fully representative capacity for the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, as Deputy Moran pointed out, no one suffers more in the long run by one solicitor going to the bad than his own colleagues.  The very nature of the work which a solicitor has to perform makes it necessary to have a very high code of professional conduct and I think it is right to say that without any compulsion, without the disciplinary powers which are being given in this Bill, the solicitors' profession as a whole have maintained a high standard of professional conduct and disciplined themselves throughout the years.  But because they recognise their duty to the public and because they recognise it is in the best interests of the profession itself, the Incorporated Law Society feel that a Bill of this kind, <Col N="1010" /> giving the powers to regulate all matters of professional conduct and discipline which this Bill will give, should be brought in, and they welcome that that step should be taken.</P>
    <P>There are six major features in the Bill.  There is the question of the disciplinary committee; secondly, the question of the solicitors' accounts; thirdly, and possibly the most important of all is the question of the compensation fund; fourthly, the provisions dealing with legal education; fifthly, the provisions dealing with the reduction in the number of apprentices; and, sixthly&mdash;a provision which so far has not been touched on and which I think should be mentioned&mdash;the provision in Section 44 of the Bill dealing with the possibility of reciprocity with the North in relation to solicitors.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in any very great detail with these matters but in regard to the disciplinary committee which it is proposed to establish under this Bill, there is a very definite advance being made.  The present position is that the Law Society are enabled to have what is known as a statutory committee which has very limited powers and functions.  These powers are really limited to acting as detectors, to investigating any complaint which may come before it and, if it finds that there has been professional misconduct on the part of a solicitor, then it is bound to report that to the Chief Justice.  The disciplinary committee which is being established in this Act will carry out the same work of investigation but it will also be given the right to impose penalties.  There is also in the Bill before us a right of appeal then by the solicitor or by the applicant to the Chief Justice if he is not satisfied with the decision of the disciplinary committee.</P>
    <P>The big difference between the disciplinary committee and the statutory committee existing at the moment is the power to impose penalties and also the fact that for the first time&mdash;I think I am right in saying&mdash;there will be powers to the governing body of the profession to impose penalties of a varying nature according to the degree <Col N="1011" /> of gravity of the matter into which they are inquiring.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything with regard to the solicitors' accounts or the regulations to be made concerning them because other speakers have dealt with that matter fully.  I believe that it is an improvement in our legislation and&mdash;I think Deputy Moran referred to it&mdash;that it is quite possible that some of the misfortunes which solicitors who were guilty of defalcations had might have been avoided had they been required during their early years to keep proper accounts in their own offices and if the public had the protection of the statutory bank account for clients' or trust moneys.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, the most important feature of this Bill is the compensation fund.  It is important both from the solicitors' point of view and, as the Taoiseach has pointed out very rightly, in the public interest.  I think I am correct in saying that the provisions in this Bill in relation to the compensation fund go very much further than the similar provisions in England.  With regard to the compensation fund when this Bill has been passed, we will have, so far as the solicitors' profession is concerned, the most up to date and progressive legislation probably in the world.  I understand the position to be in England that the controlling body of the solicitors' profession there has at all times unlimited discretion with regard to what awards it will make out of the fund, how the claims will be dealt with and that the body dealing with the claims under the English legislation need not give any reasons for their decision, that they may refuse or allow a claim as they see fit without giving reasons.  Under the compensation fund being established here, discretionary power will vest in the Council of the Incorporated Law Society for a limited period of five years and after that the discretion of the council will only be in cases where they find there has been negligence on the part of the claimant, the person who has been at a loss.  In cases where they are satisfied that the loss is attributable to the dishonesty of <Col N="1012" /> the solicitor and that no question of negligence on the part of the applicant comes in, then the applicant must be compensated whatever the loss may be.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the sections dealing with education except to point out that it probably will be a matter of surprise to lay Deputies to discover that at the present time the Incorporated Law Society cannot by itself make regulations dealing with such matters as legal education.  From the professional point of view and ultimately from the point of view of the public generally, the powers which are being given in this Act with regard to legal education will prove to be important and beneficial.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 44 of the Bill dealing with reciprocity with the North, it would seem to me that this section might require some amendment.</P>
    <P>I think that from the point of view, if you like, of politics or from a national standpoint, Section 44 is a section that has very many attractions, and a solicitor criticising this section may seem to do so purely from a point of view of self-interest, but that is not necessarily so.  What I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice to, is that under Section 44 as it stands, the provision is that the Government when satisfied that reciprocal provisions will be in operation in relation to solicitors holding practising certificates here can then bring into operation Section 44 of this Bill which will, subject to the matters laid down in the section, enable Northern Ireland solicitors to practise here.  The only point I have in mind about it&mdash;and I think it is possibly worth looking into&mdash;is that one could visualise a situation arising where the Government in the North might make reciprocal arrangements and eventually suspend these arrangements, but if our Government under this Bill by Order bring Section 44 into operation, our Government have no authority under the Bill subsequently to suspend the bringing of Section 44 into operation.  The reply is that that can be done by coming back to the House and passing another Bill.  My suggestion to the Minister is that he should safeguard the position <Col N="1013" /> of the solicitors principally dealt with by this Bill by taking power by Order if necessary to suspend the reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to call the Taoiseach's attention.  It is also a Committee point but I think it is one which ought to be referred to at this stage.  It is in regard to the wording of Section 59 (1) (a).  Section 59 provides that a solicitor shall not wilfully do different things and the first of these things is that a solicitor shall not wilfully act in business carried on by him as a solicitor, as agent for an unqualified person. I think that the probable intention of Section 59 is to replace and re-enact Section 51 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, but I do not think it does that.  It would seem to me that the wording of (a) of Section 59 would make it impossible for any solicitor to practise as a solicitor because the wording as set out here is that a solicitor shall not act in business carried on by him as a solicitor as agent for an unqualified person.  An unqualified person is a person who is not a solicitor and, as any person who is a member of that profession will tell you, practically all our work is in working as agents of people who are not qualified or who are not solicitors themselves.  If they were they would be doing the work themselves.  It is quite clear that the Government intended, by this section, to prevent a solicitor qualified to practise from using his office as a front or a façade for an unqualified person, but in fact if this section were to be rigorously interpreted it would mean that a solicitor could not act as an agent for any person who was not a solicitor.  I think if (a) was worded quite simply to say &ldquo;a solicitor shall not wilfully carry on business as solicitor as agent for an unqualified person&rdquo; that the position would be covered, but certainly, as it stands, there is something wrong with the wording there and something which I would suggest the Taoiseach would look into.</P>
    <P>I think those of us who are members of the solicitors' profession appreciate the manner in which the Taoiseach has presented this Bill to the House and will appreciate the remarks he has <Col N="1014" /> made both with regard to the profession and with regard to the governing body of the profession.  I would like to say that I personally appreciate very much the way in which the House, and particularly those Deputies who are not solicitors, have received the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to welcome this Bill.  I think that the long period that has been spent on the negotiations for it have produced good fruit.  This Bill, to my mind, will be very good both for the profession and the public.  Undoubtedly in the past the huge bulk of the solicitors have suffered gravely in prestige through the default of perhaps just one of their members&mdash;certainly of a very small number&mdash;and I think the provisions of this Bill for the compensation fund and the keeping of accounts will go a long way towards assuaging a feeling that has got into some people's minds that all solicitors are not to be trusted.</P>
      <P>On the compensation fund, I personally at first felt that a bond would be the proper way of dealing with it, but I must say that on the case that has been put up by the Incorporated Law Society against it I was convinced that the provisions in this Bill are far better in every way.</P>
      <P>There may well be a number of points that will come up on the Committee Stage, but on the whole, I think the Bill will make for a great improvement and that it is one to be welcomed both by the profession and the public and the Law Society are to be congratulated on bringing it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to express my appreciation and the appreciation of my colleagues of the way in which this Bill has been met by Deputy Boland and his colleagues and by Deputy MacBride and, in fact, by all Deputies in the House.  I am also grateful for the notification&mdash;if I may call it that&mdash;of the desire to have this Bill in operation next year.  I think, in the interests of the profession and the public, that it should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, of course, have all the points that have been raised considered between this and the Committee Stage, and we hope to clear the Committee <Col N="1015" /> Stage and have the whole Bill in operation in due time.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride made a point on Section 12.  The answer to that is that the section appeared in quite a number of other Acts dealing with medical practitioners and dentists and has caused no trouble, and the person concerned has made no complaint.  I think on the whole it is quite innocuous in the present Bill, and if one does not comply with it nothing happens.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's other points on Section 54&mdash;that section is a re-enactment of the Solicitors Act of 1943.  I think the history of it, if my memory serves me properly, is that a State solicitor did the dirty upon a private solicitor by raising the point that he had not paid his licence fee and therefore he was not entitled to be paid his costs, and that particular solicitor lay in wait for the State solicitor when he was looking for his costs and raised the point that the State solicitor had not paid his licence fee.  That was the position until that period.  The payment of the particular annual fee or other fees that are chargeable to solicitors by solicitors who are in State employment was and will be until this Bill is law really a book-keeping transaction; one of the parties paid the amount and the other got credit for it.  Being such, I assume, was the reason for the passing of the Solicitors Act, 1943.  The intention is to continue that practice under this Bill to avoid the pretence of a State solicitor or a solicitor in Civil Service employment having his fee paid by one Department and it going into another Department &mdash; a mere book-keeping transaction.</P>
    <P>Probably, I think, the real reason for this particular enactment about solicitors in State employment is the desire that they shall not have to pay the contribution payable by private solicitors towards the compensation fund.  There is no provision imposing an obligation upon solicitors in State employment to pay such contribution because of the fact that the State will make no claim upon the compensation fund itself, but if any claim is made against the State by reason of the defalcation <Col N="1016" /> of a solicitor in the employment of the State the State will discharge the liability itself.  I think that is the reason for the section as it stands.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Moran's point on the same section as to the nomenclature, &ldquo;Civil Service solicitor or solicitor in the State service,&rdquo; the Parliamentary Draftsman is responsible for the phrase as it stands at the moment and I am sure there is no sinister meaning in it but, if there is, we will change it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran made a number of points.  This perhaps is not the appropriate moment to reply to them.  The first point was on Section 14, providing that application shall be made to procure the removal of the name of a solicitor from the roll of solicitors on the ground that he has been convicted of treason or of a felony or mis-demeanour or has been convicted outside the State of a crime or offence which would be a felony or mis-demeanour if committed in the State.</P>
    <P>The answer, if it be the answer, is that that particular provision is in all the other Acts dealing with professional bodies that are regulated by statute.  Another answer, I think, and one perhaps that will appeal more to Deputy Moran is the fact that under the law as it stands at the moment there is no specific detailed provision laid down as to the circumstances in which a solicitor may be struck off the roll.  The solicitors' disciplinary committee is the body that at the moment have authority to recommend that the name of a solicitor be struck off the roll for &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that may be.  It means whatever the disciplinary committee think is misconduct subject to the Chief Justice agreeing with it and if a man is convicted of being a rogue and a vagabond or perhaps of having been guilty of being drunk while in charge of a car on the Continent of Europe, the committee, subject to the Chief Justice, has the authority at the present moment to recommend that his name be struck off the roll.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any very great substance in the point raised by Deputy Moran, but we will have it <Col N="1017" /> examined.  I do not express any view upon the constitutionality of it.  The Supreme Court have laid down the rule of interpretation that if the Oireachtas passes a law they start off with the assumption that it is constitutional.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran then raised another point, I think on Section 23, that there is no stay of execution.  I think he has a point there.  Although, under Section 18 (2), the disciplinary committee may postpone the making of an order under the section, nevertheless, I think possibly the Deputy has a point and we will look into it.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Moran's point that apprentices, when they pass their final examination, should be compelled to serve a year in a solicitor's office following the analogy of the doctor, after passing his final examination, having to continue a course for 12 months, I have no strong views on that. The position has not been put up to any Government as far as I know, but we took a strong view on the subject of the length of time during which a solicitor's apprentice would be bound to serve his apprenticeship before being qualified.  We took the view that the length of the period of time was unfair to poor people or poorish people&mdash;because I do not suppose any poor person can afford to send his son or daughter to be a solicitor.  To poorish people relying on their own efforts to save the necessary money to provide the necessary expense for educating their son or daughter and keeping him or her in Dublin or elsewhere while he or she is continuing an apprenticeship the expense is very steep.  We felt a period of five years would be adequate as the length of time for qualifying as a solicitor although we fully appreciated, not the point made by Deputy Moran, but the point that was rather put up to us by the Incorporated Law Society that a period of six years is required for the proper education of the solicitor's apprentice, not merely in the technicalities of his profession but also adequately to equip him for his profession in the future.  On the whole we came to the conclusion that five years was the best possible period in all the circumstances, and to that the solicitors' profession agreed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> With regard to the point made by Deputy O'Higgins on Section 59 (1), I think he too has a point there.  Of course, it is a drafting point.  The subsection, as it is drafted at the moment, is open to criticism along the lines suggested by Deputy O'Higgins.  All my colleagues here on the Front Bench at the moment, with the exception of the Attorney-General, are all exbarristers for the moment at any rate and we recall the fact that most of our opinions start off by saying: &ldquo;Agent should do so and so,&rdquo;&ldquo;agent,&rdquo; of course, being the solicitor who acts for his client and, therefore, sub-section (1) (a) is open to the construction that a solicitor acting as agent, as he is, for his client, would come within the paragraph of the sub-section.  It is a drafting point and we will have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>Again, I appreciate the manner in which this Bill has been received by the House and particularly the fact that the Opposition and all other Parties in the House will co-operate in seeing that this Bill becomes law before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, which experience has shown to be desirable. The amendments are, in the main, minor ones which deal with the financial activities of the council and remedy certain difficulties which have arisen.  The only innovation in the Bill is in Section 3 which will permit persons from abroad to be temporarily registered as medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Practitioners Act of 1927 established the Medical Registration Council as the statutory supervisory body for medical practitioners in this country.  Provision had been made under the medical Acts of the last <Col N="1019" /> century for the registration and supervision of persons practising medicine in Ireland but these functions were exercised in this country, prior to 1927, by an Irish branch of the British General Medical Council.  The 1927 Act, which was the outcome of an agreement with the British authorities, transferred the function of keeping a register of medical practitioners for this country to the new body.</P>
    <P>The Act provided that the Medical Registration Council should consist of representatives of the universities and other bodies awarding degrees or diplomas which entitled their holders to practise medicine, two persons elected by medical practitioners, and two persons appointed by the Government.  The latter have, in all cases, been medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>The council were given power to establish a register of medical practitioners and to include in it the names of those persons whose medical qualifications entitled them to be registered. Power was given to the council to hold inquiries into the actions of medical practitioners alleged to have committed certain offences and, if the council were satisfied that it was necessary, to remove these practitioners from the register.  In addition to holding inquiries of its own, the council were given power to act, if they so thought fit, on the report of an inquiry held by the British General Medical Council into the actions of a medical practitioner registered in both the British and the Irish Registers.</P>
    <P>The council were required further to satisfy themselves that the standard of medical education given by the bodies awarding diplomas in this country which entitle persons to practise medicine was such as would guarantee the possession by these persons of the skill and knowledge necessary to enable them to practise their profession.</P>
    <P>To carry out their functions, the council were given power to recruit and pay staff, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The power <Col N="1020" /> of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was since transferred to the Minister for Health.  For some years, the council have argued that, as their only income is derived from registration fees and that the State has, therefore, no stake in their funds, they should be given greater autonomy in their expenditure and in the control of staff, subject to certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>By Section 2 of the Bill the term of office of the present council is being extended to the 31st December, 1957. At present the council goes out of office during the month of October and it must meet in July or August to arrange an election of the two direct representatives.  As Deputies will appreciate, this meeting and the election are held in a period when many of the electors and other persons concerned are on holidays, and this makes for an unsatisfactory poll and for inconvenience to those holding the election.  The amendment now proposed will mean that the statutory council meeting can be held in October to arrange the election, and that the election will take place at a much more convenient time for those concerned.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 together provide for temporary registration of persons who hold foreign medical diplomas.  The Government, on the recommendation of the Medical Registration Council, has power at present to make arrangements with other countries for the reciprocal recognition of medical qualifications. A considerable amount of time and work is involved before such agreements can be made and, generally speaking, they are not often justified by the number of persons likely to benefit from them.  There is, however, at the moment a small but constant number of foreign practitioners, who come to this country for post-graduate training, mainly in midwifery and in mental diseases.  As the qualifications which they possess do not entitle them to be registered here, certain disabilities are imposed on these practitioners in carrying out their work.  They cannot, for example, sign certificates which are statutorily required nor can they prescribe dangerous drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> To meet these difficulties the Medical Registration Council has suggested that provision should be made for registering such doctors during the period for which they are employed in hospitals in this country.  Such registration will not entitle them to set up in practice here, but it will give them, while they are working in the hospital, the same privileges and benefits which general medical practitioners enjoy.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is mainly a re-enactment of Section 16 of the 1927 Act.  A new provision is that which will require the council to publish its accounts and the auditor's certificate and report on them within a specified period.  The period proposed in this Bill is six months from the receipt of the auditor's report. In circumstances which I will explain on Committee Stage, I propose to ask the House later to extend that period to 12 months.  It is now provided that publication should take place &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains the other amendments which it is proposed to make in the 1927 Act.  Some of these provide for the removal of certain ministerial controls over the financial activities of the council.  In the first year of its existence the council was assisted from voted moneys, but for many years it has not been in receipt of public moneys and the controls are no longer required.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) makes it clear that fees may be paid to the members of the council for attendance at meetings of its committees.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) provides that the registration fees, from which the council's income is derived, and which are fixed by regulations, shall in future require the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 6 will remedy a difficulty arising out of the British Medical Act of 1950.  Before that Act came into operation the British General Medical Council held inquiries into professional misconduct of medical practitioners on the British Register and, as I have already pointed out, our own Medical Registration Council were authorised by the Act of 1927 to take action, if they so thought fit, on the report of such an <Col N="1022" /> inquiry in relation to a person who was on the Irish Register as well as the British Register.  The British Act of 1950 transferred the power of the General Medical Council to hold inquiries to a special medical disciplinary committee and this sub-section is necessary to enable the Medical Registration Council to act on a report of that committee.  The alternative would be for the Medical Registration Council to hold their own inquiry into such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill makes an amendment in the Act of 1951 which is required as a corollary of those amendments made in the Act of 1927 which remove ministerial controls over the council's financial activities.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the provisions of this Bill so that Deputies may be fully aware of its implications. The amendments which it is proposed to make in the earlier Acts are, I think, reasonable and necessary and it is on that basis that I recommend it to the House for a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill appears to be to remove governmental control from the Medical Registration Council.  Originally, under the main Act of 1927, the Registration Council were in receipt of certain funds from the Government.  At present, as far as I know the situation, they are entirely dependent on their own financial resources.  There are a lot of things in this Bill of which I approve.  In the main it is a good Bill, but I have some criticisms to make in respect of parts of it.  In the first instance I feel that Section 4 is a good section.  We have a great number of doctors coming into this country for the purpose of carrying out studies in different subjects, principally in midwifery for which this country has a pretty sound reputation, and I think the safeguards contemplated in that section are very satisfactory. The position here is that we annually turn out more doctors than we are able to absorb in this country. I think these safeguards are very necessary. They are certainly very satisfactory since they will prevent an increase in this already overcrowded profession <Col N="1023" /> and in the number of doctors available to the public, and will at the same time enable young doctors to find employment without being in competition with foreigners.  The younger men leaving our universities will be in a position henceforth to find such situations as they are fitted for, either for themselves or for the benefit of the people as a whole.  The fact that a separate register is being kept will be sufficient safeguard and will ensure that no difficulties will arise in that direction in future.</P>
      <P>I would like a little clarification on Section 3 where provision is made that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The council may, upon such person's making the prescribed application and paying such fee as may be prescribed with the consent of the Minister, temporarily register such person in the register for such period as the council may determine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to free the Medical Registration Council and for that reason I cannot see why the consent of the Minister should be necessary in this connection.  I think that particular provision could be deleted to the benefit of both the Medical Registration Council and their functions.</P>
      <P>Section 5 appears to me to retain a great deal of ministerial control, a control which appears to be unnecessary. I take it the council which is now functioning is an autonomous body and should, therefore, be wholly responsible for their own finances. They may not seek any adventitious aids from the State.  The section provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The council shall keep, in such form as shall from time to time be directed or approved by the Minister, all proper and usual accounts of all moneys received or expended by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The accounts of the council shall be audited at least once in every year by an auditor appointed for the purpose by the Minister and the fees of such auditor shall be fixed by the Minister and such fees and <Col N="1024" /> also the expenses generally of such audit shall be paid by the council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer, goodness knows, but I do not think other corporations are submitted to such close scrutiny and close control as the Medical Registration Council apparently will be under this measure.  I take it that heretofore such controls have existed. I think they are incompatible to-day with the laws of the country and they should be removed forthwith.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 5 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council shall, after every audit under this section of the accounts of the council and within whichever of the following periods first expires, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a period of two months after the council has held its first meeting subsequent to the submission to the council of the auditor's report, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a period of six months after such submission,</P>
    <P>cause such accounts and the auditor's certificate and report thereon to be printed, published and put on sale either by inclusion in the volume containing the medical register or as a separate volume and shall immediately after every such publication present to the Minister and to each House of the Oireachtas a copy of such accounts and such certificate and report thereon as so printed and published.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me that the Medical Registration Council once this Bill is passed will be free from parliamentary control.  If the Minister can show adequate reason for such controls I shall be satisfied.  From my own general knowledge and experience I do not see why such controls should be necessary.  I do not know what the position is generally with regard to corporate bodies, but I imagine that if someone wishes to procure a copy of a particular body's accounts he can do so at any bookstall or publications office.</P>
    <P>As far as the rest of the Bill goes, it is very satisfactory.  I welcome it. <Col N="1025" /> Anything that tends towards freeing an institution, no matter what institution it may be, from Government control is, in my opinion, to the benefit of the body itself and the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>

      <P>With regard to some of the matters raised by Deputy Dr. Esmonde I think it might be better if some of his objections were raised on the Committee Stage rather than on this stage.  Broadly speaking, as I understand his criticism, it is confined mainly to the insertion of the Minister in relation to fees to be charged for registration and also in relation to the auditing provisions in Section 5.  I will welcome a discussion on these matters on the Committee Stage.  In any event, there are a few ministerial amendments that I shall be moving on that stage and I think we can more appropriately deal with the points raised by the Deputy at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Lands to participate in a proposed increase of capital in Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Act of 1949, which it is now proposed to amend, authority was given to acquire 5,100 shares of £1 each in this company, which is engaged in the drying and milling of sea-rods collected along the west coast.  The remaining 4,900 shares are held by Alginate Industries, Limited, London, a company engaged in the extraction of alginates from various kinds of seaweed, including the dried and milled sea-rods sold to them by Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report to the House that since 1949, Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited, has operated successfully at its factory in Connemara and has shown a modest profit each year.  Of far more importance than this profit, however, is the contribution which this relatively small company has made towards the provision of steady and remunerative employment in one of the poorest districts in the Gaeltacht.  A report on the working of the company has been submitted each year for the information of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The report on last year's operations shows that the company maintained full and continuous employment at its factory in Kilkerrin, County Galway, and that direct and indirect wages paid there amounted to over £8,000. In addition, locally produced turf to the value of over £4,000 was consumed, and then, of course, the sea-rods themselves, bought as they are in the <Col N="1027" /> poorest areas along the western seaboard, are a satisfying source of supplementary income where it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The company now proposes to expand its activities, first by improving its existing facilities for the drying and milling of sea-rods; secondly, by providing facilities for the purchase and preparation of carrageen for various markets; and, thirdly, by providing facilities for the production of seaweed meal for cattle-food. Additional capital will be required and this Bill seeks to authorise the expenditure of £37,900 on the purchase of shares in addition to the £5,100 already expended, making a total of £43,000, as set out in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first of the objectives I have mentioned, namely the improvement of the existing plant for the drying and milling of sea-rods, the company is satisfied as a result of the working experience of the last five years that more efficient and economic production can be achieved by effecting some changes in plant and lay-out at their factory in Kilkerrin.  Several improvements have been made from time to time, including the installation of a Mona jet furnace and E.S.B. power supply.  I am satisfied that the improved layout and the new plant now proposed will strengthen the position of the company as a supplier of rod-meal and that their proposals are prudent and desirable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that the company should engage in the carrageen industry it will be necessary to give a brief review of the recent history of this industry.  The quantity of carrageen harvested has been falling steadily in the last few years.  In 1940, 1941 and 1942 this country exported an average quantity of 600 tons of carrageen per annum.  In 1952, 1953 and 1954 the average quantity exported is estimated at less than 250 tons, and the tendency from year to year is downwards.  My Department has had the position under close examination, and visits were made to France and the United States to study the organisation and development of the industry in these countries.  Efforts were made <Col N="1028" /> to have exporters of carrageen cooperate in an association to safeguard the quality of moss for export, but I regret to say that the response received was poor.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards was requested to develop a machine for the mechanical cleaning and grading of carrageen with a view to securing a general improvement in standard, and this machine was demonstrated to various firms and persons interested in the industry but, so far as I am aware, no one has yet proposed to install it.</P>
    <P>The collection of carrageen moss can be a very useful means of augmenting the income of those living along the west coast, and the decline of the industry is a matter of concern.  This is particularly so when investigations have disclosed that there is a ready market in America, Great Britain and the Continent provided that the purchasers can be assured of consistently high quality and regularity of supply. The lack of consistency in these matters has brought about a certain instability in the industry, which is reflected in the decline in the quantity harvested and exported.  As carrageen moss is a raw material of great value, and as its collection depends on the maintenance of a tradition for the work along the western coast, it is clearly necessary that some steps should be taken to set a standard which will gain for Irish moss a high reputation in world markets and so bring about conditions of stability to encourage the gatherers and arrest the present heavy decline in interest among them.  It is proposed, therefore, that Alginate Industries (Ireland), Limited, should equip themselves to handle and market carrageen moss to the best advantage, and I am satisfied that this step is both necessary and desirable.  I am hopeful that as a result of the company's efforts there will be a revival of interest among gatherers and that the industry will be put on the right road to development.</P>
    <P>Finally, the company also proposes to put itself in a position to produce seaweed meal for cattle-food.  In the neighbourhood of its factory at Kilkerrin, Connemara, the company can draw from the richest beds of <Col N="1029" /> ascophyllum or bladderweed in the world, and this would undoubtedly be a welcome addition in income to the people of the area.  The company has, in fact, in the last two years produced limited quantities of this meal by extemporary modifications to their sea-rod plant, and the entire production was sold abroad.  The company is satisfied that there is a reasonable market on the Continent and elsewhere, and believes that with the installation of a suitable plant efficient and economic production could be achieved.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the company is seeking additional capital to enable it&mdash; first to improve the operation of the existing sea-rod meal business; secondly to equip itself for the handling of carrageen moss, and thirdly to provide facilities for the production of seaweed meal for cattle-food.  All three items relate to the development and use of native raw materials in parts of our country where natural resources are poor.  The difficulties in the way of improving the economic situation of the people who have to make a livelihood in these areas are so great that it is all the more important that whatever resources are available should be developed to the full.  The Bill now before the House seeks to authorise me to provide additional capital for the company for the purposes set out.  Having regard to the excellent work of the company to date and the desirability of the further developments now proposed, I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

Bhíomar foighdeach go dtí seo leis an tionscal atá bunaithe in gCill Chiaráin. Bhí a fhios againn nach raibh mórán dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ann.  Is maith an rud é go bhfeiceann an tAire anois go bhfuil sé in am tabhairt faoin gceist arís.  Bhí mé féin ag súil le tuilleadh eolais ón Aire mar gheall ar fheidhm a bhaint as feamainn seachas min a dhéanamh as.  Ba mhaith liom, <Col N="1030" /> nuair a bheas an tAire ag cur deireadh leis an ndíospóireacht seo, go mbeadh ar a chumas tuilleadh eolais a thabhairt dúinn ar cad tá ar siúl thar lear in áiteanna go gcuirtear an fheamainn as Cill Chiaráin&mdash;féachaint an féidir linne, sa tír seo, feidhm a bhaint as na próiseanna céanna.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an gcarraigín, sin ábhar eile ina bhfuil sean-chleachtadh ag muintir an chósta le blianta.  Go dtí seo, ar chuma ar bith, ní raibh mórán feidhm á bhaint as ach amháin chun críocha leighis, ag dochtúirí agus eile.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill that the Minister has explained but there are certain points about which, personally, I should like to have got some information from him.  We know that only certain elementary processes are carried out in Kilkerrin and that this partially processed product is sent across the sea.  I understand that, mostly, it goes to Scotland for final processing.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, what these uses are to which Irish seaweed is put in foreign factories and what the prospects are of applying these processes in the factory at Kilkerrin and elsewhere if it is thought advisable to have further units around the coast.  There are chemists who believe that a great deal more can be done here than we have attempted to do up to the present. I recognise that manufacturers who use the products produced from this processed seaweed must be taken into the reckoning and that their goodwill and co-operation must be got.  However, it does seem to me that, very possibly, if the final processes to which this seaweed is subjected could be carried out in the Irish factory, we might be able to sell the fully processed weed at a cheaper price to the manufacturers who use it.  That is a consideration which I think the Minister might take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect him to give us precise information at this early stage, but I should like if he could indicate approximately what effect this further provision of capital will have on the question of employment: what additional employment will be given, and <Col N="1031" /> what, say, further demand will be created by this extension for the subsidiary products such as fuel to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The proposal to do something for carrageen moss is also very welcome. Carrageen moss was for a long period, in the popular mind in any event, thought to be used only for certain medicinal purposes.  I believe before the first World War it was used in Germany for industrial processes.  It is not a matter of great concern to the carrageen gatherers for what purpose it is used provided there is a steady market and a reasonable price is obtainable for it.  To the extent to which this factory will provide such a demand, this Bill is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This being a very highly technical undertaking the layman is at a disadvantage in discussing this Bill with any great degree of intelligence, but I have definitely gathered from certain people who have specialised knowledge that it is an industry that is worthy of further experimentation and further expenditure of money.  I do not think there is anybody on this side of the House who will cavil or complain if these experiments do not succeed to the extent we all would like.  The Minister can, therefore, be assured that whatever criticism he may receive from this side of the House on proposals such as are embodied in this Bill will be entirely constructive and will have no element at all of Party in them.  I congratulate the Minister in his efforts in this respect and I hope they will be crowned with success.  We agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I was unable to be present when the Minister introduced the Bill, but being aware of the purpose of its introduction I can assure him that I welcome it.  I trust that the money now being provided for the purposes of the acquisition of more shares in Alginate Industries will be used to expand this very valuable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one aspect of administration in which in one sense being so technical and in another sense so essential changes of administration should <Col N="1032" /> not and, I think, do not have any effect on the progress of the alginate industry.  Unfortunately, progress is all too slow largely because capital is very limited.  Therefore, any provision for new capital that can be used in the expansion of the industry is something to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are very many branches of the industry that can be developed, and I am sure the Minister mentioned them in the course of his introductory speech, but I would also like to urge on the Minister if at all possible to use this increased capital to make the harvesting of the crop more attractive. Some few months ago the Minister's representative went to America to investigate the method of harvesting they had there, and I believe reported favourably on the increased harvest that could be got by the employment of more up-to-date methods.  Everybody knows that the saving of seaweed, no matter in what form, is a rather hard and certainly an unpleasant type of operation.  Therefore, anything that would make it more pleasant and easy for the harvesters to gather in the seaweed would certainly inure to the benefit of the industry as a whole.  I do not wish to delay the House any longer except to wish the Minister well in this expanding venture, and to wish Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited, well.  I hope that the employment that will accrue from this increased capital will be considerable, and will only be a prelude to further increased employment along the western seaboard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Bartley and Deputy Lynch for their message of goodwill in connection with the Bill.  It will not be a cure for all the ills of the area but it will bring a certain amount of improvement. The Gaeltacht Services Division has reached the stage where they are advancing and making good progress and it is nice for any Minister for Lands, no matter what Party he belongs to, to be able to come into the House and report that, because in the years immediately following the war certain branches of Gaeltacht Services industry fell on evil days as a result of the world collapse of certain markets <Col N="1033" /> and of the upset caused by the war, over which nobody in this country had any control.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley would like to know about the employment position.  It is not easy to anticipate what the immediate employment will be but I do not think I am over-optimistic in saying that by the time the three branches&mdash; sea-rods, carrageen and ascophyllum&mdash; go into production as a result of the expansion proposed in this Bill, at least 20, but perhaps 25 to 30 extra labourers will be employed.</P>
      <P>I will not hazard a guess as to what the extra amount of turf will be for this reason: we are burning about 2,000 tons a year at the present time in the course of the drying and milling of sea-rods and when it comes to the drying of carrageen I am not so sure that any fuel such as turf, coal or oil will be used.  They might possibly leave a taint coming from the aroma of the drying carrageen which would be undesirable seeing that possibly the product will be used in some cases for human food and in other cases where the utmost cleanliness is desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to inform the House what the position is regarding carrageen. In 1936, 216 tons were produced; in 1937, 396 tons; in 1938, 288 tons, and so on, reaching a peak period of 625 tons in 1942; then a steady decline set in in 1942 until the present time we are down to 202 tons.  That is even lower than the 1936 figure.  For that reason it is desirable for us to put our best foot forward and to make sure that the carrageen we process in Kilkerrin will reach the market in the most attractive and up-to-date condition in which we can turn it out.  I am sorry to say that the industry as it has existed up to this is in a dying condition.  It rose from 250 tons in 1936 to over 600 tons in 1942 and since then has been declining.  I am not giving any reason for that although I could hazard a guess that failure in regard to clean handling and presentation in the most attractive condition is one of the major reasons for it.  For that reason I cannot estimate as to what the increased turf consumption would be.  I have not the slightest doubt that the drying of ascophyllum <Col N="1034" /> for cattle foods will cause an increase in the use of turf and that there will be some increase in the consumption of turf due to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley touched on another question when he said he would like to know if it is possible to do the final processing of sea-rods here.  The position is roughly this&mdash;a product known to the commercial world as alginic acid is extracted from sea-rods.  Its extraction is a complicated process and we have not got the secret of how it is produced commercially.  It is a highly valuable commodity, I believe, but it appears that even in Europe there is only one firm, Alginates Limited, London, that has the secret of extracting it economically on a commercial basis.  Small quantities could be extracted but not on an economic basis. I would like to see the day come when we would be able to do that work ourselves here but when I point out that our opposite number in England are purchasing all the sea-rods that can be gathered in Scotland and along the English coast as well as all we are producing here, it will show that even if we started a factory here we would be very limited as to quantity unless we were to go to Norway or the U.S. or somewhere else to purchase sea-rods and that would not be likely.  I am afraid the quantity of raw material available would not be sufficient even if we had the secret.  Nobody else in England or Western Europe seems to have the information and there is only one single alginate concern in the United States that I know of, making two in all, and these are the only two who have the secret of extracting alginic acid from the sea-rods economically.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned the industry is working out satisfactorily and is a boon to the sea-rod gatherers along the west coast.  The money we are able to pay them is a very welcome supplement to their ordinary earnings by fishing or on the land, or both.  It is a thriving little industry and by adding carrageen moss and seaweed meal we hope to expand it to its fullest extent.  Along the west coast there is a valuable crop of these three different kinds of seaweed and it is right to take advantage of them.  So far there <Col N="1035" /> is no indication that there is the slightest risk in going ahead.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe&mdash;if it is not slightly over-ripe&mdash;for digging deep into the other two kinds of seaweed.  This is not a venture, because, as I already told the House, seaweed meal has been turned out by an improvised plant in Kilkerrin successfully and is being exported at a modest profit and there is no likelihood of a limit to that no matter how much we can handle&mdash; it seems there is a market for it in Europe particularly as an additional mixture to certain cattle feeds.  It is very much in demand at prices which allow us to pay the gatherers reasonably.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Lynch mentioned the difficulties of harvesting the crop.  I will see what can be done along these lines.  I am aware that in some places where the seashore is steep or rocky the gatherers suffer a good deal perhaps having to drag the seaweed on their backs over the rocks to where it can be dried.  I will see what can be done in that way by helping them out and perhaps providing paths or suitable tracks for a horse and cart, and also perhaps drying walls.  In my own county, where I am familiar with some of the gathering areas, there are places where they are lucky to have a nice piece of shoreline but there are others where gatherers suffer very much.  I will look into the Deputy's suggestion and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages now.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill which I think really had its origin in the desire of the former Taoiseach that these Acts should be repealed, is to repeal the Mortmain Acts.  The nature and objects of the <Col N="1036" /> Mortmain Acts are set out in the explanatory memorandum, and the effect of these Acts are set out very fully and &mdash;I think&mdash;very clearly, and it is not necessary for me to weary the House by going through them.  If Deputies will look at the list of Mortmain Acts as set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the memorandum the mere perusal of the Acts as detailed will in itself form a justification for their repeal.  The Mortmain Acts were brought into operation in this country by the rather wellknown and infamous Poyning's Law. They go back to 1279, 1285, 1344 and 1391.  With one possible exception these Acts no longer have any effect in practice in this country.  The principle of mortmain, as it is called, really had its origin in the feudal laws and tenure of real property.  If land were transferred to the corporation, the barons and people who were entitled to certain feudal aids were done out of their little perquisites.</P>
      <P>The net result was, in effect, that the Acts were passed originally, I think, to prevent religious corporations from owning land and then any corporation of any kind from holding land without a licence from the Crown.  Those Acts, in so far as they were law, were carried over here into our legal code.  They have no effect whatever at the present time except in one particular instance: a foreign corporation that is not incorporated under the Companies Acts in England and that cannot come within particular sections of those Acts cannot hold land in this country without a licence from the Government.  In effect those licences were granted freely and as a matter of course because it was a pure formality.  A foreign corporation that cannot find any statutory basis for holding land could in effect get over the provisions of these Mortmain Acts by getting even a foreigner and certainly our own citizens to hold land on their behalf. They could also incorporate themselves here in this country as a company.  The net result of the whole thing is that these Acts are cluttering up unnecessarily our Statute Book and wasting time of any Government that has to give a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, we propose that the House should take them out of our <Col N="1037" /> legislative way.  It will in effect mean that foreign companies can now hold land in this country if they wish to do so.  I personally think that that is something which is rather in line with modern tendencies of international law.  Certainly, some years ago, I was engaged on a body that is charged with the consideration of the codification of international law and my recollection is that the general tendency was that a company incorporated in one State should be entitled to hold land in the territory of the other and <i>vice versa</i>.  At all events, these statutes serve no useful purpose whatever and we should get rid of them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these Acts are now, for all practical purposes, obsolete and the only instance where they arise now is in regard to the granting of a licence to a foreign corporation to hold land. These licences, as I have already stated, are granted from time to time as a matter of course.  Any alien may acquire land in his private capacity. So that, if a foreign corporation desires to acquire land it can in fact do so by taking the land in the individual names of the members of the corporation or by forming a joint stock company here.  Even where a foreign corporation acquires land in the name of the corporation the Irish Mortmain Act of 1792 simply enacts that the land shall be forfeited to the State.  Having said that the land shall be forfeited to the State it fails to supply any machinery whereby the land could be effectively forfeited to the State, and I think it is putting it at its highest to say that it is very doubtful if the State could ever forfeit the land.  The Irish Mortmain Act of 1792 is of no practical effect whatever.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the Bill does something useful in getting rid of the Acts.  The Acts were originally measures against religious corporations and we have no longer any such corporations in this country.  Under the Constitution every religious denomination has the right to own, acquire and administer property. Ordinary business corporations are dealt with under the Companies Acts and if it is desired that any restriction should be placed on foreign companies owning land here, on which I express <Col N="1038" /> no opinion beyond the view I have already indicated, that can be dealt with under the Companies Acts.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Taoiseach introducing this Bill I could not help thinking that it is a pleasure to hear an expert, as the Taoiseach is, opening a matter of this nature, because he has stated the position very clearly to the House and I do not think anybody can add very much to it.</P>
      <P>There are just two points that arise, however, for me to comment on.  One is the point which the Taoiseach has raised himself, namely, the matter of foreign corporations.  Quite obviously, these old statutes were in effect no real safeguard at all, there were so many ways around them, and it would be better to deal with that matter perhaps directly.  There are certain statutory provisions on the Statute Book enacted by this Parliament which are some safeguard and, if necessary, they could be added to.</P>
      <P>I refer to that point with this in view that, while accepting these repeals and thinking they should be done and accepting everything the Taoiseach has said, it may be that in another context and in other circumstances the question of foreign interests holding land or property here might require the consideration of the Government and the Oireachtas but, strictly speaking, as far as this Bill is concerned, it is another day's work.</P>
      <P>I do not think that these existing Acts which are now to be repealed were any real safeguard or advantage at all.  As the Taoiseach said they were merely so much lumber on the Statute Roll.  If this matter has to be dealt with then it is perhaps better dealt with in another context.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I might refer to which has not been already referred to.  There seems in some quarters to be perhaps some misunderstanding. I fail to see why.  I understand that these repeals in no way interfere with the position in regard to charitable donations and bequests. I wonder would the Taoiseach or the Attorney-General confirm that fact.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The reason that I say this and that I would like to have it on the record is that sometimes the word &ldquo;mortmain&rdquo;, as the White Paper says, was loosely extended and there were some people who may have thought that the provisions of this Bill in some way affected the provisions in regard to charitable donations and bequests. That is not so.  Therefore I do not think I should delay the House any longer.  The Taoiseach's statement, as far as I can see, was very frank, very complete and very informative and we should not hesitate about giving this Bill a rapid passage through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11 (a):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To add at the end of the section the following sub-section (as a sub-section <Col N="1040" /> to be added to Section 19 of the Act of 1941):</P>
    <P>(5)  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to add to the section a sub-section which will provide that any regulation made by the appropriate Minister under Section 19 of the Act of 1941, as amended by Section 14 of this Bill, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In view of all we have heard on this matter, I feel sure the amendment will be accepted readily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment will be readily accepted and welcomed and I very much appreciate the Minister's intentions and interest in putting it down.  I think it is only fair to the Minister to say that this particular amendment was on record by the Minister before we opened the debate on the Bill.  As I said, we all welcome the amendment and we appreciate the Minister's attitude heretofore on this matter.  There is one thing I should like to say now to the Minister in regard to this amendment and that is that we go back again to that naïve sub-section or paragraph in Section 14 (n) providing for directions&mdash;that the directions would not be captured by this amendment.  But as this matter is to be raised on the Report Stage we shall leave it at that for the time being.  It is, however, a point to appreciate that even though the regulations which would provide for the supplementing of legislation by directions&mdash;and on the other hand the legislation which would provide for the supplementation of the directions in view of this new amendment&mdash;would come before us in the House, the actual directions given in pursuance of that empowering Order would not.  It would remain hidden and secret as far <Col N="1041" /> as the particular legal and statutory effect of this is concerned.  Therefore, the only question I would put to the Minister now is that that point should be borne in mind when it comes to considering sub-section (n) on Report Stage as the Minister has said.  I think I need not dwell any further on this particular point while we are awaiting the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 14, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear what is behind this particular section. Perhaps the Minister will explain to what extent this section, if the Bill becomes an Act, would be operated. There is another section which deals with the transferring of an officer from one office to another and, possibly, from one area to another that might not be suitable for him.  The powers conferred by this section would put such an officer into a particular class outside the class in which he was before being transferred.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The powers conferred by this section in relation to a specified office may be exercised notwithstanding that such office belongs to a class, description or grade in relation to which the powers conferred by this section have already been exercised.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words this means, subject of course to the Minister making the point clear, that an officer may belong to a particular class or description and that the Minister may specify him as belonging to a distinct and different class.  I do not want to waste time but I should like that the Minister would explain this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section merely clarifies the law, or rather a doubt on a point of law.  Section 20 of the 1941 Act gives the appropriate Minister the power first of all to define the duties of officers and secondly to assign a particular duty to officers, these powers to be exercised in relation to a specified office or in relation to a class of officer. The doubt is whether the Minister can assign a particular additional duty to <Col N="1042" /> a specified officer if he has not already defined the class to which the specified officer belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the same as I said, and is about as clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may sometimes be necessary to assign a specified duty to a specified officer which is additional to the officer's office or class.  I think that the section clarifies the powers of the appropriate Minister to do this.  It will not preclude the officer concerned from getting extra remuneration for doing extra duties if such an increase in pay is warranted.  The section will empower the appropriate Minister to assign to a particular officer of a particular class special duties and will not prevent him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the position now.  The section as it stands, however, seems to imply that the Minister has power to give additional duties and other work to an officer notwithstanding to what class he belongs.  It was on the question of equity that I was worrying.  The Minister now says that he is not precluded from giving an officer additional remuneration for additional duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not made clear in this section.  It does not become a statutory obligation on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is dealt with on the administrative side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said unreservedly.  It seems to be fair, but we have had experience that in instances where such positions are not made clear in the Act, the person concerned has no right whatever to claim what the Minister says he would impliedly be entitled to.  Now, that is the difficulty.  On a number of occasions here we have had discussions on a section of an Act and the Minister in all good faith has voiced an opinion and given an undertaking somewhat similar to that given by the Minister here to-night.  Yet when that Act comes into operation and a person makes a claim, even before a court of law, what <Col N="1043" /> the Minister has said here and the official report of his intention here has no standing whatsoever in a court of law.  It is in order to have some protection for the officer concerned that I am interested in this.</P>
      <P>The Minister may in the interests of economy say that: &ldquo;I think this particular individual, or individuals, can do a great deal more work; we will add this and this duty to them.&rdquo; Now in the individual's appointment no such additional work was contemplated and he will have no claim for any additional remuneration even if it can be argued by the authority under which this man serves that in fact the additional duties would clearly qualify him for promotion in his status, which promotion would give him the necessary additional salary or emolument. I wonder would the Minister be prepared to reconsider this and see if it is possible to have some clarification of this remuneration side of the question, provided additional duties or extra work attach to an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might for the benefit of the House get certain points of procedure here clarified. Section 20 of the Local Government Act, 1941, provides that the appropriate Minister may by declaration do certain things.  I think the Minister said this is an administrative matter in the first instance.  Now, in what way is such a declaration made? If the Minister were to tell us that I think it would help the subsequent discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, done by Order under seal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it is an administrative Order in the Department and it has to be done at the head of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, every declaration made under this section shall have the force of law in relation to an officer, or officers, to whom it applies.  That is all right.  I can conceive that what has happened in most of these cases is that the Minister by Order under seal, which is a <Col N="1044" /> formal act of the Minister, has made a declaration whereby a set of facts are declared to exist in relation to certain officers; and the effect of the words &ldquo;every declaration shall have the force of law&rdquo; simply means that the declaration is authoritative and cannot be rebutted.  That is the situation.</P>
      <P>We come now to a rather interesting point in our local government code. Unless my memory serves me ill, it is now practically ensured in every case that where a Statutory Rule or Order is made by the Minister he has the power of revocation, annulment and substitution; in other words, he has the retrospective power.  I think that is fairly widely incorporated in the code by now as far as the Minister is concerned.  If we were dealing in Section 20 with a Statutory Rule and Order no such provision as this would be necessary.  I think that is the situation because, of course, the Minister can mend his hand at every turn, subject to the proviso that he has the retrospective powers, powers which I think he has pretty widely in relation to Statutory Rules and Orders.  Is it the position, therefore, that in the case of a declaration, once done it is done and the Minister has no power, so to speak, to adjust it?  Is that the position? Is that the doubt with which we are confronted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is merely to cover a doubt in the law.  As the Deputy will appreciate, under another section of this very Bill we are giving one local authority power to do work for another local authority.  One can visualise the local authority of County &ldquo;A&rdquo; doing work for the local authority of County &ldquo;B&rdquo;; the county engineer of County &ldquo;A&rdquo; will, therefore, have to move into County &ldquo;B&rdquo; for the purpose of doing that work despite the fact that by the terms of his appointment he is merely appointed to do work in County &ldquo;A&rdquo;.  This is merely to remove a doubt in the law as to whether or not we have the power to send him into County &ldquo;B&rdquo; to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and, in substance, we understand the Minister's request.  In substance again, <Col N="1045" /> in the Minister's intention there is reason, but unfortunately we have to deal with a legal document and I would like to be clear in my mind. Suppose a declaration has been made under Section 20 and suppose the Minister does not get this amendment: as the law stands a declaration has been made in relation to a number of persons; can the Minister alter the conditions attaching to these officers by a simple declaration at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He can make such declaration as he wants from time to time?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us read Section 20.  Section 20 provides that the Minister may by declaration do all or any of the following things in respect of a specified class, and then follows what he can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might interrupt the Deputy.  Section 20 permits the doing of certain things in relation to certain specified classes.  Now the proposed new section will enable the Minister to make regulations in relation to an individual coming within that class.  For instance, there might be a state of emergency in civil defence or turf cutting and certain functions might have to be assigned to somebody immediately.  This section will enable the appropriate Minister to assign these duties in a particular case, not in a particular class; therefore, Section 20 is not being contravened in any way by the new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that, but there are certain words in the Minister's amendment that need clarification: for instance, &ldquo;in relation to which the powers conferred by this section have already been exercised.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the important point.  The Minister appreciates that this whole code is a very complex one and one may, on merely looking at one section, misinterpret the law.  I think everybody who has experience of the code in court knows that.  That is why I am being so tentative and careful here in this.  I have a section here which, on its first flush interpretation, it seemed to me that, in 1941, the Oireachtas empowered a Minister to make certain declarations &mdash;and there is nothing on the face of this section to suggest that, thereafter, he could mend his hand.  That is why I ask the Minister the question that, having made the declaration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the essential point in it.  How can he mend his hand if that is so?  A few minutes ago, the Minister gave the impression that the declaration was made once and for all.  However, can the Minister mend his hand and, if so, how?  That will help us a lot in dealing with this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to Section 13 of the Act of 1941, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every power conferred by any section of this Part of this Act to make any Order, regulation, direction or declaration, shall be construed as including a power to revoke or amend any Order, regulation, direction, or declaration made under such section.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I am still tagged to a class of officer.  It may be necessary to add particular additional duties to an individual officer and it <Col N="1047" /> was to clarify the doubt in the law that I brought in this Section 15 of this particular Bill so that I may assign additional duties, not give directions as to the duties of a particular class. I have specified the additional duties which it might be possible to assign under the section.  It may be possible, as I said, for one local authority to go into the area of another local authority to do certain works.  Again, in the case of an emergency, it may be necessary to appoint an officer to take charge of civil defence, the cutting of turf and so forth.  These things must be done immediately.  Under Sections 20 and 13 of the 1941 Act, I have power only to make regulations or give directions to classes.  This will enable me to give directions to individual officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem is not the interpretation of the code of laws as it confronts legal gentlemen in a law court.  My problem is the question of equity as far as the servant of the local authority is concerned.  I can quite see agreement being come to between two local authorities for one to supply a particular officer to do a certain class of work in the other.  Obviously, it is additional work, additional duties. Under this proposed section, he may be ordered to do so by the Minister and he has no answer to that.  It has happened before that one local authority has, in fact, done work in another local authority area and the officers of the local authority of A., say, have been doing it.  The present position is that, provided the order is given by the city or county manager, the officer is bound to do the thing but he would have a claim to put up and say: &ldquo;You have given me additional duties.  I am entitled to some additional consideration.&rdquo;  If this section goes through as it is, there is no claim whatever, from the statutory point of view, so far as the Minister is concerned.  The Minister gives a certain number of illustrations of possible additional duties.  If it is an engineer from, say, Dublin City or some other official who may have to go to another county to supervise and arrange for the cutting of turf, he may have to put in a considerable number of additional <Col N="1048" /> hours in travelling, and so forth, never envisaged either by him or by the people who appointed him.  My only concern is that the Minister has said, in explaining the section, that it would mean that consideration would be given.  If there is extra work, the man will get extra remuneration.  I am pointing out that while we accept the Minister's view without any reservation, experience has shown that, if it is not covered in some form in the Bill, such persons may never be able to secure the additional remuneration because it is not specified in the Act. You are just told you have to do this by Order of the Minister&mdash;and everybody else is removed.  The local authority, the manager&mdash;they have no say.  The claim is direct from him, then, to the Minister.  I should like the Minister to consider some means by which some indication would be given that the Minister himself would be the person who would sanction or direct&mdash;where there were extra duties&mdash;adequate compensatory extra remuneration.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the person who will deal with such an application for additional remuneration. If I were to write into the Act a section dealing with additional remuneration for an officer who does work in another area, then it would be right that I should also write into the section a deduction of salary from the officer in the area in which the work is being done.  I think the whole thing can be dealt with equitably on the administrative side.  The Minister is the person who will have to deal with it.</P>

      <P>The Minister goes a long way in his last remark in saying that the Minister himself is the person who will have to deal with it.  I am glad to see at least that that appears to be the position here on this section. However, quite dispassionately, let us look at this section from two points of view.  Here is a case where I think it would be helpful for us in this House to realise that there are two conflicting points of view and requirements here and we should be equally sympathetic to both.  From the point of view of the Minister and of his Department, there <Col N="1049" /> is the necessity for having the powers of co-ordination and control and for seeing that the administration works reasonably.  Therefore, it is not in this case unreasonable that a Department should put up to their Minister that he should seek powers to enable him to regulate such matters as the Minister mentioned.  On the other hand, I should like to put up this aspect, from the point of view of the employees. Supposing the Minister is right&mdash;that the doubt that he seeks to cure by this is well grounded.  The Minister's position was that he could regulate the duties and functions of officers and holders as a class.  That is the Minister's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, under the 1941 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law up to now&mdash;that the Minister could define it as a class and, from time to time, he had complete powers under Section 13. If he finds that a particular situation should be changed in his administrative view, then he can change it.  The only position to-day, therefore, is that the Minister for Local Government may take class A&mdash;say, county medical officers of health, county engineers, librarians, and so forth&mdash;and say that these are the conditions which attach to these particular offices, and it runs for the offices all over the country.  But, though he can probably segregate by each county&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is for the class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Class&rdquo; is very wide.  What is the interpretation of &ldquo;class&rdquo;?  Could it be considered as a class for a particular group of counties?  However, we are bringing the Minister into more law that he has not contested and perhaps does not want to; we need not go into that. We will assume for the moment&mdash; though there may be an arguable case in the line suggested&mdash;that when he defines &ldquo;class&rdquo; he means all the officers of that class.  I can see there is a certain difficulty in the Minister's or the Department's way if the county medical officer of a particular county, we will say the County of Blank, <Col N="1050" /> is proving a little recalcitrant from the Minister's point of view.  The Minister wants him to do a certain thing or be in a certain position, and finds that he can only compel that county medical officer of health to undertake certain duties if he mends his hand as a whole, so that if he compels the county medical officer of health for Blank to do it, all other officers of health will have to undertake similar duties.</P>
      <P>That I conceive to be the situation at present.  What the Minister wants to be able to do is to isolate the county medical officer of health, the county engineer or any other office holder of the County of Blank and deal with things specifically, and that would be that.  I will not go to the extent of saying that the Minister would be completely unreasonable in seeking to have powers of this nature. After all, he could run into a situation where a particular office holder would be troublesome; on the other hand is it or is it not going a little too far to give this power of dealing specifically with the individual without having the complications of having to deal with other officers of the class?  From the point of view of the class and from the point of view of the individual there is a certain safeguard for the individual as against the machine in the fact that the class of office has to be dealt with rather than a single isolated person in an isolated position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have stated the position in this regard unfairly.  If I have, the Minister will be quick to correct me.  I do not know what the opinion of the House would be in this. My own general leaning would be that I cannot see a situation where powers are necessary specifically that would not be necessary in relation to the class.  On general principle I would be reluctant to grant a provision like this to the Minister, reluctant only on the grounds, I hasten to add, that it is isolating individual office holders for specific and easy action.  I know from the departmental point of view that it is highly desirable, and it may be that it is very reasonable that the Minister should have these powers; nevertheless, I have a feeling that it is no harm <Col N="1051" /> that there might be certain difficulties in the way of the machine; it is no harm that the problem of having to deal with office holders should be faced.  It would be a very wrong thing if we made it easy for a dash of the pen to cure every headache the Department has.  I am afraid the tendency is very much that way in this Bill.  That is the reason I am speaking on it at all.  The principles in this regard and the things the Minister wants to do are common cause between us in many respects but on the wording of the Bill it is too easy to take power to dispose of something with a scratch of a pen, and that is that.  That is why I hesitate on this.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, this is one of the things the Minister will deal with personally and I have not the strong objection I had to Section 14 (n).  The Minister says it is to remove a doubt but the very wording of that section suggests to me that here is a case where a certain office holder has taken office and holds office under certain conditions; when he took office under those conditions he had at that time the safety that existed under Section 20 of the 1941 Act, which tells him that all office holders would be in the same position, so to speak.  Now to his detriment&mdash;and I very much fear it will be to his detriment&mdash;be he county medical officer of health, county engineer or any other officer, a position will be brought about where his case can be isolated, where he can be taken apart from his professional colleagues or his office and dealt with as the Department requires.  I am wondering is it fair.  I wonder is it necessary to give the Minister these powers?  Has he not sufficient power under the present section?  Is this not what I might call a power of convenience for the administration?  If it is merely a power of convenience it is, to my mind, unnecessary and in the present circumstances a dangerous power to take.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the question of an office holder being asked to do duty for another public authority in pursuance generally of the provisions of Section 58 and all that <Col N="1052" /> would flow therefrom.  Supposing you want to bring about a situation where the county medical officer of Blank will carry out the duties for the county medical officer of some other county, surely it is possible to frame a regulation in general terms that will cover every county and every office holder without prejudice to the Minister being able to get things done but also without damaging a particular office holder.</P>
    <P>I must again express my own nervousness of this provision.  I do not like it, and I am not satisfied that it is necessary.  Since 1941 to the present day this situation has ruled.  Admittedly, the case mentioned by the Minister is a new one under this Bill, but I cannot see that Section 58 can be made the excuse&mdash;the Minister will pardon the word; I am not suggesting that he is putting it that way&mdash;or the reason for everything.  If Section 58 is given as the reason, let us answer the argument of Section 58 and on the argument in relation to that section I can only say that I see no valid reason why a general declaration or a general Order wide enough to cover all the classes cannot be made to suit the Minister's requirement.  If it is a question of declaring that all county medical officers of health will undertake, if required, certain duties, I see no reason why that cannot be put in. To make that the excuse for legislating for a specified officer, whether the office holder is the county medical officer of health or the county engineer, seems to me to be a little unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any representations have been made to the Minister on this.  I do not know if the office holders concerned have in any way been consulted in this regard.  It would be interesting to know.  I think a section of this nature requires that in some form or another the views of the people affected should be presented by the Administration, because to some extent it is going back to a question of their initial contract.  However, I have said all I can usefully say on the section, but I would like some further and greater justification for the inclusion of this power&mdash;in view of the <Col N="1053" /> length of time that has elapsed since 1941&mdash;other than Section 58 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned one particular side in which I was interested but there is another side.  This section will now give the Minister direct control of every officer who belongs to a class in a local authority and government by local authority will, by virtue of this section, become possible from the Custom House because, instead of the manager or the local authority deciding the operations or the acts of a particular individual, the Minister may send down an instruction to say: X now must do this or that, work here or there, and I think it is seriously endangering the&mdash;if you life&mdash;democracy we believe attaches to the setting up of local authorities and the electing of them, and the operation of local authorities by the elected representatives in conjunction with the managerial system.  Apart from the other side that I have argued, I think the Minister should hesitate&mdash;in addition to what has been suggested by Deputy Major de Valera&mdash;to insist on this section. From the local authority point of view, it will be the Custom House that will be dictating the actions of the individuals employed by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Deputy Major de Valera that I have consulted the union of local government employees and they have no objection to this section.  Deputy Major de Valera and Deputy Briscoe have made a very good case but they have made it 13 years too late.  At least Deputy Briscoe was a member of this House at that particular time.  I would refer him to Section 20, sub-section (1) of the 1941 Act, which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The appropriate Minister may by declaration do all or any of the following things in respect of a specified office in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister or in respect of such of the offices in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister as belong to a specified class, description or grade, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  define the duties of holders thereof,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> (b)  assign a particular duty to holders thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  define the places or limits within which all or any of the duties of holders thereof are to be performed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A doubt has arisen whether after having given certain directions to a class under that section, he can reject the directions for an individual.  He has power, first of all, for the filling of an individual office and then power to give directions with regard to the class but having given those general directions he may want to amend them as he will require to do if the section empowering one local authority to do work for another is passed.</P>
    <P>He will require to amend them in that particular case.  It is to remove any doubt as to whether he has the right to amend or give directions to an individual in a class in which he has already given directions under Section 20, that this section is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is right and perhaps that particular section of the 1941 Act gave powers that were a little too wide.  I am not going to controvert that.  The question I see arising from the Minister's last remarks is&mdash;if the Minister has all those existing powers under the 1941 Act, particularly in relation to Section 13, why does he want this one?  It is to remove doubts, the Minister says. The Minister will pardon me, I know, and I am not making any imputations against the Minister personally, but when I see amending sections of this sort I am beginning now to be suspicious. However, I do not still see&mdash; particularly in view of the Minister's last statement about Section 20 of the 1941 Act&mdash;why it is necessary to pass this section.  I can see in its wording, without chasing it very much further, certain specific dangers and as the Minister admitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Section 58, I have already given the Minister my <Col N="1055" /> answer to that and it is on the record. There is one point on which I am reassured and I am glad that this consultation has taken place as this shows there is no objection from the parties interested.  Perhaps I am unduly alarmed.  One last word to the Minister as Minister and as a member of this House who has seen this type of legislation from the point of view from which I am looking at it, literally and metaphorically, is that he should keep his weather eye open when such sections as this are going through.  I am beginning to learn that an explanatory White Paper or memorandum can be somewhat misleading when it comes to the actual interpretation of the wording of the section.</P>

It might have been better if the White Paper mentioned Section 20 in relation to Section 58.</P>

When the Special Employments Schemes Office was set up by the late Deputy Hugo Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Works, quantity surveyors were employed as his agents and paid by the commissioners.  It may have been an objectionable arrangement but does this section now enable the Minister to assign such duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 19, to insert &ldquo;the duties of which relate to matters the same as or similar to the matters to which the duties of the first-mentioned office relate and&rdquo; before &ldquo;as&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section as drafted allows a married woman to have a little more scope than was originally intended.  The section was intended to enable her to be promoted within her normal sphere of activity but in fact it permitted any married woman to be promoted to any post in a local authority's service no matter whether that was her normal sphere of activity or not.  For instance, an assistant librarian could be promoted to some other section but the amendment will confine her promotion to the activities of librarian.  The intention of the amendment is to limit the promotion to an analogous type of employment. The Department of Health suggested that while a part-time dispensary midwife who is married might reasonably expect to be promoted from one dispensary district to a more lucrative one, it would not be reasonable to give her the opportunity of being promoted to an entirely different sphere of activity, such as matron of a maternity hospital.  To allow her to come in as a married woman to that institution from which the existing staff have to retire on marriage would cause a great deal of dissatisfaction and the amendment would obviate this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;thereto&rdquo; in line 47 to add &ldquo;and if compensation for disturbance and costs of removal are paid to the officer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to come as an addition to paragraph (5) of Section 17.  In effect, as I understand Section 17, it amends Section 24 of the <Col N="1057" /> 1941 Act in such a way as to enable the transfer of an officer from one local authority to another in certain limited and specified circumstances.  The effect of the amendment is merely to ensure that, if that occurs in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of sub-section (3) of Section 24 of the 1941 Act, that local officer will be entitled to compensation for disturbance and also the cost of his removal from one area to another.  It would seem to be a hardship to compel the transfer of an employee of a local body from one end of the country to another unless there was some provision made to compensate him for disturbance and to pay the cost of his journey and removal, particularly if it involves a man who has a house, a family and furniture. It would seem very harsh to transfer him from one end of the country to the other end, from Cork to Donegal, and expect him to pay for the cost of his journey and the transfer of his furniture and he might also sustain other losses caused by his disturbance.</P>
    <P>I would again like to take this opportunity of complaining of this method of legislation.  We have in Section 17 in fact no less than four different amendments of the 1941 Act rolled up into one section.  It really becomes practically impossible for any person to ascertain what the law is when legislation is framed in this way. I know that it is not the Minister's fault but I think it is necessary on every occasion when measures of that kind come up framed in this way that members of the House should protest about it.  I say quite frankly that, if this goes on, a stage will come when I will actually vote against the passage of legislation in this form even if I agree with the purpose of the legislation, because I think it will become necessary to be firm about it.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House should join in adopting that attitude. It is the only way in which we can try to put a stop to what is an evil practice that has grown up for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.  It is an amendment which, I know, the Local Government Employees' Union is <Col N="1058" /> anxious to see adopted and I hope the Minister may be able to meet their point of view in the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the section, first of all, the section proposes to legislate for new circumstances which are arising every day, for instance, the establishment of regional hospitals.  As a result of the establishment of these regional hospitals it may be necessary to close down a hospital on a local authority and a young medical officer, probably only appointed a few years, may claim a pension if we have not some powers such as those proposed in the section.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy MacBride that some compensation for travelling expenses should be paid to an officer, that has been the practice and, please God, it will continue to be the practice that reasonable travelling expenses will be paid.  But, it is an entirely different thing to write that into a Bill because, if you do, you are giving each transferred officer, as a matter of right, power to claim compensation.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, is now disclosing his intentions behind this Bill.  The intention behind the Bill, in view of the remarks made by the Minister, is to transfer all local authority servants in fact to the Civil Service.  It is no argument to say that because something applies for civil servants, it should also apply for local authority servants.  A local authority official joins the local authority service on terms and conditions which apply in a particular area.  A civil servant applies for a position and sits for an examination knowing that if he is appointed the area which the Government administers and which he will have to serve will be the Twenty-Six Counties.  The practice has been that if he is transferred from one area to another it is more than likely that it will be on promotion or, occasionally, punishment.  In the case of the local authority official, however, we are now going to bring about the situation where an official in Waterford can be directed to take up a position in Donegal without any regard whatever to his living circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I do not want the Minister to have any fear that he is being pilloried.  In a debate of this kind, you should not be tied by technical rules because we want to try and get the best form of Bill possible.  In this section, we have a White Paper which sets out the intentions of the Minister, and in this particular case I think it is expedient that I should quote the White Paper reference to the section.  According to the White Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1941, the appropriate Minister may require an officer to resign in certain circumstances, and if he refuses, the Minister may remove him from office.  The power can be exercised only where the Minister is satisfied either that the holder does not possess a qualification necessary for the office or that on account of any alteration in the conditions of service or in the duties of the office, it is in the public interest that the holder should resign.  There is some doubt as to whether the Minister is empowered by the section to require an officer whose office has been abolished to resign.  The amendment proposed in Section 17 of the Bill will remove this doubt.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> If an office has been duly abolished, having regard to Section 24, it is possibly reasonable to ask that the Minister would have power to require the official to resign.  But let us have a look at this section on the powers of resignation.  Is it the Minister's intention to ask power to do this in effect&mdash;abolish the office <i>simpliciter</i>?  I think he has ample powers for abolishing offices and by that process then be able to ask the holder to resign.  Is that what the Minister seeks to do?  If it is, then there is something for the section as it is drafted.  But if it is the Minister's intention to remain within the spirit of Section 24 (1), then I think the drafting of this section needs attention. Let me refer the House to Section 24 (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the holder of an office does not possess a qualification which before the appointment of such holder to such office, has been declared under this part of this Act to be a qualification for such office, or&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, where the man is unqualified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  that, on account of any alteration (whether it has already occurred or is in contemplation) in the conditions of service or the nature or extent of the duties attached to such office, it is in the public interest that the holder of such office should resign therefrom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister has certain powers. Now this section proposes to add a clause (c) that such office should be abolished, and there is no qualification to that.  Let me draw the attention of the House to sub-section (b).  No one will cavil with sub-section (a).  The Minister can only require the officer to resign if, on account of any alteration in the conditions of his service or in the nature and extent of the duties attached to such office, it is in the public interest that such officer should resign.  There is a certain limitation; in other words, under that section the Minister cannot come along and say <Col N="1065" /> there has been a change in conditions and it is in the public interest that he should resign.</P>
    <P>Again, if there is a simple abolition &mdash;and this is one of the ramifications of the code that I am not in a position to deal with in detail just at the moment &mdash;the putting in of (c) to the effect that such office should be abolished on its own brings about the position that the Minister may exercise the powers under Section 24, provided only that such office should be abolished <i>simpliciter.</i> There is no qualification. There is nothing to say under what conditions and so forth.  I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that he should consider this matter between this and the Report Stage.  We are opposing the section, but one thing which would remove the opposition I am making now would be if he did not put in sub-section (c) but inserted instead the very words he has here&mdash;&ldquo;That such office should be abolished&rdquo;&mdash;at the end of sub-section (b) following the word &ldquo;therefrom&rdquo;.  Then the Minister would be able to exercise powers as follows: sub-section (a) as it is at present and then (b):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that, on account of any alteration (whether it has already occurred or is in contemplation) in the conditions of service or the nature and extent of the duties attached to such office, it is in the public interest that the holder of such office should resign therefrom, or that such office should be abolished.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to rush the Minister because we are dealing with a technical point but, if he can accept that, I shall be very grateful.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will forgive me for being suspicious.  I would like the legal gentlemen here to follow the layman's argument based on suspicion.  Section 15 enables the Minister to give additional duties to <Col N="1066" /> any particular office or office holder.  If we pass Section 17 as it is now envisaged a particular officer, because of the additional duties imposed on him under Section 15, may prove to be unqualified for his new position and, if he does not resign, he can be dismissed and the office abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister directs an individual, whether he knows him or not: &ldquo;You will do so and so extra work over and above your ordinary duties.&rdquo;  The officer takes up the duties.  A report reaches the Minister that the man is not carrying out these duties satisfactorily and he is certainly not qualified now for the position to which he was originally appointed plus the additional duties; the Minister says: &ldquo;Very well, get him to resign&rdquo; and, if he does not resign, the Minister will abolish the office.  That is the answer to Sections 15 and 17 as I interpret them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the answer and the Deputy knows very well it is not.  The qualifications for any additional duties which may be imposed under Section 15 will be the very same as they were when he was originally appointed.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Briscoe is perfectly right in his point, but he is late on the section.  I think this does not arise on Section 17.  It arises in point of fact on Section 24 (1) (a) of the 1941 Act.  The Minister might bear that point in mind.  If the Chair will allow a digression, supposing the recalcitrant individual has certain degrees but is not an M.A.O. the Minister can make a regulation relating specifically to that office requiring the degree of M.A.O. and, since the individual concerned has not got that degree, the Minister can then invoke Section 24.  However, that does not arise on this section except in so far as we are dealing with an amendment of the section.  It is nevertheless a point the Minister should bear in mind. I agree with Deputy MacBride that in future we shall have to be very careful in what we do in the way of giving powers here.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with one point and the Minister has generously met that point wholeheartedly.  His attitude is very helpful to the debate.  But there is something more in substance having regard to the section.  The second paragraph in the White Paper in relation to this section states that: &ldquo;This is also intended to facilitate the transfer of officers from one local authority to another.&rdquo;  Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1941, enables the transfer of an officer from one office to another under the same local authority where it is necessary in the public interest to abolish the first office.  The words &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; are incorporated there.  With the setting up of regional authorities and health institutions and the closing down of existing institutions it is necessary to provide for the transfer of officers to the service of other regional authorities.  The proposed amendment also includes provision to permit an officer who, as part of that rearrangement, is asked to take up duty in another locality on the ground that his office has been abolished.  Clearly under this section the Department and the Minister have, I fear, very good reason to anticipate what might be called unreasonable claims or unreasonable attitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be unfair not to <Col N="1068" /> acknowledge that fact.  Therefore, there is a question again, as we had before, of what is the way to give the Minister sufficient power to deal with a situation reasonably and guard against giving him excessive power which, in principle, can be exercised and which, in principle, is bad.  Again, I fear that, in over-anxiety to cover the legitimate needs and demands of the administration in this matter, the wording of this section, particularly in the amendment to be added to Section 24 is objectionable.  I must join with Deputy MacBride and say how impossible it is in debate to deal reasonably with Bills when they are presented to us in this referred form.  It is practically impossible to be intelligent if we get legislation by amendment.</P>

That exasperation on my part was prompted by the fact that I have to relate sub-section (5) to be added at the end of an already voluminous section&mdash;which, incidentally, occupies practically one and a half pages of the Statute Book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a matter of fact, it is impossible to try and relate these sections logically, talking in this House like this.  However, what it means is that in the 1941 Act&mdash;which some Deputies here have scarified for the powers it has given to the Executive, and with some of which scarification I would agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This particular safeguard read, if I am reading the provision right, on my feet: &ldquo;Where the position of such holder would, in the opinion of the Minister, not be materially altered to his detriment if he were transferred from the first office to such office....&rdquo; It is impossible to explain it here now. Will the Minister accept my simple statement that there was a safeguard for an officer if shifting him around was to be to his detriment?  What have we?&mdash;something which says that something which would be clearly to his detriment is not to be to his detriment within the meaning of the previously referred to provision.  In other words, the fact that the duties of another office are to be performed at a distance from the place or places in which the duties of the first office were performed would not be capable of being regarded as rendering the position of the office holder materially <Col N="1070" /> altered to his detriment, if the appropriate Minister is satisfied that neither the local authority under whom the officer was employed nor the local authority offering the other office are in a position to offer an alternative office in the same place or places in close proximity thereto.

      <P>There is nothing here at the moment.  We are dealing with legislation and that construction is possible within the terms of this legislation&mdash;and it is on these grounds I am objecting to it.  Surely, in actual physical and material fact, the removal <Col N="1071" /> of an officer or the causing of an officer to be removed&mdash;I will not even specify places; I will say distances&mdash;a matter of 50 or 100 miles (50 miles is not too far) is to his detriment, no matter how we like it.  Supposing any of us are suddenly ordered to move 50 miles away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly&mdash;in the material sense&mdash;to his detriment. Here we are using the old dodge to declare that in notion or contemplation of law it is not to his detriment.  That is what we are doing.  Frankly, I do not think it is necessary so to do and I think it is not satisfactory.  I think every officer, and one can understand their case, would say that that section should be made to read that it would be mandatory on the Minister to regard it as to their detriment.  They would make the case&mdash;and nobody can say it would be unreasonable of them to make the case&mdash;that such removals are to their detriment and that cognisance should be taken of them as such. For instance, even Army officers who are transferred from one barracks to another have considered and made representations that it was to their detriment&mdash;I think Deputy Briscoe or some other Deputy mentioned certain punitive measures which involves shifting people around.  They would ask to have such removals regarded as to their detriment and I say they would not be unreasonable.  On the other hand, there is a certain reasonableness from the Minister's point of view.  If you are going to have something defining &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; could it not be put in in such a way that the Minister could have power to consider every individual case on its merits? We are dealing with office holders; there are not so many and it is not such a load on the Minister.  They should get more than an omnibus sweep out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>According to that, the Minister himself could not even regard <Col N="1072" /> it, no matter how equitable in any particular case, as being to the detriment of the officer if he was satisfied that neither the local authority under which he was employed nor the other local authority are in a position to offer alternative employment in the same place.  The Minister is tying his own hands.  He says he has power at the moment to consider individual cases and it will be to his detriment if this goes through.  The Minister will be tied down as well as anybody else and he will not be in a position, for the purpose of making some amends or compensation to the officer concerned, to regard it as to his detriment, no matter what the equity&mdash;that is, if I read the sub-section correctly.  If I am wrong, the Minister will tell me, and I will accept his word.</P>
      <P>The latter part of this is objectionable, too, because it makes it worse.  The latter part means the Minister has to ask himself this question: can the local authority to which this man belongs, employ him where he was or near where he was or can the local authority offering the other office employ him?  If the answer to both these questions is in the negative then it is not to his detriment.  Is that not the position?  I am wondering whether the Minister's draft is not going a little bit too far.  In this, as I say, the office holders themselves would seek deletion of everything after &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 42 and the substitution of the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;shall not be capable of being&rdquo;.  I will not go to the extent of positively pressing that amendment on the Minister because I have not the facilities for looking into all the ramifications of a matter like that.  At the same time, that is their point of view, and I think it is fair to advert to it. Would the Minister be good enough to look into this matter again?  I will not ask for any undertaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where they are.  I know there are some contemplated in Leinster which have not been fixed, and we are dealing to-day with a Bill that will concern not only pure local government but that will concern itself with health and social welfare.  I certainly feel that we could easily legislate now in a form that would create injustice later and at the same time the House would have to come and decide to amend this legislation because of the injustice which followed.  It appears to me to be reasonable to suggest that until you have completed dividing up the country and your geographical description of each region, you should not legislate now in the dark that a man is bound to go wherever he is sent within these regions.  You could have a whole province regarded as a region.  I think the Minister will agree that this is going a bit too far and is unfair.  I certainly object very much to saying now: &ldquo;I am going to fix the terms and conditions for future employment of certain officers for regions or <Col N="1074" /> for services in regions not yet agreed, not yet, if you like, even envisaged.&rdquo; I think Deputy Davin ought to see the sense of that.  Deputy Davin ought to agree that it is not fair to be fixing terms and conditions for a job not yet specified.  At least you have to know what the job is before you fix your terms and conditions.  I appeal to Deputy Davin to use his influence with the Minister to see that this, to me, offensive section is postponed, at any rate until we see what the regions are.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin is taking the view on what you call hope.  I do not know which officers are going to be found unsuitable under this Bill and either their office or themselves put out of existence.  I am not prepared to argue that it is fair to legislate terms and conditions of employment for a job not yet fixed.  I do not think Deputy Davin with all his experience in the trade unions would agree that he would go to discuss terms and conditions of employment for a job not yet specified.  Surely this is on the same parallel.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw that particular section at least until we see what the terms and conditions are going to be for those who are going to be affected when the new regions are completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain that I did not refer to Deputy Briscoe as briefed upon the point of view he put forward here, so that he need not feel any sense of grievance with regard to the remark I made.  However, I do agree with the mover of the amendment that it would be to the detriment of an officer if for some reason or other he were removed from one place to another, particularly say from Meath to Donegal.  But at the same time, if this thing has been going on without official authority for a number of years, surely there would be a very little objection to having it made legal at the present time, because if everything in the Act is not made watertight does it not follow that some time or other those things will be challenged and it will be very awkward, shall we say, for somebody to find that they are being paid moneys, or that something is being done for which there was no legal authority?  I would like the Minister to consider this before he finally writes it into the Bill and at the same time I think there is a certain amount of justification for something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the turn the discussion has taken I would like to ask the Minister one question. Deputy Briscoe mentioned regional activities.  One of the difficulties in this amendment to which I would like to draw attention is that it appears to me that it could be used to compel an officer whose office was abolished or made redundant under some provision to accept a similar post in a county or a district at a distance, somewhere remote, without reference to regional organisation and that this could bring about a situation like that, <i>simpliciter.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law as it stands.  A local authority officer may be shifted from one area of the local authority to another area of the same local authority.  For instance, an officer may be transferred from Bundoran&mdash;as the law stands&mdash;to Moville, <Col N="1076" /> a distance of 100 miles, but may not be transferred from Bundoran to Sligo, a distance of 20 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That only bears out the Minister's problem, and I sympathise with him and I want to meet that type of problem, but I submit there is a provision with regard to detriment, and it surely is to a man's detriment to have these things happen.  As I see it, the clause could be used to compel a man to accept a similar post in another county.</P>

However, I am quite open to conviction&mdash;it may be quite necessary as some local authorities might be inclined to abuse their rights but it does seem to have the effect in the ultimate analysis of reducing the powers of local authorities to deal with their own officers and vesting that power in the Minister. The effect of it is to reduce the power of the local authority and transfer more power to the hands of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The net result of all <Col N="1078" /> that is to take away &mdash;the House may be surprised to learn&mdash;the right of local authorities to suspend officers and to vest that right exclusively in the hands of the Minister.  Because, as I read Section 27 of the 1941 Act as it is to be amended, it will read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Whenever in respect of the holder of an office under a local authority there is, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, reason to believe that such holder has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of such office or has misconducted himself in relation to such office or is unfit to hold such office, the appropriate Minister may suspend such holder from the performance of the duties of such office while such alleged failure, misconduct or unfitness is being inquired into and the disciplinary action (if any) to be taken in regard thereto is being determined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that the effect of the section is to take away from the local authority the powers which they had to suspend an officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

It is not fair for the Minister to say that sub-section (m) is a right which they have got in substitution for all rights being lost.  The amendment previously discussed, to which the Minister refers, purely allows a manager to deal with an offender of a very minor nature and, because he is getting that right, all the rest of the rights are forfeited.</P>

    <P>Might I voice another protest?  I am afraid I have not got a copy of the <Col N="1079" /> White Paper available.  I am talking from recollection of what the White Paper says in regard to Section 18. Bearing in mind that the one effective purpose of Section 18 is to deprive the local authorities of the right to suspend an officer, I think I am right in saying that the White Paper does not mention that and conceals it most carefully. I think that is a typical instance of the way in which a White Paper should not be produced in the House. Obviously, the purpose of that portion of the White Paper is not to inform the House but to mislead the House as to the effect of that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a perfectly good argument for adopting Section 18.  I have not heard of it.  I am suspicious of it by reason of the way in which it is presented, in which its effect is concealed both in the section and in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with some of those Deputies who say the lawyers take up time but this is forced upon us by the particular structure of this Bill.  We cannot disentangle it. Let me go back to Section 14 (m). Section 14 says that Section 19 of the Act of 1941 is amended.  Deputy MacBride will recollect that on Section 19 he pointed out that Section 19 applied to remuneration. &ldquo;The appropriate Minister may for all or any of the following purposes make regulations applying to office holders and their offices.&rdquo;  Then it says: &ldquo;providing for the imposition by local authorities of suspensions from the performance of duties, the non-payment of remuneration during the continuance of the suspensions and upon the determination thereof and forfeiture in whole or in part, etc.&rdquo; Taking the first, in spite of what was said when we argued it the last day, the regulations may provide for the imposition by local authorities on holders of suspensions from performance of duties, the non-payment of remuneration.  Now, we pointed out on that occasion that this short-term disciplinary suspension was a very nebulous thing that seemed to appear <Col N="1080" /> there.  Am I correct in that?  I think it is not at all clear that Section 14, sub-section (m) confers on local authorities the power of suspension. All he can do is provide for the imposition by local authorities on holders of suspension, the non-payment of remuneration. In other words, for the operation of that section, it appears to me that there is a condition precedent there that there must be a suspension there already.  Am I right in that or am I wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>And non-payment of salary during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister appreciate the point?  Section 14 (m), as far as we can see it here, provides for a question of remuneration for suspended office holders.  In this section the Minister is taking away the power in Section 27 of suspending officers in the sense that it was there already. Now, let me take the White Paper to which Deputy MacBride referred.  The White Paper says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1941, provides that the appropriate Minister or the local authority can suspend an officer but only the appropriate Minister can terminate a suspension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is statement number one.  Then it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The suspension by local authorities of officers will henceforth be dealt with in accordance with the regulations to be made under paragraph (m) of Section 14 of this Bill. The reasons for this change are set out in the note on that section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the reason for that change we have what I have said in regard to Section 14.  But, take the effect of this amendment we are dealing with in Section 18.  I am going to delete the words &ldquo;of such local authority.&rdquo;  We then have:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever in respect of the holder of an office under a local authority there is, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, reason to believe that such holder has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" />&mdash;or is unfit to hold such office&mdash;&rdquo; and the qualifying word apparently is taken out there&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such local authority or the appropriate Minister may suspend ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this case, according to this, the local authority can only suspend if the Minister is of opinion in a certain way. Am I right in that?  I would like to get that clear.  I wonder would some other Deputies help me in this.  Am I right in saying that as a result of this amendment in Section 18, the effect will be that the local authority, if it can suspend at all, such local authority could only do it with the consent of the appropriate Minister and then, if the words in brackets &ldquo;(where those words occur secondly&rdquo;) mean anything, the local authorities' power of suspension is completely removed by Section 18.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <P>I know I am being an encumbrance, but I want to get this on the record.  I want to have it on the record intelligibly, but I am afraid I am failing to make myself clear.  Up to the present moment local authorities have had power of suspension conferred on them under Section 27 of the 1941 Act.  These powers are now to be removed from them by the Minister. He says he is giving compensation under Section 14 of the Bill; that they will have compensatory powers in that.  I have categorically to contradict that impression.  According to Section 14 of the Bill, taking in its context Section 19 of the 1941 Act, the appropriate Minister may make an Order within the terms of Section 19 to provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... for the imposition by local authorities on holders of suspensions from performance of duties (including short-term disciplinary suspensions, not exceeding seven days), the non-payment of remuneration during the continuance of the suspensions and, upon the termination thereof, the forfeiture (in whole or in part), payment or disposal otherwise of remuneration which would, but for the suspensions, have been paid during the periods thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is paragraph (m).  I would ask the Minister to look at the wording of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>I accept it.  The Minister has made a very ingenious point of law.  There is a very good case for argument in the courts but we are not in court.  Let us clear it so that it will not be just an argument in court. The Minister is quite right: it is capable of interpretation in the case of holders as being holders <i>simpliciter</i> not holders of suspension, if we innocently read it as any person reading ordinary English would read it. The imposition of suspensions on holders is what the Minister is saying. I congratulate him because it is open to that interpretation.  But I think the Minister should make it quite clear.</P>

      <P>Go back to paragraph (j) of Section 19 of the 1941 Act and you will find &ldquo;holders&rdquo; again. Then, again, if you refer to paragraph (j) of Section 14 of the Bill you will find it refers to &ldquo;holders&rdquo; not &ldquo;holders of suspensions&rdquo; just &ldquo;holders&rdquo; of offices.</P>

      <P>May I point out that Section 19 of the local Government Act of 1941 empowers the Minister to make regulations, and, of course, amendments of regulations.  That is all it does.  If the Minister, by Section 18 of the Bill, amends Section 27 of the Act of 1941 in such a way that only the Minister can suspend, surely he can now make a regulation under Section 19, as amended, in contravention of the statute law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respects that is a paragraph of a section which empowers the Minister to make a regulation.  Section 19 of the 1941 Act prescribes that the appropriate Minister may make regulations.  Then the different paragraphs deal with the types of regulation.  There is nothing in the paragraph more than the type of regulation.  Now the Minister says that the appropriate Minister may make a regulation which is in contravention of Section 27 which is amended by Section 18 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple. Section 14 of the Bill provides that Section 19 of the 1941 Act is amended, and goes on to provide for the imposition by local authorities on holders, etc.  Remember it says, &ldquo;holders&rdquo; not &ldquo;holders of offices&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Grading of Bacon Pigs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I asked the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether he is aware of the general dissatisfaction prevailing in regard to the rigid grading of bacon pigs, and, if so, whether he will have an inquiry held regarding the working of the system to ascertain whether the reduced prices paid for heavier pigs are passed on to the consuming public in all cases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me, in reply, that he was not aware that there is any foundation for the statement made in the first part of the question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position is that the purchase of pigs by bacon factories and pork exporters is on a freely competitive basis and the prices paid for the various weights of bacon pigs reflect the preference for lean bacon both on the home and export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> With regard to the second part of the question, retail prices do not come within my province, but I would point out they have been the subject of a recent inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body and are controlled by Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel sure that this House and the Minister agree that the pig and bacon industry is a very important one in rural Ireland to-day, as many of our farmers and, indeed, many of our cottiers have to depend to a large extent for their livelihood on the pig industry.  I maintained at question time to-day that these pig producers are being exploited by the bacon factories and, as a result, the bacon factories are reaping a rich financial harvest.</P>
    <P>In reply to a supplementary question, the Minister made it very clear that a preference should exist as between the different grades of pigs; we all agree that that position should obtain. The reference in my question is to the rigid grading system that obtains and it is on that system that the bacon factories cash in and make their big profits.  Now every Deputy knows that this was a very difficult year so far as pig production was concerned. It is agreed by all that for the summer months and the early months of the year there was not a single penny profit made by pig producers.  They were producing pigs uneconomically and, that being the position, I believe there is an obligation on the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, to ensure that these people are treated with justice and given fair play.</P>
    <P>In raising this matter to-night, I want to make it quite clear that I regard the present Minister for Agriculture as as good a Minister as we could have.  I believe he is most interested in the pig and bacon industry and that he is endeavouring to be as helpful as he possibly can to promote the interests of pig producers generally.  It is in that spirit that I raise this matter and not in a spirit of trying to attack the Minister or find some fault with his administration. <Col N="1088" /> Any criticism I have to make of the Department of Agriculture so far as pig producers are concerned is entirely constructive.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to-day when the Minister informed me that he was not aware that any dissatisfaction exists. I believe that he himself produces pigs and he must be a very fortunate man indeed if he is not dissatisfied with the prices he has received over the past few months from the bacon factories unless, of course, being who he is, the bacon factories treat him generously and give him some special consideration. In my opinion that could be the only reason why the Minister is not aware of the grave dissatisfaction that exists.</P>
    <P>He informed me in reply to-day that pigs are bought on a competitive basis.  Does not everyone know there is no such thing as competition in the pig market?  Has not all that been done away with long ago?  The pigs are bought as the bacon factories desire they should be bought.  They lay down the terms and the producers have no say whatsoever in relation to those terms.  I would like to inform the Minister, if he is not already aware of it, that when a pig producer in County Cork&mdash;I am sure the same applies in Roscommon&mdash;has pigs for the market, he sends them to the bacon factory and he must have them there at a particular time; they are graded; they are weighed; the price is marked down and the producer has no say whatsoever as to their grade, weight or price.  If he disagrees with the weight or with the price he is told to take his pigs away.  That is the position that obtains in every factory. I am convinced that in most factories there is a ring or combine working against the interests of the producers. Do not for one moment think there is such a thing as competition in the pig market to-day, for it is not there.</P>
    <P>I have received from various pig producers, mainly small farmers and cottiers, many letters of complaint about the way they are being treated by the bacon factories in Cork.  These are all responsible people and, having examined these letters and understanding the problem, I am satisfied their complaints are justified.  I have <Col N="1089" /> been asked during the past few months to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister.  I do so to-night in the strongest possible language at my command because I have faith in the Minister.  I believe he will inquire into the allegations I make on behalf of pig producers all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now the consuming public has just as big a complaint because everyone knows that, despite the fact that there was a sharp decline in the price of pigs at the factories, particularly during the spring and summer months of this year, no such reductions were passed on to the consuming public.  It is a peculiar position that while farmers and pig producers are selling pigs at an average of 1/5 per lb. the consuming public here in Dublin City and in many provincial centres have on an average to pay 3/6 per lb. for bacon.  Of course, in many cases, for the better cuts the price was 4/2, 4/4 and 4/6 a lb.  Is it not a function of the Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to inquire where this differentiation went to?  Into whose pockets did the difference of almost 2/-a lb. go?  Surely it must have gone to the bacon factories.  If it did not go to them it went to the wholesalers and then if it did not go to the wholesalers it went to the retailers.  I am informed by many shopkeepers that they have got no benefit whatsoever from this system.</P>
    <P>I understand that if you sell a pig weighing 9 st. 13 lb. to a bacon factory you get one price and if you sell a pig of 10 st. 1 lb. to the bacon factory you get another price.  In the summer months, there was a difference of as much as 10/- between the prices of two such pigs.  I should like to know if the Minister ever bought a 10 st. 1 lb. pig as against a 9 st. 13 lb. pig because in no shop in Dublin City or throughout the country was there anything such as grade A, B and C pigs: you paid the very same price for the pigs.  The only price differentiation was in relation to the different cuts.  I believe the Minister is aware of that fact and, if he is not, he should be aware of it.  This <Col N="1090" /> rigid system is working against the producer and, at the same time, it is of no advantage whatsoever to the consumer.</P>
    <P>For the past two years, the Cork County Committee of Agriculture have discussed this problem.  We asked the bacon factories in Cork to receive a deputation from the committee of agriculture with a view to greater co-operation between the bacon curers and the pig producers.  We asked that, in fairness, the bacon curers should make known their prices every day of the week.  We got no co-operation whatsoever from these people.  They told us it was no concern of ours even though the Cork County Committee of Agriculture represents the agricultural interests of the county.  These people were able to ignore that body because of the monopoly they have in the bacon trade at the present time and because of the ring and combines which they have formed between themselves.  This has been going on at least during the year 1954.  Complaints are being made all over and, indeed, many individual complaints have been made to the Department of Agriculture.  I object, then, to be told here in the middle of November that the Minister is not aware of any dissatisfaction whatsoever among pig producers.  Is it not quite evident that they are dissatisfied when, during the past two months, there has been a decline of 50 per cent. of the pig population of this country? If my figures are correct, the number of pigs has declined by about 50 per cent. in the past two months because the pig producers are now satisfied they cannot deal with the bacon curers. They feel that the bacon curers have complete mastery of the position and, consequently, that they will not get any satisfaction.  The result is that the pig population is declining and unless adequate steps are taken to safeguard the producer it will dwindle still further.  It is mainly on this line that I raised this question on the Adjournment to-night.</P>
    <P>I have given to the Minister, briefly, a statement of what I believe is the position so far as the pig industry is concerned.  My information is based on the most reliable sources.  It comes from pig producers.  I know hundreds <Col N="1091" /> of them.  I know a good deal about pigs, about the difficulty of producing them, about costings, and so forth.  I say here as a Labour representative that the man who produces a pig is entitled, as a self-employed person, to a fair and just deal&mdash;just as much so as any other self-employed man or wage-earner is.  He is not getting that square deal at the present time.  I believe the obligation is on the Department of Agriculture to see to his interests.  The Minister may, in his reply, state that the position is improving somewhat. The position is improving somewhat because the number of pigs is declining. The bacon factories now know that if they continue to pursue the policy which they pursued when pigs were in plentiful supply&mdash;particularly during the summer months&mdash;they will have to close down altogether.  Part of my question seeks to have an inquiry held into the working of the system to ascertain whether the reduced prices paid for heavier pigs are passed on to the consuming public in all cases.  In the circumstances, it was reasonable to demand this inquiry.  The consuming public were entitled, when the prices were drastically reduced, to a reduction in the prices which they had to pay for bacon to the shopkeepers and others.  So, both the producer of bacon in this country and the consumer got a raw deal&mdash;and it is the middle people who are doing well out of this business.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister tell the House his opinion of the position.  I want him to state clearly whether, in his opinion, the bacon curers are giving a fair and square deal to the pig producers and also whether or not he is satisfied that the margins of profit of wholesalers and retailers are justifiable. Further, I want him to state clearly what he intends to do to enable this industry to continue&mdash;an industry which is giving so much self-employment to many of our people and which is so helpful to small farmers and cottiers and other people in the country.</P>

I did not know that Deputy M.P. Murphy had a question down on the Adjournment and he has very kindly given me some of his time, We had a cold, airy-fairy dismissal by the Minister to-day at question time of any responsibility on his part towards the consumer.  It is this passing of the buck between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, over the years, that has led to this dissatisfaction between producer and consumer. Every time the price of an agricultural commodity was questioned, the Department of Agriculture said that the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to deal with prices and, on the other hand, the Department of Industry and Commerce said that it is the function of the Department of Agriculture to deal with prices of agricultural commodities.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy M.P. Murphy has raised this matter in the manner in which he did.  I should like to add something still further for the Minister's education or to enlighten his ignorance in regard to the dissatisfaction which exists by pointing out to him that during the weeks in the middle of the summer when bacon prices to the producers reached a low level, there was absolutely little or no reduction to the consumer and, for once, the retailer did not get it either. I have here factory prices quoted by one of the bacon factories to retailers for three weeks.  It is significant that when they would reduce one particular side of bacon or particular type of cut they increased the price of another one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have here for August 23rd: Wiltshire leanest, 300/-; Gammonless leanest, 300/-; and then you have for <Col N="1093" /> August 30th: Wiltshire leanest, 295/-; Gammonless leanest, 302/-.  I might point out that in the three weeks when the price of pigs to the producer steadily decreased, the price of lard from the bacon factory was 140/-, 150/- and 160/-.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the consumers I would like to add to Deputy Murphy's appeal for a public inquiry.  If the bacon factories are all right an inquiry cannot hurt them.  There is a need for such an inquiry to end dissatisfaction. I submit to the Minister that not only have the factories exploited the producer in a most despicable manner this year, but they certainly have not given either the consumer or the retailer any benefit.  There is not a single part of the pig they have not sold except perhaps the squeak, and they will probably sell that to Radio Éireann.  They sell the hide, the bone meal, the tongue, the feet, the head, the sausages; they are all priced here and all the prices fluctuate.  When they are compelled, possibly because prices are widely known, to reduce some parts, the other parts increase.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy is quite right when he says the pig industry is very important to this country and he and I have a right to look back with pride upon the fact that it was the pig and bacon agreement&mdash;which the Government he and I supported in 1951 made in May, 1951&mdash;that has secured the pig industry as a prosperous industry in this country ever since.  I said there was no general dissatisfaction in regard to the grading of pigs.  I do not think there is because our farmers have come to realise that there is no place for the fat pig any more.  The production of the fat pig in this country means ruin for the farmer who produces it.  Our farmers are as up-to-date and as progressive as any farmers in the world; they have accepted that fact and they are at present doing, in my opinion, an <Col N="1094" /> excellent job in producing and supplying to the factories the vast majority of their pigs in a suitable condition for conversion into top grade bacon.</P>
      <P>It is true there was dissatisfaction for about six weeks during the period of peak production and I do not complain of that, but the dissatisfaction amongst the producers in Ireland was nothing compared to the dissatisfaction amongst the producers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We were able to boast that every pig tendered to a factory in Ireland was taken, slaughtered and paid for at a period when in Northern Ireland and all over Great Britain one pig out of every five tendered by the farmers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to their factories was sent home.  Deputies should recollect, therefore, that we were able to take, slaughter and pay for 100 per cent. of the pigs offered in this country at a period when we were being tendered up to 40,000 pigs a week and when one of the largest proprietary factories in this country, controlling 18 per cent. of our total slaughter capacity had walked in to me and announced that they were going to close down during the whole period of peak supply.  In spite of that we accepted, slaughtered and paid for a greater number of pigs per week than at any time in our previous recorded history.  I do not blame the producer for feeling a certain dissatisfaction. When they know the facts I think they will realise that their fortune compared with that of the producer in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the real solution of the problem raised by Deputy Murphy here to-day?  There is only one real solution and that is that the farmers should cure their own pigs.  Until the bacon industry of this country is controlled by the co-operative movement representative of the farmers who produce pigs, we will have recurrent cause for complaint. If Deputy Murphy inquires amongst his neighbours he will find I did not content myself by giving nothing more than good advice.  I have offered help and encouragement to the farmers of West Cork, to the farmers of Limerick, to the farmers of Tipperary <Col N="1095" /> and to the pig producers all over Ireland to undertake the co-operative processing of their own pigs so that they can ensure, through the management of their own factories, that substantial justice is done to the farmers who produce pigs.</P>
    <P>Let there be no illusion about this. My job is to get for the producers of pigs in this country the best price I can get for them wherever they get it. So long as I am in this job that is what I am going to do and nobody will stop me doing that.  That is what I am here to do and I am doing it, and not only for a selection of the pigs produced but for all the pigs produced.  Deputy Murphy and I ought to boast of the fact that it was we made the agreement that made it possible to do that and it was something our predecessors were never able to do.  There is something our predecessors were very glad to have, that is, their feather bed to lie on.  We provided the tick, put the feather in it and they lay on it for the last three years.  Let us do a little jumping on that feather bed because it was we made it.  It is because of what we have done that the pig population of this country is standing at as high a figure as it ever stood.  Do not let us forget when we took over in 1948 there were two ounces of bacon per person available in this country; we were not able to provide bacon for our own people.  Now we are able to produce all our people require and ship hundreds of tons abroad at prices that enable us to pay the pig producer of West Cork up to 240/- a cwt. for every pig he brings in.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be put into the position of defending the proprietary bacon factories in this country.  I have got enough persecution from the proprietary bacon factories&mdash;not all of them but some of them&mdash;to make me refuse with vehemence the task of <Col N="1096" /> being their champion in this House. Nevertheless facts are facts and it is true to say that the most recent figure I have suggests that prices ranging from 240/- down to 200/- is being paid for pigs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;according to grade and that during the same time prices for bacon have fluctuated between 300/-and 274/- a cwt. according to quality. You have in one factory 300/- being quoted for leanest Wiltshires, 296/- for lean sides, 280/- for what they call prime sides and 274/- for stout sides. There is a relationship between the prices charged by the bacon factories and the prices paid for pigs, but I will go this far with Deputy Murphy&mdash;I am not satisfied the producer got a fair deal during the whole of the period to which he referred, but I am satisfied that the only effective way to put an end to these abuses is not to hold futile inquiries, because I know without any inquiry that the only effective way to put an end to this abuse is for the pig producers to cure their own bacon and take control of the bacon industry. Until that is done the producers in this country may expect to get, from time to time, a raw deal.</P>
      <P>In so far as within me lies, when the attempt to give them a raw deal is being made, under existing circumstances I will endeavour to make it possible to cook the deal and prevent it from being raw any longer.  But there is no use in pretending I can do it effectively under existing conditions &mdash;I cannot.  There is only one effective method to prevent the sort of thing of which Deputy Murphy complains and that is to have the farmers cure their own bacon.  The sooner they do that the better for us all.</P>
