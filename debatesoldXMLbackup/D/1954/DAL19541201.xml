      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the acreage of barley-feeding varieties grown this year was 74,700 acres.  It must be pointed out that this estimate relates to the variety of barley grown and not to its subsequent usage.</P>
      <P>It is not possible from the available data to give the information asked for in the second part of the Deputy's question, but it is very roughly estimated that of this year's barley crop about 25,000 tons have been sold for feeding purposes.  The actual varieties of barley included in this estimate cannot be distinguished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that as in many other areas there is a shortage of hand-won turf in the areas from which the Aran Islanders normally obtain their supplies. Adequate supplies of altertive fuels are, however, available and there does not, therefore, appear to be any immediate danger of a fuel famine on the islands.  I am informed by Bord na Móna that a quantity of machine-won turf can be made available from their works at Attymon, County Galway, and Bord na Móna will be prepared, if required, to provide a supply through local fuel merchants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been asked what steps Bord na Móna are taking, but I am saying now, and <Col N="1274" /> presumably my reply will be conveyed through the Press, that Bord na Móna are making supplies available from a County Galway depot for use by the Aran Islanders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest should be done?  Neither Bord na Móna nor my Department has any request to the effect that fuel is wanted.  I have no request to that effect from anybody.

Bord na Móna has recently advised the committee that, following a detailed survey of the area and discussions with the Land Commission, it was found that the area of bog which would be available after the needs of the Land Commission for turbary allotment for domestic requirements had been satisfied would not be sufficient to provide adequate supplies for a power station.  The possibility of developing the area for machine-won turf production for ordinary commercial sale is being examined by Bord na Móna but I am not in a position at this stage to give any indication of what the result of this examination may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. As regards the second part, a paymaster may spread a payment over more than one day if he cannot reasonably complete it in a single day, but he would not thereby be entitled to additional remuneration as each payment is treated as one unit irrespective of the number of days taken to finish it.  More than one unit payment in a week may become necessary as a work progresses.  The necessity for this is not determined by the paymaster and has not so far arisen on the Corrib/ Clare arterial drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>Reasonable travelling expenses are allowed for all journeys necessarily made in disbursing payments.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report referred to.  There is no record in my Department of any complaints against the staff in regard to this matter and I am satisfied that such complaints would have been made if there was any ground for them.  The institution has been inspected regularly by officers of my Department and they would be aware of any well-founded cause for complaint.  It should be remembered that to nurses residing in an institution, the institution is their home for the time being and that they are entitled to entertain their friends there from time to time in the same reasonable way as they would if they were living at home.  They work hard for the benefit of their patients and require at least the same degree of relaxation and recreation as any other section of the community.</P>

    <P>I may add that the nurses concerned have appealed to me for protection against such unjustifiable charges and that I have told them that there is nothing I can do in the matter and that they must continue to rely on the sense of fair play of the members of the authority which employs them and that, happily, such sense of fair play is rarely absent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I was wondering whether, in sub-section (1), paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (iii) dealing with a misdemeanour committed outside the State, that is too trivial a matter for which a solicitor might be in danger of losing his professional practice within the country, or whether it would be a subject that the disciplinary committee set up by the society will treat with due discretion. It is just a question I pose to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this was raised on the Second Reading also and I considered it, as I undertook, since that time.  I put this particular case as an example to the House and to the Deputy in particular who has raised this question again.  Suppose a solicitor practising here goes across the water to England and commits what is an offence against the criminal law, a misdemeanour, surely he should not be entitled to come back here and practise, or at least he should be subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of his own body in a matter of that kind.  I think it is for the purpose of dealing with interests of that nature that this particular section was put in. Obviously a solicitor who has committed misconduct outside this country should not be entitled to practise his profession unless the disciplinary committee or the Chief Justice so thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Deputy Lynch, if he considers the matter of this particular paragraph he is raising in conjunction with paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 14, will see that under that paragraph one of the matters that may be inquired into is if a solicitor has been guilty of misconduct tending to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute.  Even if paragraph 3 were not in the Bill as it stands, that particular provision would enable the disciplinary committee to take into account the very matter that is specifically referred to in the sub-paragraph to which the Deputy appears to take exception.  I think it is far better for solicitors to have their attention directed to the fact that if they engage in criminal activities outside the country they may be subjected to the discipline of their own body.  I think it can be left to the committee and to the Chief Justice on appeal to see that nothing untoward will arise.</P>

      <P>(2) Rules under this section may provide, in particular, for extending the period for the furnishing of any affidavit or document, or for receiving an application or affidavit notwithstanding any irregularity in its form, where it appears to the disciplinary committee to be just to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this is to enable the disciplinary committee when they consider fit to do so to extend the period for furnishing affidavits or documents and to waive any irregularity in the form of the affidavit.  This power is possessed by the present statutory committee and every court of justice because injury may be done if the court or tribunal were bound by a merely technical regulation to rule out some document which they believed should in the interests of justice be allowed in.  It has been suggested that, while the disciplinary committee under the section, as it now stands, would <Col N="1311" /> have the power to dispense with any of their own rules in the interests of justice they would have to observe a statutory requirement, and they would also have to reject an affidavit if there was the slightest technical irregularity in its form.  This amendment will remove any doubts on that point.</P>

      <P>and shall also cause the notice to be published in such other manner as the disciplinary committee may direct.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to authorise the disciplinary committee to publish the notice, in addition to publishing it in the <i>Irish Oifigúil</i>, in any newspaper, periodical or other publication if the disciplinary committee deem it proper to do so.  The point there is, that while <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> is an official publication, very few people read it and it is thought that people generally should be informed of the fact that a solicitor has been struck off the rolls, so that they will not go to him or permit him to practise.</P>

      <P>(2) An appeal shall also lie to the Chief Justice against the refusal of the disciplinary committee to suspend the operation of an order under Section 18.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 12 which gives the disciplinary committee power to suspend the operation of any of their orders pending an appeal to the Chief Justice.  The new sub-section which it is now proposed to insert in Section 23 entitles a solicitor who is aggrieved by a refusal of the committee to suspend an order to appeal to the Chief Justice against the refusal.  Deputies will remember that there was power to suspend the order made by the disciplinary committee and this allows an appeal against a refusal by the disciplinary committee to suspend the order.  In other words, if the order made by the disciplinary committee was to strike a solicitor off the rolls and the disciplinary committee refused to put a stay upon that order, the solicitor could thereupon appeal immediately to the Chief Justice asking for a stay pending a full hearing of the appeal by the Chief Justice.  It is proper that that safeguard should be put in for solicitors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 15, to add at the end of the sub-section &ldquo;Such consent shall not be withheld where the two apprentices are the children of the solicitor or where the second apprentice is the child of the solicitor and the first apprentice has been apprenticed with the solicitor for not less than two years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to retain a right that I think a solicitor has at the present time to apprentice <Col N="1315" /> two of his children at the same time to him as a solicitor.  I agree that there is in the second sub-section a provision whereby the society can give consent to a solicitor to have more than two apprentices under special circumstances but I submit that there should be no question of a solicitor who has two sons or a son and daughter whom he wants to apprentice to his own profession in his own office having to go to the society to get that consent.  I suggest that there should be an absolute right in the case of such a man to have his sons or his son and daughter, or his daughters, for that matter, apprenticed, if he wishes, without let or hindrance on the part of anybody.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware of circumstances in which it would be awkward for a solicitor, having two sons growing up who were near the same age, both of whom wanted to become solicitors.  He certainly could apprentice one but in the case of the second son, unless he got the consent of the society, as the section sets out, he would not be able to apprentice that son in his own office.  I think it is plain and obvious that he could not very well apprentice his son in the office of another solicitor if it was in the ordinary country town.  Even in Cork City it could hardly be done.  It could be done but the other solicitor who was to take the second son would not be too well disposed towards doing it.  Even in Dublin it would be difficult for a solicitor to apprentice his son to an office other than his own.  Therefore, I suggest that it should be an absolute right, not depending on the consent of the society.</P>
    <P>The second point in the amendment provides for a case where a man has a son who, having made up his mind about his future, decides not to become a solicitor and in the meantime somebody approaches that solicitor to take on somebody else and he does so and his own son within two years changes his mind and desires to become a solicitor.  I again suggest that that solicitor should have the right, without the consent of anybody, to apprentice that son to his own office.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would make this section more clear.  I think that under sub-section (2) provision can be made by regulation for ascertaining the fitness or capacity of solicitors to take apprentices and to teach such apprentices.  I do not see any provision&mdash;perhaps there is, but I do not see it&mdash;for appeal.  I presume it is the society that will presume the fitness of a solicitor to take and teach apprentices.  I would think there should be provision to have it looked into by someone else.</P>

I would imagine it is such cases that are envisaged in this.  I would agree the regulations should give notice to solicitors, but there is no provision here for appeals.</P>

      <P>This amendment was submitted to cover the case of a solicitor who has been in the whole-time service of the State.  Under the previous provisions of this Bill it would not be necessary for him to take out a practising solicitor's certificate.  If this amendment were not inserted and if he left the Civil Service and started practising on his own he would have to apply to the society for a practising certificate and they could refuse to give it to him at their discretion.  He has been practising in one or several senses all his life and the only difference is that he has not paid the necessary fee.  The amendment is to provide that the mere fact that while he was in the service of the State he has not had to fulfil the requirements of paying a fee would not mean that he should not be deemed to be a solicitor, and that on resuming practice outside the Civil Service he should have the necessary certificate to enable him to continue in practice.</P>

I do not know exactly what is intended there.  I think the practice at the moment is that the widow can get some other solicitor to act for her.  Is there a great lot of power being taken by the society?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would explain what is intended if he can.  Would this provision restrict the widow from taking on a solicitor herself?</P>

      <P>Section 59 which has been passed was for the purpose of ensuring that a solicitor's office would not be used as a front for an unqualified person.  Section 61, I think I am correct in saying, relaxes that and relaxes the existing law. The position, as I understand it, is that strictly speaking, on the death of a solicitor, the widow or no one else has the right to go in and ask another solicitor to carry on but, in fact, with the tacit approval of the Incorporated Law Society it has frequently been done in order to alleviate the hardship which is often caused by a sudden death.  What has been done in this section is simply to empower the council to legalise, if you like, the arrangement which has often been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is quite right that this section is a relaxation of the present law rather than an extension of it.  It permits the practice to be carried on possibly for the benefit of a growing son or, perhaps, pending profitable sale of the practice.  I am informed that the Incorporated Law Society have permitted the practice to go on and allowed the purchase money to be paid in instalments and generally they have enabled the retention of the family business for the benefit of the children growing up.  In any event in view of the compensation provision in the Bill at the present time it is desirable to prevent an unqualified person from having control over a solicitor's practice particularly having regard to the desirability of controlling clients' money after the death of the person. I can assure Deputy Boland if the section did what he said I certainly would not have stood over it.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to substitute a new section for the present Section 65 of the Bill.  The only reason the amendment is in the form of a new section is to make the thing easier of understanding and clearer in its intention. The only substantial change that is effected by the proposed new section is to extend to criminal proceedings the provisions of Section 65 as they are at present drafted which gives an assistant to the solicitor on record in a civil suit a similar right of audience to that of the solicitor on record.  The extension has been suggested by the profession through the medium of the Law Society, and I think we ought to accept it.

      <P>14.  Any claimant for a grant from the fund, may, if he so desires, be represented before the society by a qualified accountant.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to pinpoint what appears to me to be something that is missing from the Sixth Schedule, that is, reference to the mode of inquiry by the society into a claim made by an aggrieved client of a solicitor.

      <P>&ldquo;The society, for the purposes of inquiry into any matters which may affect the making or refusal of a grant from the fund, may take evidence on oath, and administration of such oath is hereby authorised.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious thing for an aggrieved <Col N="1324" /> person to do would be to go to another solicitor and to ask that solicitor to make representations to the society for compensation.

I think there can be no doubt that in many cases, not in all cases, the evidence of an accountant would be very desirable to establish the claim.  That will not be necessary in all cases; in fact it may not happen very frequently.  I think this is a question of evidence, and I would strongly object to a qualified accountant being put into this section as an advocate, and I think that is what the Deputy means by the amendment. Whether he intends to mean that or not I do not know, but as one who formerly practised as a barrister and who is dealing with a Bill for practising solicitors I would most strongly and strenuously object to having anything to do with a provision which would enable a qualified accountant to act as an advocate.

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 17 and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> 17.  Where the society are satisfied that dishonesty of a solicitor has occurred, they may apply to the High Court for, and the High Court may make, an order directing either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that no banking company shall, without leave of the High Court, make any payment out of a banking account in the name of the solicitor or his firm, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that a specified banking company shall not, without leave of the High Court, make any payment out of a banking account kept by such company in the name of the solicitor or his firm.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to substitute a new paragraph instead of the existing paragraph 17 of the Fifth Schedule. Under the existing paragraph the High Court was being given power to order that a specified banking company should not, without the leave or order of the court, make any payment out of a dishonest solicitor's banking account. As, however, there may be no information available as to the particular bank or banks at which a solicitor keeps accounts, it is desirable that the High Court should have power not only to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; payments by a specified bank but also payments by any banking company whatever.  This is what the new paragraph achieves.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  Before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The council may prepare and establish a register to be known as the Register of Visiting Postgraduate Medical Students.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the council is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that a person is or intends to be in the State for the purpose of obtaining a qualification (other than a qualifying diploma) in medicine, surgery or midwifery granted by any of the colleges or bodies mentioned in the Second Schedule to the principal Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that such person holds a degree or diploma which, in the opinion of the council, affords sufficient guarantee that he possesses the requisite knowledge and skill for the efficient practice of medicine, surgery and midwifery and passed the examination appropriate for obtaining such degree or diploma,</P>
      <P>the council may, upon such person's making the prescribed application and paying such fee as may be prescribed with the consent of the Minister, register such person in the Register of Visiting Postgraduate Medical Students.</P>
      <P>(3)  A person registered under this section shall cease to be so registered upon his obtaining the qualification in respect of which he was so registered or on such earlier date as may be determined by the council at its discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Sections 15 and 22 and sub-section (2) of Section 37 of the <Col N="1328" /> Principal Act shall apply in relation to the Register of Visiting Postgraduate Medical Students in like manner as these provisions apply in relation to the Register of Medical Practitioners.</P>
    <P>(5)  The name of a person registered in the Register of Visiting Postgraduate Medical Students shall be deemed to be included in the Register of Medical Practitioners for the purposes of any requirement of the college or body granting the qualification in respect of which he was registered in the Register of Visiting Postgraduate Medical Students and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to permit the registration in a separate register of doctors holding foreign degrees who wish to acquire qualifications in this country.  Some of these doctors would not be working in hospitals here and so would not come within the scope of Section 3 of the Bill.  This amendment would enable them to be registered for the purpose of obtaining a higher degree but it will not confer on them any right to work in their profession here as soon as they obtain the higher degree.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2, which stands in the name of Deputy Esmonde:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to that part of the section dealing with the accounts of the council and the audit thereof.  Following on the passing of the 1927 Act, there was an interim period when the medical council received State assistance.  Then there was some necessity for the Minister to inquire into the public moneys which were used.  However, that actual period lasted only for something like 12 months and for very many years no public moneys have been used at all.  It seems now that it is unnecessary to ask the Minister and to put the State to the expense of auditing the accounts of a council&mdash; which are purely a domestic matter&mdash; which the council is quite capable of doing itself.  We feel that the present desire of the Ministers of this Government to divest themselves of what I might describe as any powers of interference in purely domestic matters such as these should lead the Minister to accept this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>It is true, as Deputies have said, that, unlike the situation envisaged by the 1927 Act, the intention behind this Bill is to remove controls from the council and enable them to conduct their own affairs.  From my point of view I have no very definite views one way or the other in favour of Section 5 or in favour of the amendment to delete the section.  I am impressed by what Deputy Dockrell has said; if it will meet the Deputy's point of view, I will have the matter examined between this and the Report Stage in order to meet the objection to the inclusion of the section.</P>

      <P>For the reasons I have already mentioned, I think the Minister should divest himself of powers of interference and, in lieu of sub-section (3), he should put in a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; wherever these words occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, under the section the Minister retains power to approve of the amount of the registration fees fixed by the council.  That same provision applies in the case of dentists, nurses, pharmaceutical chemists, veterinary surgeons and a variety of professional bodies of that kind.  In each case the body is given a monopoly in the registration of members of the profession and power is given concurrently to charge fees.  Since the monopoly is given in registration and the power to charge fees the interests of the public, perhaps to a very limited extent but nevertheless to a certain extent, are affected and for that reason I feel the Minister should have some power to express a view as to the amount of fees to be charged.  That is done with the veterinary surgeons, the dentists, the nurses and also in the Bill we have just been discussing relating to the solicitors' profession.  In that Bill also power of approval of fees is retained by the Chief Justice.  I feel I cannot accept the amendment.  I think the very minimum the Minister should have is the right to approve of whatever fees the council may seek to charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene, somewhat unusually, at this stage in <Col N="1331" /> order to ask the Dáil to take another view of this matter?  All this stems from the 1927 Medical Practitioners Act.  When that Act was passed in 1927 public money was being devoted to or given over to the Medical Registration Council.  It was for that reason that this heavy apparatus of State control was put down upon that particular body.  Now we have got to the stage&mdash; actually that stage was reached a year after the passage of the 1927 Act in the case of the medical practitioners &mdash;when the provision of public money has ceased.  It is quite right to say that the Dentists Act is the same as this; that again stems from the same circumstances as those relating to the medical practitioners.  The Dentists Act was passed a year later and again there was provision for public money because for the first year during which the dentists were writing up their register staff had to be appointed ahead of their being entitled to get any revenue by way of fees.  The same is true of the Veterinary Surgeons Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has said is correct. To my mind the movement should be not to throw this back into the middle of 1927 but rather to bring the veterinary surgeons and the dentists into the new provision; that is to say, since they are not being provided with any public moneys they should be left entirely free.  The situation that has developed since the 1927 Act is, of course, absurd: it means that there is some group of civil servants&mdash;as far as the present measure is concerned it is the Department of Health&mdash;engaged for the last 27 years in looking after bodies which should have been completely and entirely independent.  They are not being provided with public funds and their duties are the duties germane to professional associations of responsible people.  They should be allowed to do these things on their own, clear of governmental and Civil Service control.  Two Ministers were in turn approached in connection with this particular point, and the Minister who was Minister for Health in January, 1948, wrote to the Medical Registration Council, to say that as far as he was concerned, he would give them an opportunity to put their house <Col N="1332" /> in order.  In the latter part of that year, a general letter of application came to me as Minister for Finance, and I replied that as long as the legislation was there, various applications would have to be made to me, but I regarded them as the merest formality, and I hinted that I intended to change the law as soon as I could.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Principal Act, into which the Minister seeks to put &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, has to deal with the making of regulations by the council.  Here are the things which the council is entitled to do.  They may by regulation do each of the following things, and I suggest these are the things which a body like the Medical Registration Council should be entitled to do.  The council, it can well be imagined, is a very responsible body, having, as it has, representatives from the National University, from Trinity, from the College of Surgeons and from the Apothecaries' Hall, two representatives from the Government and a certain number of people appointed by the profession. You could not consider a more sober body than one constituted in that way. They are entitled by regulations to prescribe all or any of the following things: (a) the procedure of the council at its meetings and otherwise; (b) the returns to be made to the council in respect of elections of direct representatives or of persons to fill casual vacancies by returning officers to such elections; (c) the maintenance and keeping generally of the register. Here the Minister creeps in because the Act says: &ldquo;and with the approval of the Minister, the form of the register.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put it to the Deputies here in 1954 to ask themselves what the Minister for Health or this Dáil would know about the form of such a register? Should that not be the function of the members of the Medical Registration Council?  I suggest it is a peculiarly bad type of interference, to have this House interfering with the form in which the register should be kept.  Yet that is one of the things for which it is proposed the approval of the Minister should be obtained.  The Act also gave the council power to prescribe by regulation, the form and mode of application for registration in the register <Col N="1333" /> and the evidence to be given on such application of the title of the applicant to be registered and, in paragraph (e), the form and mode of application for the entry of additional qualifications.</P>
    <P>Now we come to paragraph (f) and this is the place where the present Bill seeks to put in the Minister where he is not now.  Paragraph (g) deals with the preparation, printing, publication and sale generally of the Medical Register and again it says: &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister, the form of the Medical Register&rdquo;.  Again I ask what has the Minister got to do with the form in which the council will prepare, print and publish the register? You have, then, in the next paragraph, power given to the council to make regulations prescribing the conduct of and proceedings at inquiries into the conduct of registered persons.  I have left out (f).  Paragraph (f) says that the council may prescribe, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act, the fees to be paid for the registration of persons and the entry of additional qualifications in the register&rdquo;.  It is now proposed to put in the Minister there. Again I ask what has the Minister to do with this?  It is said that he has a function because there is public interest involved in regard to fees.  But remember these are not the fees that medical practitioners charge their patients. These are the fees to be paid to enable a person to get on the register.  The only revenue practically that this council has is derived from these fees.  It is the only revenue they got over the years, apart from some few investments from which they receive income by way of rent from certain premises.  Ninetenths of the revenue they derive is by way of registration fees.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what is the necessity for having ministerial control over these matters.  If there is any grievance in regard to fees for registration the members of the medical profession are the people who will see to that.  They have control of that body which they exercise through the elections held every five years.  I suggest there is no necessity for putting in the Minister here.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell on behalf <Col N="1334" /> of Deputy Esmonde that the Minister should be cleared out of Section 19 of the Act.  It has been said that the same provision applies in regard to other professions.  I agree that it was necessary to put it in the Act of 1927 but the circumstances were then entirely different and the time has gone when such powers should be exercised by the Minister.  It has been said that solicitors' fees have been prescribed as in the Bill which has just passed the Dáil.  They may be but one of the things about which we were very careful in that legislation was to remove the Minister from it.  It has been left to the Chief Justice and the Chief Justice ranks as part of the profession, though he may be said to belong to another side of it.  I doubt if there is a modern example of this type of legislation in regard to this type of body in which ministerial control is sought to be maintained.  It is a relic of the old days.  I was responsible for the previous Acts and I know the conditions under which these provisions were inserted in 1927 and 1928. The circumstances which then prevailed have entirely disappeared.  I think modern conditions dictate that bodies such as this should look after their own affairs.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary position and I am sure I cannot recollect anything like it before. The Attorney-General urged as far as I understand that ministerial control in reference to this medical body be deleted from this Bill on the grounds that no public moneys are involved. Speaking for myself, personally, I think there is a certain amount of sound principle in that.  I do not appreciate the Minister's attitude. The Minister is apparently not willing to accept this amendment and that is why the Attorney-General has intervened. That is the position as I see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who happens to occupy that position, but it is certainly not I.  In the situation that has arisen the House would want to see what are the reasons behind it.  It rather surprises me to find the particular Minister rejecting the <i>prima facie</i> case made by the Attorney-General because as in the case of the Local Government Bill, to my mind the less of this type of business that we saddle the central administration with the better.  In modern times the demand is for a certain balance in these things.  There must be co-ordination and there should not be a gobbling up of all powers by the central authority.  The Attorney-General has made a case in principle that would be acceptable to a large number of people.  The case in a nutshell is this. There are no public funds involved and this is a body that is capable of controlling its own affairs, and because there are no public funds involved, there is no legitimate reason why in this particular matter the central Executive or the Civil Service in particular should deal with it and, therefore, he thinks that the body in question should be free.  I must say, <i>prima facie</i>, there appears to be a great deal to be said for that, particularly in modern circumstances.  Perhaps I am expressing a personal view in that.  It definitely is my own personal view in the matter and a very strong personal view but, as I have said already, there must be some very strong reasons in this particular <Col N="1336" /> instance as to why the Minister will not see fit to accept the amendment.  It seems to me all the more extraordinary&mdash;and I think I am entitled to comment on it objectively&mdash;to find the Minister and the Attorney-General, be he in his capacity as a Deputy or otherwise, having this out here, so to speak.  If the matter could not be resolved to mutual satisfaction within the team, it seems an extraordinary situation.  Therefore, I think, there is very good reason for me to ask that the Minister will make us a very full statement on this matter as to why he wants to keep it.</P>
      <P>I would like to supplement what the Attorney-General said.  In the case of the solicitors, there is a power in the Chief Justice.  Quite right.  But we must remember that solicitors are officers of the court&mdash;are they not&mdash;and the Chief Justice would be, very naturally, apart from anything else, the person. So that you cannot argue that case and the solicitor's case is no argument at all.  In fact, every solicitor, as an officer of the court, is under the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice.  In the case of the dentists the reason is given already and the very simple answer is the one already given, namely, if the thing is an anachronism and past its proper time, then let us deal with that case too.</P>
      <P>I do not think I should say very much because, quite frankly, I am somewhat surprised and a little bit in the dark in that.  I can only believe there must be some very strong reasons on the part of this particular Minister in failing to accept what is proposed here.</P>

I think my own view would be that I support both the Minister's amendment and the amendment of Deputy Dockrell in so far as the second amendment by the <Col N="1337" /> Deputy seeks to take out from the other paragraphs &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.  But, as the Minister has mentioned, paragraph (f) in a way, has a certain element of public interest.

I do not see why those already in a particular profession should now be given a right to put a high step in front of anyone who is being qualified in that profession. There is that possible danger.  As the Attorney-General mentioned, the amount of interference which has taken place under Section 19 of the principal Act was the minimum and I would certainly urge the Minister to stand fast with regard to this matter.</P>

On the other hand I also certainly agree that the other paragraphs which contain some such provision should be amended by getting rid of that because there does not seem to be any point why the Minister should have to approve of the form of a register.

      <P>Deputy McGilligan informed me of his views before I came in here.  I said I could not agree with him.  I said that this is the place to state them and Deputy McGilligan has done that.  But, getting down to what is exactly the position, Deputy de Valera, I think following the line of Deputy McGilligan, appears to regard this Bill as a Bill designed to impose controls on the Medical Registration Council whereas in fact it is a Bill designed to remove controls from the Medical Registration Council. At the moment, under Deputy McGilligan's legislation, the Medical Registration Council is fettered down with ministerial controls from the <Col N="1339" /> Department of Finance.  Those controls were embodied in the 1927 Act, repeated in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1951.</P>
      <P>I have proposed to the House a Bill to remove all such ministerial controls from the registration council and to leave them as they are, a vocational body representative of the medical profession, with duties to register and to prescribe registration standards for medical schools.  In doing that and in carrying out their functions they should be divorced completely from any Civil Service control.  That is done in this Bill.  The only thing I have said is: &ldquo;Remember that under the law of this country no medical man, no person knowledgeable in medicine or medical matters may practise unless he is registered.&rdquo;  That is unlike Deputy McGilligan's profession and Deputy de Valera's.  It is permissible to practise at the Bar without being a member of the Law Library.  The call to the Bar, without any registration fees, entitles both Deputy McGilligan and Deputy de Valera to practise. Passing one's final medical examination and getting a degree from the university does not entitle a graduate to practise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to practise, he must get on the Irish register, and to get on the register he must pay an appropriate fee.  The Minister does not define or state the fee but, as I stated a few minutes ago, in so far as the public interest is affected, and it may be only to a slight degree, it does seem reasonable that the Minister should be asked&mdash;should be consulted&mdash;with regard to what fees are to be chargeable. I feel that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy de Valera, who have joined together in this matter, are exaggerating about what is in fact a usual provision in relation to every profession which gets a monopoly by the conferring of registration.  I cannot think of any other profession where this does not apply.  The other professions I have mentioned&mdash;the dental profession, the veterinary profession, the pharmaceutical chemists&mdash;these are the few that occur to my mind&mdash; all these cases the responsible <Col N="1340" /> Minister&mdash;the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;are empowered to approve of the fees being charged for registration.  I cannot see what is wrong with it.  That is the only element of ministerial control being retained; everything else has been removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And we have been tending so much in the opposite direction!  We have had a long battle on the Local Government Bill, for instance, against the unnecessary intervention of the executive in either individual or collective affairs, and it is for that reason&mdash;it is on that principle&mdash;that I want to throw in my lot with other people who desire to guard against unnecessary control. I agree the Minister for Health has tended otherwise but I should like to make another comment.  We have rather got into the habit of thinking that because something might happen we have to do it.  I have heard the case made on the amendment but we seem to forget that we have the power in this House and that the Dáil has the power to deal with anything when it arises as quickly as a controlling Minister.  That is something to bear in mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accused us of vague fears&mdash;that the psychology behind this is vague fears.  Let us rule that out.  There is another point which is perhaps a point of instinctive fairness.  Why take certain bodies and prescribe for them, and why leave other bodies severely alone?  Why should sauce for the goose not also be sauce for the gander?  There are certain organisations where it would be in the public interest perhaps to take precautions.  Mark the word &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;; it is a very definite qualification, but we are dealing here with the principle of things.  Why go for certain professional bodies and certain organisations in these matters and why leave others aside?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why keep this sort of provision in connection with medical, pharmaceutical and solicitors' professions in some cases, and strenuously, carefully and assiduously avoid it in connection with other bodies?  A lot of our past legislation has had that mark&mdash;that we have been rather prone to legislating for certain interests and not for others.  But I am afraid I am going very wide afield in all this.  The way I should like to put this to the Minister is that there is more or less some very good reason for keeping the ministerial finger in the pie here.  In modern days of modern tendencies this is being done with greater frequency.  If there is no very good reason for this it is all the more reason for keeping the finger out of the pie where it is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is the fairest way of putting it.  This particular amendment is only a very trivial matter but what is going to happen is, in fact, that the medical people will arrange their own affairs and the Minister will give an automatic approval, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out.  But why should the Minister have to go through the motions?  Why should he retain the legal right of intervention when it is not necessary?  I would put the matter &mdash;I am, of course, talking for myself only&mdash;on a question of principle and would be inclined to say to the Minister: &ldquo;This power does not really matter to you&rdquo;.  I agree that the Minister has made a very good move.  We have been pressing the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and, incidentally, the Minister for Health is involved in it through the phrase &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo;&mdash;in another Bill where there are powers of control being vested in the Minister for Health as well as others and in which the case is being made that these powers are necessary.  The situation has become one in which the Executive is taking more and more powers into itself and giving so little back.  If this is an opportunity for giving back even token <Col N="1342" /> powers the Minister would be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The public safeguard is required in 1954 in respect of something which has carried on at least in this matter without a shadow of control, when there has not been a whimper from anybody about the public interest being affected, when there has not been a whimper of complaint from the profession to the council itself with regard to the way they operated in respect of the fees to be discharged.  It has been stated that there are other professions hampered in this way.  We should relieve these people from that same sort of control if that control be there. I am not sure if it is there in regard to dentists or the veterinary people in respect of fees of registration.  I would be surprised if it is because I have carried through most of these 1927 and 1928 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If controls on minor matters like this in regard to the fees for registration are put in the hands of a member of the Government, you bring in some group of civil servants or some form of supervision.  The Vocational Organisation Commission, when it reported with regard to the professional bodies and more particularly with <Col N="1344" /> regard to the doctors and dentists, as well as the two branches of the legal profession, held them up for public approval as models of the real type of vocational organisation.  It was said that they had shortcomings and suggestions were made.  One of the things which the Solicitors Bill has done is to provide for some of these deficiencies which the commission said vocational bodies should correct, better education for their members and also text-books.  That has been attended to in the piece of legislation we have just passed.  If there is a representative from Trinity, from the National University, from Surgeons, from the Apothecaries' Hall, and two representatives of the Government side on that board to report back to the Government anything that is going on, there is that amount of supervision. There are also representatives of the doctors practising in the country.  Is that not a body we should at least trust that they will behave properly in regard to this minor matter of charging a fee for people going on the register?  If we allow ourselves to be obsessed with fears, we do not know what might happen; we will be providing ministerial, governmental and Civil Service control of all sorts of bodies that are now free.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are people who would like to exert control over barristers.  We have a group of people looking after our affairs and they are a very good group.  Nobody has ever seen their accounts except members of the profession, and only a very select circle of members of the profession.  But the accounts are produced and audited as a matter of proper business and everything goes smoothly.  Originally they had to raise the charges for students as far as the law is concerned.  They raised them substantially and they had a very good case.  There was nobody to say: &ldquo;This is going too far.  You should not have raised them by&rdquo;&mdash; whatever the percentage was.  These bodies are operating for years along that line.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that for the receipt of about £300 or £400 a Government exercises enormous controls.  I often thought it would be a good thing on <Col N="1345" /> which to have a question put and on which to have statistical information. Over the years the revenue of the Medical Council has been on an average between £500 and £600.  It has risen to £1,200 or £1,300 this year on account of professional registration and so on. I would not be surprised to learn that there had been as much money lifted from the public in the payment of Civil Service salaries looking after the Medical Registration Council as the entire revenue of the council in any year. I think in the year 1954 they ought to take a proper attitude towards this good body.  This is a last remnant of control.  They have been controlling their affairs very effectively for years, and two Ministers from different Parties approved of them.  The Miniter for Health in 1948 said he would let them put their own house in order, and when they came to me in August, 1948, I said: &ldquo;As long as the laws are there you have to make submissions to me.  I will see that they are the merest formality.&rdquo;  I wrote a letter in 1948 and the Minister for Health wrote also in 1948&mdash;there are also letters in this connection in 1951&mdash;to the effect: &ldquo;We will free you one of these days. It is only a matter of awaiting an opportunity for legislating.&rdquo;  The opportunity is here now and let us take the chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one final point I want to add.  There is a danger that Deputies could exaggerate this into something that it is not. Remember, you are dealing with a profession. Medical practitioners in the medical profession under the laws of this land are the only persons entitled to practise medicine.  It is an offence for anyone who is not a registered medical practitioner to practise medicine. That is quite right and quite proper, and the State interference through the years has been to protect the medical profession and medical practitioners from quackery and things of that kind.  That is there in our law. The point of view that has been ventilated this evening by Deputy de Valera and Deputy McGilligan is to close one's eyes completely to the whole facade of the law as it applies to the practice of medicine.  You cannot <Col N="1346" /> do that.  Right through the years, with the possible exception of the Act of 1927, there has been a benevolent disposition by the State towards the protection of medical practitioners. Here, now, all the remnants of any fetters or controls of any kind are being removed from the Medical Registration Council, which represents the medical practitioners.  The only thing insisted upon is that since this body has a complete monopoly and complete control in itself and in its membership of the education and the registration of persons entitled to practise, the State should be consulted with regard to the registration fees they impose. That is not because the State has any interest in what they do with their money.  That particular control is removed.  It is not because the Minister has any interest in the amount of fees they collect.  An inquiry as to that has been removed by the Bill.  The only reason for that is to ensure that the public interest be not completely forgotten about by the desirable monopoly that is created in the practice of medicine, and I think it is reasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other bodies may I say that all other professions that have a similar monopoly have registration fees which in each case must be approved of by the Minister? I am sure Deputy McGilligan will be interested to learn, with regard to veterinary surgeons, that whoever sponsored the legislation concerning the registration of veterinary surgeons was not quite satisfied that the Minister for Agriculture alone should approve of the fees&mdash;and the fees must be approved of by the Government itself.</P>

Certainly, I do not think it <Col N="1347" /> would be right to entertain any situation where there is absolutely no say by those responsible for the people generally in regard to the amount of the fees likely to be charged.  I think Deputy McGilligan raised certain points with regard to Section 19 which were supported by Deputy Sheldon and which appeared to me to have some merit.  I am not at the moment briefed to deal with the effects of this, but I think Deputy McGilligan referred to sub-section (c) of Section 19 of the principal Act and sub-section (g).  Both these sub-sections refer to the form of the register and the keeping generally of the register in its form, its preparation, printing and sale.  It appears to me that that should be a matter entirely for the council and not one in which the Minister is directly concerned.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very small point which I should like to raise <Col N="1348" /> on this: it is small in one sense and of some substance in another.  It is small in relation to some of the principles we have been trying to deal with but important from the point of view of the personnel affected.  It is that, under this section, there will be provision for panels to select people for appointment to offices.  That is the purport of the section.  It has been pointed out to me that a situation like this may arise&mdash;and I do not know what the practice has been heretofore. Supposing an office is vacant for some remote county and a number of people go up.  The man who is selected may find that a more attractive berth becomes available in the meantime and that he would like to apply for that post.  At the moment, as I understand it, there is nothing to stop him.  I think that on an earlier section the Minister dealt with abuses that could arise on the taking-up of appointments.  However, as I understand the situation, a man may be selected for appointment A and, if another appointment comes up within a reasonable period, he may reject that and go for the other one and there is no bar against it.  There is the inherent danger here that if a man is selected from a panel and does not take the appointment given to him, he may go down to the bottom of the panel Would the Minister consider amending this section on the Report Stage in order to meet the point that a man on a panel would have the option, if it suited him, of refusing the appointment within a reasonable time &mdash;I am with the Minister in the other matter&mdash;and still be retained on the panel?  I do not know if there are any other implications, but people who have some direct interest in the matter have suggested that that point should be inquired into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this section, the explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister defines the word &ldquo;road&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;any public road and to include any bridge, pipe, arch, gully, footway, pavement, fence, railing or wall&rdquo; which was &ldquo;erected by or was liable to be maintained by the county council or grand jury, forming part thereof.&rdquo;  I wonder is there full clarity in regard to fences and roads?  What are the liabilities of owners of land upon which these fences are erected?  From time to time such owners are served with a notice to breast these hedges and keep fences under repair.  Very often they are brought to court and fined.</P>
      <P>Further on, the Minister takes power to make a declaration as to what is a main road and to take over certain roads.  This power is already in existence. I would like the Minister to let us know if the law is sufficiently specific to include a provision, where he declares a main road, that the inhabitants along that declared road shall be liable for the breasting and fencing of hedges along that road. This is a very important point and I think at one time there was a case in the south of England where a particular farmer on a particular road beat the Ministry on the other side in relation to liability.  If under this and other sections we were to take over certain roads and if we had not the power to compel the people living on those roads to do their duty in order to ensure that public money would be expended to the best advantage, then the Minister should in this particular Bill clarify the position.</P>
      <P>I suggest he should examine it and, if necessary, put in certain amendments on the Report Stage to make the position quite clear.</P>

We have amended the law in this Bill to <Col N="1350" /> facilitate prosecutions for breaches of that particular section in the particular statute.  Unfortunately, as the law stands at the moment, only the county surveyor can prosecute for breaches of this provision whereby land owners are compelled to trim hedges.  We have amended that in order to enable the prosecution to be brought in the name of the local authority instead of that of the county surveyor.  That will facilitate matters because we all know quite well that in some counties we have not got a county surveyor and we cannot institute proceedings of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But that law would also apply where the Minister declares a public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The onus is on the land owner.  That is the law.  In specific cases where the local authority takes over lands and makes new fences, in certain cases the local authority itself will be responsible for such fences erected in specific circumstances. The Deputy has a number of such instances in his own county where corners have been cut off and roads straightened out; the local authority will be responsible in such cases.  I think it is the Highways Act of 1870 which enables prosecutions to be brought by the county surveyor and the main reason for this particular section is to clarify the position.  Under the Local Government Act, 1925, a public road is defined: &ldquo;the word &lsquo;road&rsquo; means any public road and includes any bridge, pipe, arch, gully, footway, pavement, fence, railing or wall (where such fence, railing or wall was erected by or was liable to be maintained by the county council or grand jury) forming part thereof.&rdquo; That is a very good definition under the 1925 Act, but under the Barbed Wire Act, for instance, of 1893, the word &ldquo;highway&rdquo; is used.  In the Local Government (Ireland) Act of 1898 &ldquo;public highway&rdquo; is used.  In the Public Health Act of 1898 it is a &ldquo;highway repairable by the inhabitants&rdquo; on it.  Now we are trying to get a common denominator for all these, and that is the only reason why this section is included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Allen in that.  There are two comments I would like to make.  The first is that, &ldquo;subject to such conditions as they may think fit&rdquo; is an unlimited power.  I suppose the Minister feels it is necessary to give power in a rather unlimited way.  For once the structure of the section appeals to me rather more than that of others.  Here we have power given to the local authority, with power of appeal so to speak to the Minister; if the Minister can keep that particular structure in all its provisions, then I would be fairly happy. Could the case made by Deputy Allen be met in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I refer the Deputy to Section 29 of the Local Government Act of 1925 which was the section which dealt with the <Col N="1353" /> closing of roads prior to this.  The section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the application of the council, charged with the maintenance of the new road, the Minister may by Order made after giving such public notice as may be prescribed in that behalf by regulations made under this Act and after holding such (if any) local inquiry as he shall think necessary, authorise such council to close such road or any particular portion thereof to public traffic for such period and subject to such conditions as the Minister shall think proper and shall specify in the Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is done after local inquiries are made and it is merely on whatever recommendation comes up from the local authority that the Minister makes the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would this meet the Minister or meet Deputy Allen?  I like the structure of the section, I must say, and the principle involved in it, that the power should be with the local authority.  On the other hand, Deputy Allen has expressed a different point of view.  You have in sub-section (4) this provision:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order annul or vary any decision or order made by a local authority under this section and the local authority shall give such public notice of the Order made by the Minister as may be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can the Minister meet Deputy Allen, first of all, by prescribing this as a point of practice&mdash;first, sufficient notoriety of the fact and, then, put in a provision enabling the individual in a minimum time, to appeal direct to the Minister if he is aggrieved?</P>

      <P>As I have said, I rather like the structure the Minister has adopted in this section but if there was some method by which an aggrieved individual could get redress quickly, it would be better.  If the appeal is made to the person who made the order, there is a very natural human tendency to say that the other person is unreasonable, but if there is an appeal to a third person who has authority to make the particular person concerned act reasonably, then there is a safeguard.  If there were some provision by which an individual could appeal simply and quickly to the Minister, it would meet the point.  Let us take a case that may arise.  First of all, there may be such a thing as a road race, and a crank writes in and objects to blue motor cars coursing around the road.  Some person will write to him a mollifying letter to the effect that &ldquo;he regrets&rdquo; etc.  On the other hand, if a farmer finds that he has no exit from or entrance to his house or that he is going to be unnecessarily precluded from the use of his farm, if the Minister would write a letter to the farmer saying that the matter was under consideration, the fact that the letter would be written from the Custom House to the local authority concerned or the executive thereof&mdash;the local authority would be the county manager in this case&mdash;would probably mean that the matter would be attended to pretty quickly.  I am merely suggesting this as a gesture to meet Deputy Allen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely sub-section (3) by implication provides for special cases.

Surely the local authority closing a road can give due authority to a farmer to use the road.</P>

      <P>I must say that I cannot see there is much need for any modification of this proposal.  I believe this is a very useful amendment of the law and, if it is a useful amendment of the law, there is hardly any purpose in trying to provide safeguards that would make the operation of this proposal here as unworkable as the existing <Col N="1355" /> law in practice was.  I do not think I have ever seen myself a case where in circumstances such as these, the local authority treated people unfairly. We know that such instances could arise but the likelihood of their arising, in face of the public outcry and criticism that would result, is very remote indeed.  If it does arise there is an appeal and I think that is sufficient.  When you are looking for extended powers for a local body as a result of the experience of whatever practice has been in existence, there is scarcely any point in seeking such extended powers and at the same time trying to create, by an amendment, a situation that would leave you more or less where you were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that this section was put into the Bill not exactly to facilitate the local authority in the closing of roads unless races were going to be held.  There are two sub-sections, sub-sections (2) and (3), which deal with races.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the whole section.  I agree in giving this power to the local authority instead of having it in the hands of the Minister because that leaves it in the hands of the local engineer to remedy any difficulties that may arise.  I, however, had experience and many of my neighbours had the same experience, a great number of years ago, where a concrete road had been constructed.  It was handed over to a contractor who did not live in this country.  He was given full right of the law to preserve his road and he unduly penalised all the residents along that particular road by keeping it closed for seven or eight weeks.  The residents had to travel miles and miles through fields, to bring their farm produce through fields and to level ditches between themselves and their neighbours.  I do not want a recurrence of such a situation.  The law is the same now as it was except that it <Col N="1356" /> is now handed over to the local authority instead of the Minister.  All I ask is that the Minister would consider bringing in an amendment on Report Stage providing for the reasonable rights of residents on a particular highway.  That is all I want.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can add very much to what Deputy Smith has said.  He has covered everything that could be said for the section.  I appreciate Deputy Allen's point, but a very dangerous practice has crept in recently in some local authorities whereby, instead of applying for a closing Order they stick up a diversion notice.  I think Deputy Sheldon is not unaware of one of them on the Slane Road.  When I did mention the matter to the county engineer the reply I got was: &ldquo;We want to get a job done.  By the time we would get a closing Order the time for doing the repairs would be passed and we adopted this method.&rdquo;</P>

I am in full agreement with the county engineer, because it would have taken too long to get a closing Order.  We are going to simplify the law.  Each and any individual will have the right to make representations to the Minister to annul the Order or amend the Order or vary it, as the case may be, in accordance with sub-section (4).  I think the protection is given there to individuals.  Individuals may make representations, first of all, to the local authority.  If the local authority, despite these representations, proceed to make an order, the individual has the right of appeal to the Minister.  That right is in sub-section (4) and I do not think we should amend the section.</P>

This section is a good section but I am asking will this section now enable a local authority to prevent people erecting signs which are obstructions on, say, a main road, or which are confusing to people on a main road.  I do not know how other local authorities are affected but in the vicinity of Dublin on very important main roads advertising signs have been put up, fluorescently lit, and so forth, which have been the cause of accidents and which, we maintain, are liable to cause accidents, but for the removal of which we have no power under the existing law.

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Briscoe has said, there is this difficulty that because it is the Guards who take the case, they have no right of appeal&mdash;they do not appeal anyway, and I understand they have not the right to appeal.  This all arises because of the confusion under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  I am sorry in a way to find that the peculiar position under that Act is being continued here.  The difficulty about road signs is that it is the Minister for Local Government who decides what will be on them, and it is the Commissioner or the Minister for Justice&mdash;I think it is the Commissioner&mdash;who will decide where they will go.  I think one of the reasons why this country is very badly provided with signs is this dual authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that&mdash;which is more or less a suggestion for the amendment of other legislation&mdash;I hope the Minister will take powers now or, at least, I hope he has them in this section, to prevent the sort of nonsense that at present goes on with regard to some road signs.  I am not talking about permanent ones but temporary ones.  Frequently, driving through the City of Dublin, one is confronted with a large sign which says &ldquo;No Thoroughfare&rdquo; or &ldquo;No Road.&rdquo;  In fact those signs are not true.  They just get a red sign and <Col N="1360" /> stick it up whether the type of work described on the sign is going on or not.  They also stick up signs saying &ldquo;No Thoroughfare&rdquo; on a roadway where in fact a thoroughfare exists, for instance where tramlines are being taken up in the centre, and where lines of traffic are moving on either side. Such things as these tend to bring our road signs into contempt and the Minister should see to it that the various local authorities have a prescribed type of sign for the type of work they are doing.  Apart from the awful grammar you will see in &ldquo;Drive Slow&rdquo; and so on, I think the Minister should ensure that there is some sense in the signs that are put up.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (14) deals with nearly all the points in which I am interested, but I see one point in it which I should like to raise.  I wonder if the Minister would add in that section for the Report Stage a few words such as &ldquo;or which in the opinion of the local authority or the Garda, may be a cause of danger&rdquo;?  That is the only thing I think is not covered.</P>

      <P>The Gardaí are in the matter already.  It is on the advice of the Gardaí that the Minister will make the regulations.  The Gardaí will actually enforce them.  This provision is in accordance with the 1949 convention on road traffic.  The Minister for Local Government will be the responsible Minister but the Gardaí will be responsible for enforcing the regulations&mdash;they will be the enforcing authority.</P>

We have talked in other debates about the powers of <Col N="1361" /> central government and in all fairness to the Ministers concerned these powers are necessary sometimes to prevent a different type of tyranny from the local representatives in certain cases.

      <P>I am afraid Deputy de Valera does not realise fully the extent of the responsibilities which fall on the local authorities for the insurance of the safety of people on the streets and on the roads.  They have to take upon themselves the responsibility for the erection of traffic lights and for ensuring that street crossings are rendered safe for the public in conjunction with the Gardaí.  It is to the local authorities that the complaints come. I wonder if the Minister would agree that the last line of sub-section (14) would read &ldquo;less visible or dangerous to road users&rdquo; instead of its present form which says only: &ldquo;less visible.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Briscoe that there should be the slight changes he says in that particular section.  The point is that while the Guards may enforce the regulations there should also be some responsibility placed on the local authorities. Up to the present moment local authorities did not have any powers of enforcement.  I would ask the Minister to consider that particular problem.  Take the simple things of ordinary level crossings and road islands, etc.  In all these instances the local authority is the body which initiates these safety measures.</P>

It is quite usual to find a sign with &ldquo;crossroads&rdquo; and underneath it &ldquo;dangerous bend&rdquo;, whereas five miles down the road you will find the order is reversed and the sign for the crossroads comes after the sign for the dangerous bend.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested in one particular point.  This section, I understand, gives local authorities the power to employ traffic wardens to deal with cases of children crossing public thoroughfares.  The point that strikes me immediately is that the question of control of traffic is in the hands of the Gardaí, and if it is proposed to supplement the Gardaí by traffic wardens in any local authority I think provision should be made for the same authority that pays the Gardaí to pay the traffic wardens and the burden should not be placed on the backs of the local authorities.  We have a very serious problem here in this city.  There are dangers outside schools and outside the various churches and we have, I think, been faced over quite a number of years with a very serious shortage of personnel to control traffic.  To control traffic for the safety of our citizens and particularly for the children of our citizens might well entail the employment of a considerable number of traffic wardens.  The idea is an excellent one if provision is made that where such are employed the local authority shall be recouped for the expenditure involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to look at this from the point of view of our own conditions here.  The first thing we have to ask is, what is the purpose of bringing wardens in at all. To my mind, unless there was some other reason, apart from actual control of crossings, the obvious and simple thing to do is to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána correspondingly and leave the one unit there.  Note my qualification.  If it was merely a question of policing the crossings the only valid argument to be advanced against that is that it would hardly be economic to have the number of Guards we want.  To my mind the best thing to do would be to increase the police force to meet this problem. It is going to be simpler and it is going to avoid bringing in a new complication in the form of a new animal called a warden.  It is going to ensure that traffic control at such crossings will have the same force and effect as the accepted traffic control at another point.  There is going to be opportunities for promotion in the Gardaí corresponding to the increase in the points of duty.  There are a whole lot of arguments to run that way.  Why then do we want to have wardens here?  I conceive the idea to be that it is envisaged that at these crossings placed directly at schools teachers or some members of the staff of schools can do that duty.  However, generally speaking, it would take a great deal to compensate for the rejection of the argument that the Gardaí should do this.  If this policing is going to be a serious matter and is going to be a real control with the full force of the law behind it, then when it comes to matters of prosecution, and so on and so forth, the arguments for having it in the hands of the Gardaí are very, very strong.  If, however, it is going to be approached on a short-term basis of cost, I suppose the costing would work out in favour of the wardens. Secondly, I think it can be argued and I think this is what is accepted in the <Col N="1367" /> section, teachers or some people like that might be made available.  Frankly, if it means recruiting another type of warden, another type of special policeman for it, I cannot see the merit of going outside the Gardaí at all.  I think it would be far better to have the Gardaí do the job and let them increase their size&mdash;that is, if it involves recruiting special whole-time wardens.  If, however, it can be got, say, from the personnel of schools, they have to be vested with authority.</P>
      <P>I think the whole question of the principle involved in sub-section (1) requires a certain amount of clarification on that point because the local authority may, with the consent of the Commissioner of the Gardaí, make arrangements.  When you have that type of thing&mdash;where people may make arrangements&mdash;it is easy enough to get into the position that something will not be anybody's business.  That is a danger to be guarded against, too. This particular warden's duty has to be somebody's business and the somebody must have the full weight of the authority of a policeman behind him in doing it.  The somebody must be in a position to prosecute an offender in court with the same force and the same effect as a member of the Garda Síochána.  That somebody must have the same force and effect and weight to control the crossings as a member of the Gardaí in uniform would have. I am not too clear that all these requirements would follow from the section as it is worded.  I am not too clear as to what is intended.  If it is merely a special force of wardens of the local authority, I cannot see why the local police cannot do it.  If it is the using of the staff of the schools, perhaps an arrangement could be come to.  In any event, and I come to the point of Deputy Larkin in a circuitous way, it is essentially a policing duty.  It is essentially the protection of lawful users of the highway.  I think the responsibility should be placed on the Gardaí authorities in this matter, and the consequential financial burden would go in the same quarter.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that.  I can see difficulties arising out of that suggestion, particularly in cases where religious communities are running schools.  Is it suggested that members of these religious orders should put somebody out to do wardens' duty?  That would be a ridiculous situation.  Then it comes back to the question of whether wardens should be hired specially for the job or whether the police should do it.  I would plump for the police in every case, even if it meant an increase in the strength of the police force.  There is no other way of enforcing the law except through the police&mdash;and to give authority to people acting in the capacity of part-time policemen is, I submit, dangerous.  We know that it happens in another part of this country but I do not think we should follow their lead.</P>

      <P>I welcomed this section when I saw it and I think every member of the local authority to which I belong welcomed it.  For years, we have been making representations to the Department of Justice to help us <Col N="1369" /> in the serious problem of providing some protection for school children using the roads when going to and coming from school.  We have had a number of discussions.  In fact, one of the members of our local authority himself unfortunately suffered a loss in that one of his children was fatally injured in an accident in this particular type of situation.  We recognised that, in order effectively to carry out this protection of children against traffic, you could not possibly ask the Government to increase the strength of the Gardaí to the number that would be required.</P>

      <P>We also felt, as Deputy Tully has just mentioned, that you could not expect the school authorities to take on this responsibility.  Therefore, we suggested and agreed&mdash;and we agree with this section&mdash;that a special type of officer should be created, a traffic warden who could be recruited from, say, Gardaí pensioners, Army pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we have in Dublin City a large population of school-going children.  We have a great number of schools.  Even if we did appoint pensioners of the variety we have referred to, it would impose a very considerable added burden of cost on the local authority.  I join with Deputy Larkin in asking the Minister, in putting this matter through now&mdash; which is long overdue&mdash;whether there will be some chance that the local authority will get, if not the full cost returned, at least some substantial contribution towards it.  In the interests of the safety of our young people, we are bound to deal with this. There is another side to the matter which concerns, not school children but <Col N="1370" /> old people.  At different times throughout the year certain big events take place which may mean a large influx of people into our city.  During these big events, as a result of the large influx of people, traffic is increased in various ways and old people find themselves in great difficulty when trying to cross the streets.  In such cases, the Gardaí could call on the services of these traffic wardens for this particular duty whenever it is expected to arise.  I have no objection to the section.</P>
    <P>I have read it carefully and tried to interpret it as best I could.  It concerns a problem which has faced us for a considerable time and which we have discussed as members of the council&mdash; we have a special traffic committee of the corporation&mdash;with the Gardaí.  We think this is a solution to the problem. The only thing which arises from it is what is the extent of the cost going to be.</P>
    <P>We feel that the State should control these wardens.  They should be directly under the control of the Garda authorities and they should not in any way be directed by the local authority which is not in a position to deal with these matters.  In the first place, people would be selected who would be regarded as being an arm, if you life, of the Gardaí.  They would be responsible and reliable people who would be able to act with the authority of the law behind them, irrespective of whatever band they wore, or signal or sign they carried, on their arms.  We agree with all that. The only thing we say is that it would be most unfair to put the full burden of cost on the back of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with what Deputy Briscoe has said. I think some system of warden or protection for school children, particularly in urban areas, is very, very essential.  Indeed, in Dublin it is vitally essential.  On the whole I think it would be more satisfactory if that system were under the direct control of the Garda authorities.  In certain parts of Dublin I notice the Gardaí at present doing that work and it occurs to me that the hours during which that protection is <Col N="1371" /> required for children would tie in fairly easily with normal police duty because, for one thing, it does not occur at the peak hours of traffic.</P>
      <P>I may be completely out of order in mentioning this matter, though it is related somewhat to this whole question: I refer to the provision of speed limits in the built-up areas.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider that and I would urge him to meet the views put forward by Deputy Briscoe by ensuring as far as he can the Commissioner will, in fact, control any system of traffic warden that may be instituted.  Trained police officers are much better qualified to do that kind of work rather than retired employees of local authorities.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, I quite realise that this has a particular connection with such a largely urbanised area as Dublin.  I agree with what Deputy Larkin has said but, and I think this was brought out very clearly by Deputy Briscoe, it may lead to complications.  Remember, we shall have to consider other centres as well as Dublin because this is a problem confronting many other areas.  I have in mind seaside resorts where such control is vitally important at the present time.  I do not want to go into the matter too deeply here, but it might easily happen that, if we start with wardens for school children, that practice may spread a little further later on.  It is specifically stipulated &ldquo;the local authority in consultation with the Commissioner&rdquo;: the local authority may in time find it necessary to consult with the Commissioner about some system of control in connection with traffic on Sunday mornings.  Along the seaboard there is very heavy traffic, and in recent years it is noticeable that these areas have become very dangerous because no control is available. It might happen that this policy would in future be extended and the consultation between the local authorities and the Commissioner might crop up very frequently.  Where do we go from there?  We are still in the position that we do not know who will pay for these wardens or how they will be appointed. <Col N="1372" /> Will the local authorities appoint them under the present system of selection boards?  I think this is a matter about which we shall have to be very careful. I am not in favour of members of local authorities suggesting the appointment of wardens in different parts of different counties, because we may have our eye on certain individuals to whom we may consider it very handy to give a couple of bob by getting them appointed as wardens.  It is all right so long as the matter is confined to Dublin as a problem confronting school children.  If it goes outside Dublin, I can tell the House we will have our eye on the wardens.</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of unanimity in the House and at the same time a certain amount of confusion.  I agree in principle with what Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Desmond have said but the sub-section says in effect that the local authority may appoint and make arrangements for patrolling by persons employed or nominated by them.  In effect, it is the local authority who will employ, nominate and direct because it is that body which will make arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am not against the section.  I do not think any Deputy is.  We want to find out how it will work.  Let us pass whatever we are passing with our eyes open.  Here is the difficulty, and I think these are Deputy Desmond's fears: if a local authority is going to nominate, make the arrangements and in fact do everything subject only to getting the consent of the Commissioner, I cannot see the Commissioner objecting very much.  I think that consent would be largely a matter of form.  Therefore, the whole burden will be on the local <Col N="1373" /> authority.  Let us take that as the intention of the section.  What the section is doing indirectly is putting the Commissioner and the Gardaí in a position which is really not their job. Remember, what the section does is that, as soon as it is made law, and Deputy Desmond's authority or the Dublin Corporation approaches the Commissioner, certain arrangements will be made.  I am, of course, talking now purely on a hypothetical basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; I am talking as it were of a hypothetical Commissioner.  This is no aspersion on the Gardaí.  Up to this it has been the duty of the police to protect children on the roads, and they do all they possibly can in that respect. During the peak hours Gardaí are on duty at every crossing, shepherding the children over the roads.  As soon as this becomes law and the corporation make an overture to the Commissioner for more facilities the police will turn round and say: &ldquo;You have the powers; you find the wardens; you make the arrangements.&rdquo;  That is what this provision really means and I am questioning whether this is the best way of doing things.  There is absolute need for control on the roads and for protecting children.  There is not a parent who is not worried by that problem.  I do not know what the statistics are here but in England it is estimated that someone is killed once in every 90 minutes on the roads and injured once in every 2.  The toll of the roads is rising here and the problem is a very serious one.  Something has to be done.</P>
      <P>Clearly the Gardaí at their present strength, in the City of Dublin anyway &mdash;I do not know about the country position&mdash;cannot do anything more than they are doing; they are straining themselves to carry out their duties at the present time.  Considering that they are being pressed in regard to crimes such as housebreaking, traffic control imposes a very heavy burden on them and the control of school children is almost beyond them.  However, the problem must be faced and it has to be faced by providing personnel to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> We shall have to find the personnel, to pay the personnel and to invest them with the necessary powers.  The question is whether the proposal contained in this section is the right way to approach the problem.  Is the best way to put the onus on the local authorities, to absolve the police, so to speak, because that appears to be the proposal in this sub-section, and to leave aside the question of who is going to pay for it?  Quite obviously there is no reference there to charging the burden on the Department of Justice or on anybody related to it. The reading of the section is that a council or a corporation may, with the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, make arrangements for the appointment of these wardens but if it is a question of payment, the burden will fall on the local authority. The control is with the local authority. I am wondering if that is wise.  My own solution would be&mdash;the Minister says it would cost a good amount&mdash;to increase the police force.  In the long run it would be good for the morale of the force.  There would be more opportunity for promotion and there would be uniformity.  However, that is beyond the scope of this section.</P>
    <P>If there are to be wardens, why not have them as assistants or auxiliaries to the police.  Certain powers are given them here but, if they are to be effective, the wardens must be invested with all the powers of the police force. I am rather hazy on the question&mdash; perhaps Deputy M.J. O'Higgins would help me&mdash;of the particular protection a police officer has against an individual in the enforcement of the law.  He has some privileges and rights.  He can do certain things with an immunity that the ordinary person does not possess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have forgotten the precise law on that problem.  The point I make is that these men who will be controlling traffic will need all the powers and the rights of a police <Col N="1375" /> officer including the power to prosecute. A traffic offence at a crossing is from one point of view, much more serious than a traffic offence at any other part of the road.  At any other part of the road, you assume that people generally will take reasonable care, but here we are dealing with children who cannot have imposed on them the duty of taking care.  I see defects in the drafting of the section but, above all, I see a defect in its implementation.  If we had a straightforward simple clause providing that the Garda Síochána would appoint the necessary wardens it would be much better.  If they are to be part-time personnel, then let them be part-time attached to the Garda and invested with the necessary powers.  I think that Deputy Briscoe mentioned that car park attendants were actually under Garda control and it is much more satisfactory that they should be. I rather wonder whether it is wise to invest our local authorities with this power.  I wonder is there any possibility that there has been some confusion of thought due to the fact that in England the police forces are local?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very nebulous provision.  It is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  I think the drafting of the section is very weak. One objection which I know the Minister has to my suggestions is that he is only Minister for Local Government <Col N="1376" /> and not Minister for Justice, but if it is a matter of Government policy then it is a matter for the Government as a whole to consider.  Surely the Government could agree among themselves on a matter which is non-contentious?  I really think this is too nebulous to work effectively.  If the local authorities are to have an efficient system of traffic control, if this is not going to be something which may be, as it will be unless there are prosecutions, a sham, unless the law is enforced and offenders are prosecuted, these matters must be attended to.  It is all right to say that these wardens are to be part-time but if there are offences and prosecutions afterwards, an efficient warden will soon find himself a whole-time officer with serious responsibilities. If the local authority is to carry the cost it will mean that you are saddling them with a local police force. I see no purpose in this duplication. This is one of the things which at first blush looks to be very nice but if it is to be done effectively under these proposals, it will mean that the cost will fall on the local authority.  In my opinion the thing could be done more effectively under the aegis of the normal police force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I think there is a lot in the arguments put up by Deputy de Valera, in my view he is using a battering ram to swat a fly. This section, in fact, deals only with particular places which may be nominated by the local authority where school children cross roads.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned the advisability of extending that for other purposes, where there might be major functions, a horse show or something like that, in the city at which the services of these wardens might be useful.  I do not think that we should overlook the fact that the section deals with only one particular problem, the problem which exists in the City of Dublin, of the danger involved in school children crossing roads.  I think any of us who have to drive through the city a few times a week, would be able to nominate two or three points where we consider such wardens should be on duty.  In most of these places there are members of the Garda Síochána on <Col N="1377" /> duty at the moment.  There might be a legitimate difference of opinion as to whether the local authorities or the Department should have control of these wardens.  I should like to point out that I think it would be a mistake in the discussion of this section to allow ourselves to go over the whole field of traffic control because that does not arise on this Bill.  I am inclined to agree, having considered it very closely, with the viewpoint that this is an experiment which if started might in the course of time be extended beyond the very limited function which it has under sub-section (1) of Section 38.  I believe the section as it stands certainly meets the point of view put forward by the Dublin Corporation in relation to this matter and that it would be well for this House to give it a trial and see how it works.  I do not think it would be an end to our legislation dealing with road safety.  I do not think it should be an end of it but, as the section stands at the moment, I do not believe there is any doubt but that the section does impose any financial burdens which may be involved on the local authority.  I do not think there can be any two points of view about that.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy de Valera is completely wrong when he regards this section as absolving the Garda Síochána from traffic duties in relation to these particular crossings.  That is not so and it cannot be so.  Even when wardens are appointed at particular speed crossings nominated, my view&mdash; I may be wrong in this&mdash;is that the people responsible are the Garda Síochána and that they will remain responsible. Certain authority is being given under the section to wardens when they are appointed and a particular penalty is imposed if people disregard the authority of the wardens but the officers to enforce the authority, if it is necessary to enforce it, are still the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the contributions made by Deputy de Valera and other Deputies. This section appears to me to be included in the Bill for a specific purpose <Col N="1378" /> and I would suggest that consideration of the section should be confined to that specific purpose, that is, the provision of some form of protection to school children crossing the public highways.</P>
      <P>If I thought for one minute that there was the faintest possibility of this protection being afforded by the Garda Síochána, that is, that all the protection required by school children in the City of Dublin could be provided by the Garda Síochána, I would press on the Minister in the strongest way to delete the section completely. I do not think there is any possibility of this menace to the lives of the children of the city being dealt with by the Garda Síochána even if there were a substantial increase in the Garda Síochána in the City of Dublin. I do not know what number of Gardaí it would require to cover all the schools.  I would hazard a guess that it would possibly require at least the doubling of the present force.  If the Minister can suggest that there is any possibility of this work being carried out by the Garda Síochána, I would ask him to delete the section.</P>
      <P>We are left then with the problem that children going to school in the morning, going home at lunch time, returning after lunch and going home in the evening have to cross the public streets.  Some of the streets they cross, immediately adjacent to the school, are streets in which there is a member of the Garda Síochána already and the problem does not arise.  I have myself observed in Ballyfermot, outside the schools run by the De La Salle Brothers, members of that order acting as traffic wardens, trying to hold up traffic so as to allow the children to pass.  This problem is repeated 100 times in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the section provides for only is that somebody will be authorised to stop traffic to let children cross the road.  I do not think there is any suggestion that the person so authorised will have the training, authority or powers of prosecution of the Garda Síochána and I hope it is not visualised that such wardens as are mentioned in the section would be used for any other purpose, such as controlling <Col N="1379" /> traffic at football matches or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>The only objection I saw to it, frankly, was that there might be a considerable number of these wardens required in the City of Dublin and it would not be fair to ask the local authority to bear all the burden of the cost.</P>
      <P>As to the question of control, their functions would be very limited, and I think the provisions in the Bill are satisfactory.  Obviously, the Gardaí, being the highway authority, would have to satisfy themselves that anyone appointed would be physically capable of doing the work properly.  I would, therefore, again suggest that when the Minister is dealing with the section, possibly on Report or even now, he would indicate whether he would be prepared to bring in some provision which would lighten at least portion of the burden which can be placed on the local authority.</P>
      <P>Failing the adoption of a section such as this to deal with this particular problem, I am afraid it will be a very long time before we get any real form of protection for the children of this city.  It is imperative and it is urgent that protection should be provided before we are compelled to introduce it as a result of fatal accidents to a number of children.</P>

      <P>I think every Deputy in the House agrees that the problem is a vital one as far as Dublin City is concerned.  Everything that has been said about providing extra safety measures for school children is but an understatement of the position.  The only point that troubles me&mdash;and some of the Deputies who have already spoken have stressed it&mdash;is how it is going to be achieved best Is it going to be left to the Gardaí or will it be the job of the local authorities entirely? If the sole responsibility is taken away from the Gardaí so that there is joint responsibility by the Gardaí and the local authorities, I feel that the Gardaí will probably be inclined to pass the buck and I do not see the local authorities, particularly in the City of Dublin, being able to provide an adequate number of wardens.  I think the Minister considers it necessary, and I would ask him to ensure that proper protection is afforded whether by the local authority or the Gardaí.</P>

I also feel that the fitness and equipping of the personnel should be a matter for the Gardaí since it is a matter dealing with an official duty on behalf of the public.  I wonder if the Minister would consider redrafting Section 38&mdash;perhaps I do not know the troublesome implications of this suggestion.  Local authorities are prepared to pay contributions so that this job will be properly done.  Derry has been cited as an example of perfection and I am told that the police regulate the thing there.</P>

      <P>No.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the local authorities will be guided in the making of their arrangements by the Gardaí in a manner which would be considered satisfactory by the Gardaí. That is not asking the Minister to withdraw the section.  It is merely asking that the Gardaí would be more careful in guiding the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It means that the Dublin Corporation, for instance, may request sanction from the Garda Commissioner for the setting up of a particular traffic warden system.  But there is no responsibility attaching to the Gardaí to see that what the local authority will do is efficient.  Deputy de Valera said that if the local authorities take on this job they will have to put on a police force.  I remember when Dublin had a police force&mdash;the Dublin Metropolitan Police&mdash;until it was disbanded.  I am not asking for a police force, but as a responsible member of a local authority I say that even with the assistance of the city manager and the councillors it will be very difficult to organise a proper staff of traffic wardens.  I should like to see the section amended to provide that in addition to getting the sanction of the Gardaí the local authorities would also be subject to the Garda Commissioner's approval so that the efficiency of their system would be guaranteed.  Surely to goodness there can be no objection to that.  If we went any further there would be a conflict between the two <Col N="1383" /> bodies.  The Gardaí have their own duties in connection with regulation of traffic and the local authorities will have their own section of traffic control. There could be a conflict with the Gardaí.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what is said here it is not law until it is specifically recorded in the Bill.  The Minister's goodwill and promises here do not help us once the Bill leaves the House as an Act.  I am asking a very reasonable and sensible thing. All I ask is that on Report Stage we would have permission for an amendment for the added control so as to ensure that the patrolling will be properly executed and so that the personnel will be suitable for the particular job.  Is that unreasonable? We say this section makes provision for a problem the solution of which has been sought for years, but we do not think that the Minister is bringing it in in a way which will make the work easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking the protection of the lives of children going to school.  We have some of the largest schools in Europe in the City of Dublin from the point of view of the number of children who attend these schools and we have not hundreds but thousands of children in some areas leaving a particular <Col N="1384" /> school at the one time.  When it is said that certain of these managerial controllers of the schools are trying to do a certain amount of traffic work, we must admit they cannot possibly do it because it goes further than the mere entrances and exits from the schools themselves.  I am asking the Minister to bear with me, not to misunderstand me or to be at cross-purposes.  All the Bill will ask will be that the local authority notifies the Gardaí authorities: &ldquo;We are going to have some wardens appointed.  We want your consent.&rdquo;  We can ask that and that is all we can get.  I want the Minister to impose this and I am saying this as one who has opposed all through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then I am sure the Minister for Justice would agree with what I am asking for.  The Minister seems to think I am approaching this from a point of view of hostility.  I am not.  I want the Minister to be able to look back on this section as something well done and something of which he can be proud, bringing about the saving of accidents to our young children. I am asking the Minister this because I have been for years concerned, as have other members of the local authority, in trying to get something of this nature put through.  The Department knows that and we have <Col N="1385" /> some knowledge of what we want.  Unless the Minister meets the point I have suggested he is going to have an unsatisfactory situation certainly as far as the City of Dublin is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I would like to make has already been mentioned by several Deputies.  One of the ways to see this working properly is to make sure that when there has been a real breach of the section prosecution under it is swift and easily done.  It seems to me that where you have a section and where the constituents of the offence under the section are refusal to appoint a traffic warden, unless you add something to the section as it stands you are going to have considerable difficulty in proving who is or who is not a traffic warden.  As I read the section every prosecution would require proof, presumably by some official of the local authority, of the making of an order appointing a person a traffic warden.  If a number of prosecutions have been taken in different cases within the one local authority district, it might be a matter of considerable difficulty to have that and whilst I am against these <i>prima facie</i> proofs generally I would like to suggest that the Minister might consider inserting a further section stating that the issue of a certificate under the seal of the local authority saying the person is traffic warden would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of that under the section.  It does seem to me that the first time you go in to prosecute somebody is going to make the point that in order to prove the evidence you must prove that the person who put up his hand in the particular case was a traffic warden, and then an officer from the local authority must come to court.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be undue hardship on the motorist to have a sub-section to the effect that the seal of the local authority shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence for the purpose of the prosecution and that the person named therein is traffic warden for the purpose of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the arguments put forward by all the Deputies during the last hour and a half in dealing with this <Col N="1386" /> section.  I find they are unanimous that this section is necessary but there are three main objections to it.  The last is put forward by Deputy Finlay that the section should be amended to enable a successful prosecution to be brought.  I have been informed by my legal advisers that it is not necessary to amend the section further.  After all, such prosecutions will be brought by the Gardaí; the traffic warden will be a witness and I think that will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence until contradicted by the defence.  Other objections have been raised principally by Deputy de Valera.  Deputy de Valera says that instead of having traffic wardens we should have extra police.  Deputy Briscoe says we should have traffic wardens but they should be under the control of the police and not under the control of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, their duties. These are the principal arguments against the section, with one exception, that some Deputies have suggested that the cost of providing these traffic wardens should be borne by the National Exchequer and not by the local authority.  Let me, at the outset, point out that there is no compulsion on any local authority to enforce this section.  If they do not wish to incur the expenditure they need not enforce the section.  No later than to-day I caused a letter to be written to the Secretary of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and I think it is right I should read it.  It has to-day's date:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to your letter of the 27th ultimo forwarding a resolution by the executive committee of your association regarding Section 38 of the Local Government Bill, 1954, which deals with traffic wardens and to inform you that this provision was included in the Bill following representations from Dublin Corporation to the effect that they were anxious to have power to appoint such wardens.  It will be noted that each local authority will <Col N="1387" /> be entirely free to decide whether or not to appoint traffic wardens.  The section in no way derogates from the existing general responsibility of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for the control of traffic, and in fact provides that any arrangements made by a local authority under the section must be made with the consent of the Commissioner.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister indicated that the Commissioner would assist in ensuring that wardens are properly instructed.</P>
    <P>I am to add that the provisions of Section 38 have been welcomed by the Safety First Association of Ireland. In other countries traffic wardens are appointed by local authorities under a similar arrangement to that set out in Section 38.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner assured me they would assist in instructing wardens.  As I mentioned, the traffic wardens in the Six Counties are established under Section 51, sub-section (5) of the Education (Northern Ireland) Act 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the conditions and terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to read that out.  The local education authority appoints the wardens in that case.  With regard to this section Deputy Briscoe is correct in saying that Dublin Corporation initiated the proceedings whereby this section is incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not the slightest doubt about it and the Bill, as it stands, is drafted on the basis of the request which we received from Dublin Corporation.  We are very well aware <Col N="1388" /> that at certain hours of the day in Dublin City&mdash;particularly in Dublin City&mdash;there is this traffic danger to school children.  We are also aware that the particular hours coincide with the peak periods of traffic in the city &mdash;mainly during lunch hour in the morning and again in the afternoon. What we propose doing is this: to give the local authorities power to appoint wardens who would attend for, say, half an hour in the morning&mdash;say, between 9 and 9.30&mdash;again for half or three-quarters of a hour at lunch time and for half an hour in the afternoon on five days of the week only.  Deputy de Valera suggests that to procure the services for these school children on these five days of the week, we should recruit Gardaí.  It takes approximately £10 per week to keep a uniformed Garda in this country.  Not only do we pay him when he is in the force but we must also pay him a pension on retirement.  Deputy de Valera suggests that we pay him a salary and give him a pension and let this gentleman, this Garda, be employed merely for two or less than two hours per day for five days of the week.  He says that it should be the function of the State to provide such Gardaí for this traffic.  Deputy de Valera knows very well that if a Garda is employed he is paid out of the National Exchequer&mdash;and Cork, Galway and every village and town in Ireland will demand the same services because it is costing nothing.  Remember, we try to employ sufficient Gardaí to do the ordinary police work of the State.  If we employ these additional Gardaí, what will they do during the other six or seven hours of the day when they are not occupied on this traffic work?  The suggestion is ridiculous from a financial and an efficiency point of view so far as Gardaí are concerned.</P>
    <P>We really intend to provide these wardens through the local authority and the local authority may decide that a dust coat, a cap, an arm-band or some insignia such as that will be sufficient for the purpose.  What would the Deputies representing the rest of Ireland have to say about financing those traffic wardens of Dublin? Probably in at least 20 of the constituencies <Col N="1389" /> of this country where there will be no necessity for them at all we may hear the question: Why should we have to finance them?  Again, if they are under the direct control of the Commissioner of the Gardaí&mdash;if he has the appointment of them, as Deputy Briscoe suggests&mdash;he could appoint one for every crossing and even sometimes where it is not considered necessary, just because the cost is coming out of the National Exchequer.  On the other hand, if the local authority have to pay these men, should they not have some say in the appointment of the personnel of the posts which they are going to occupy in the city?  I think it is reasonable that they should.  I have dealt with the main objections to the section.  The section was welcomed by all the Deputies who spoke.  I have dealt with the objections to it and I wish now publicly to express my thanks to the Dublin Corporation for making the suggestion that such a section should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent I am rather amused by the Minister's approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It was fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The naïveté of the approach is perhaps the trouble. Here is a problem.  The Minister is apparently now, in a case like this where there is a burden, only too anxious to pass the whole load on, say, to the Dublin Corporation and forget about it as quickly as possible.  The Minister made a case which, superficially, sounded all right.  He said it is ridiculous to suggest that it is economic or efficient to augment the Gardaí.  These kinds of statements can be made off the cuff very easily. However, if you are going to have a separate organisation, remember that any organisation has overheads, be it in Dublin or elsewhere, so let us reckon the costs.  One of the advantages of doing it within the Garda machine is that it is the same type of work as ordinary police work and the overheads are there already.  Secondly, you may say a whole-time Garda is going to be expensive.  How expensive are these wardens going to be if they are to be efficient?  I take it we are <Col N="1390" /> sincere about this.  There is a desperate and worrying problem here. The lives of children are at stake. Obviously, we are not enacting this merely as eye-wash or as a sop to some safety-first association.  We mean it.  We want to protect the children.  We want an efficient service.  Let all Deputies remember that, no matter what you say about the Gardaí and the deficiencies of the present moment, there is a pretty good protection going on in the city up to the limit of what the Gardaí can do.  If the Minister wants me to do so, I will give him, straight away, examples of it.  See what the Gardaí are doing at peak traffic at Townsend Street or at Donnybrook where there is a murderous crossing at, say, Belmont Avenue.  Go out at the school time and you will find Gardaí on the job.  There is a very efficient service being given at the moment. My fear is that we will lose the efficient service we are getting from the Gardaí at the moment under this section, without getting anything effective to replace it.  The case I am making in reply to the Minister's references to whole-time expenses is that if you are going to have an efficient warden organisation&mdash;an organisation that will be more efficient than the service the Gardaí are giving at the moment; there is no point in doing it if they cannot do it well&mdash;you will have overheads.  You will have to pay these men if they are going to be efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a fair representation of the situation for the Minister to say that the wardens will be occupied for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening.  If there is going to be effect there is going to be prosecution, and if there is going to be prosecution the wardens will have to be witnesses, anyway, whether prosecutors or not.  Before you know it, there will be a substantial amount of time taken up in the work of these wardens.  Let the Minister consider a few economic points here when he talks about its being cheap.  You want the right type of personnel.  If you are going to get the right type of personnel to be available just at the school hours, to be available for prosecutions, to be available at the times for the efficient <Col N="1391" /> carrying out of that duty, you will have to pay them a commensurate sum.  It would be futile on our part to think we are getting away with it by paying a few shillings here and there.  You will not be far short of full-time pay in the general sense&mdash;and God knows our Gardaí are not overpaid for the duties they render the community.  The rate of pay of a Garda is not very much higher than the rate of pay of many relatively lowly-placed employees in this country.  I would say that the disparity will by no means be in favour of the Minister's suggestion as against the suggestion that Gardaí should do the job here.  Let the uniform provision cancel out.  However, no matter what your uniform is, even if it is only an arm-band, it will cost something and even if it is provided by the State machinery it will cost something. There will be repercussions the whole way right up to the Custom House on the administrative side.  Let us see the hidden costs.  Straight away there is a new function for the local authority and the local authority has to pay for it.  There will be adding, accounting and all the other machinery right up to the top involved in all this.  Having regard to the services the Gardaí are at present providing I am not at all satisfied that the comparison can be dismissed as lightly as the Minister dismissed it with the word: &ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; I think there is food for thought here, particularly for the local authorities who will have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>I will not enter into the merits of the situation of Dublin Corporation in regard to this section.  That body has taken it upon themselves to make a very responsible and serious recommendation to the Minister and the citizens of Dublin will be very interested and will hold the councillors and members of the Dublin Corporation responsible, should any action be taken on this, if the Minister succeeds in saddling the whole cost for this provision on them.</P>
    <P>What is involved?  The first and most cardinal point is the protection of the children.  Say what you like about the Gardaí, the children are getting protection <Col N="1392" /> in large measure at the moment from that body.  They are getting all the protection the Gardaí can give them, and that is no mean contribution at the moment.  That fact alone will make parents and others wonder whether anything that may have the effect of withdrawing that protection &mdash;in effect that is what will happen under this, though I know it is not the law but rather in the administrative nature of things&mdash;is worth while.  One cannot blame the Gardaí if responsibility is thrown over on the local authority by this provision, especially when they are under strength, for not taking on extra duties and for asking local authorities to carry their proper burden, if it is their proper burden; and, remember, under this provision it will be their proper burden.  Citizens will be anxious to ensure that they get at least the service they are getting at the moment.  They will be worried about that end of it.  I am sure the councillors will be just as worried and just as anxious.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there will be an awful lot in the difference in the long run in so far as expense is concerned.  If there is not much difference, then the principle of allowing the police to do their own job, and giving them the strength to do it, is one that I recommend very very strongly to the Minister.  Apart from that, perhaps there is some merit in the Minister's argument that these may be legal problems and the problem on the country roads will be a less serious one than that in Dublin.  But sometimes the country roads are more dangerous for children than some of the city streets.  Be that as it may, it may be that there is a case for saddling local authorities with the expense. Again, I would prefer to see that in the nature of a levy towards the police and I would prefer to see the police force built up as it should be built up. I am wondering if the citizens of Dublin will be prepared for the expense that may be involved in the effective&mdash; note the word, because you can make a gesture, and it is very easy to make a gesture&mdash;implementation of what is envisaged under this section.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister and I must agree to differ but I think if the economic <Col N="1393" /> content is examined in detail there will not be as much disparity between the proposal the Minister advances and our proposal that the Gardaí should do it.  Remember, there are other duties upon which the Gardaí can be engaged.  They would not be whole-time on this job of protection. They would be available for duty at the peak hours of traffic or in helping in a round-up, as occasionally happens. One of the difficulties they have to face at the moment is the fact that if there are burglaries in a particular locality it is not always easy to get enough Gardaí on the job at the particular time.  That type of problem would seem to demand a pool in excess of what is available at the moment and the extra appointments could be absorbed in that way.  I am not satisfied that this proposal is the cheapest or most efficient; neither do I believe that the local authorities will get an adequate return for their anxiety and their gesture in wanting to take over this <i>vis-à-vis</i> the expense that will be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has informed us that Dublin Corporation took the initiative in asking for the setting up of a force such as that envisaged in this section; that was done only in the interests of the children in the City of Dublin.  I was very, very disappointed with the Minister's approach to the point I raised as to the possibility of the State bearing some portion of the financial burden. The Minister put a query as to whether the children of citizens in about 20 different constituencies would not be enjoying the benefit of the protection and suggested they should be called upon to bear some of the burden.  The population in this city is 550,000 and very few are Dublin born.</P>

      <P>Not only are these children living in this city, but they are Irish children.  Surely the question of their protection is a matter of concern not only for the people of Dublin but for this House.  I draw that point again to the Minister's attention.  I do not think we can get away from the basic <Col N="1394" /> fact that in the absence of the force of wardens which it is proposed to permit local authorities to establish under this Bill the responsibility for protection will inevitably fall back on the Gardaí. That does not require any proof other than the simple statement of fact.  The Garda Síochána are responsible for the traffic arrangements.</P>

If it is possible to supplement the Garda Síochána by setting up this specific type of warden, I think that is a good thing.  The duties of these wardens will be strictly limited to the protection of children crossing roads.  Their only duty will be to stop traffic.  Nevertheless, they will be performing a function that may well be part of the function of the Garda Síochána, and I appeal to the Minister in dealing with this matter to accept once more that this is not entirely and solely the responsibility of the local authority.  It may be the responsibility of that authority to decide whether wardens are necessary in a particular area.  If it is so decided, I submit it is also the responsibility of this House to see that the burden is shared equally, because in this case, in Dublin they are not children of this city and in Cork they are not children of Cork City.  Basically they are Irish children.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin is right in stating that basically this is a police matter.  I am sorry the Minister has left the House because I wanted to draw his attention to the Northern Ireland Act.  I do not know that the Northern Ireland Act has worked as well as all that, but assuming it has, if you compare the sections, in Section 38 it is the local authority here that is concerned.  In Section 51 of the Educational Act of Northern Ireland it is the local education authority that is tied up in the scheme.</P>

      <P>It is the local authority but it is the local authority in its functioning in regard to education. In that connection, there is a different approach here.  You can tie this to the educational system or you can tie it to the police system, but to put it at large under the local authority to my mind makes the thing rather different, and I am not very happy about it.  It is not that we want to quibble about the words to be used.  I am afraid the debate has gone very wide in its ramifications, but to get down to the point I made earlier, I do not think that the section is going to be effective.  The intention is all right but the actual wording, particularly of sub-section (1), will not I think make it effective.  Deputy Finlay's amendment is one which will help to improve it, but the scheme outlined in sub-section (1) which empowers the local authority is merely permissive.  As the Minister says, he intends it to be that way.  I shall not dilate on the use of the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but it is permissive.  The local authority may make arrangements, and it can only make arrangements on the wording of this section, by using persons &ldquo;employed or nominated by them.&rdquo; That is the way the section is worded. Therefore, the local authority has to employ or nominate the persons who are to make these arrangements.  They have only to get the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda.  The Commissioner has no further interest in the matter or no further responsibility.  I feel, however, that the section is likely to be quite ineffective in practice.</P>

      <P>I have been here for an hour listening to this debate, and I understand from what the Minister has said that it is now close on two hours since it started.  Is it not obvious that these wardens will not be police officers in any sense of the term?  We all appreciate the work that is being done by the members of the Garda Síochána in this matter.  As a matter of fact I imagine&mdash;it does not require much imagination&mdash;that retired members of that force would be amongst the most suitable people for carrying on this work.  Deputy de <Col N="1396" /> Valera in his latest statement made some references to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Is it not obvious that it is permissive here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a final appeal to the Minister.  Many people have pointed out that we have been watching the clock on this particular section.  First of all, I appreciate the fact that the Minister has indicated that this problem first came to the notice of the Department on a request from the Dublin Corporation.  May I say to him that we did not just make that request without considering how it could be operated and under what terms and conditions?  The Minister in Section 38 has used a certain phraseology which has been referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.  It sets out that if the local authority wishes to set up machinery, it can secure the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The Parliamentary Secretary states that that implies usually that it will have to be on the basis of a proposition put up and approved of by the Commissioner.  The Minister was good enough to send over here the volume containing the 1947 Northern Education Act.  Sub-section (5) of section 51 of that Act sets out that, with a view to assisting in the prevention of road accidents to children proceeding to and from school, the local authority may in accordance with a scheme framed by the authority and approved by the Commissioner carry into effect such measures as may be set out in the scheme.  That is somewhat different from the words used in our Bill.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has adverted to that.</P>

      <P>I have experience of the difference between them.  If we approach the Garda Commissioner and ask him for permission to set up a traffic warden system, he may not say to us: &ldquo;Yes, provided I am satisfied that it will work.&rdquo;  He may say that, but he is not bound to say it.  What I am asking is to make it incumbent, before we secure consent from the Garda Commissioner, that he shall satisfy himself that the arrangements we are making, both the physical arrangements and the arrangements in regard to personnel, will appear to have some hope of success.  At the beginning of the discussion on this section, I said that we pointed out that this type of work will mainly, if not altogether, be done, although there may be some head warden, on some very small part-time basis.  I think I said earlier, I do not know whether the Minister agrees or not, that the best type of officer for this particular class of work would be a pensioned member of the Garda or an ex-member of the I.R.A.</P>

I referred to Northern Ireland and the distinction between the method of selecting the personnel up there and that which the Government proposes down here.  The time factor will arise there.  We have schools in different areas which have different hours for commencing work and different hours for lunch.  Some of them have a break at lunch time.</P>

He will agree with me that if all schools operated exactly at the same time then the half-hour in the morning and the half-hour at lunch-time and the half-hour in the afternoon would suffice but there are some schools that close later than others; there are some schools that have a lunch-time break, when the children go home.  So that you may have one warden doing two jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that there is quite a number of differences in hours. We are not tying this to what the Northern Government has described as &ldquo;grant-aided schools&rdquo;.  We are tying it to &ldquo;schools&rdquo;, which includes schools different from the ordinary national schools.</P>
      <P>I regard this as primarily a responsibility, as Deputy Denis Larkin has pointed out, of the Garda Síochána because they are the responsible authority for traffic regulations and traffic generally in the City of Dublin and you cannot have two authorities.  The wardens must operate under the Garda arrangements.  I agree with Deputy Larkin that it is wrong for the Minister to say that because Dublin City local authority, in the interest of the safety of children, requested facilities for such an operation they should have to bear the full brunt of the cost.  I go this far and say that Deputy de Valera has rightly said that if we were able to have out of our resources a sufficiently large Garda Force to meet all our needs this would be one of their jobs and we would not have this particular situation to-day.  It is because we recognise that there is a limit to the taxable capacity of our people, a limit to the number of people that can be employed, even as Gardaí, that this idea was thought out as a contribution to a saving in the cost of providing protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Larkin will continue to press that the question of cost be discussed.  We are quite willing to bear portion of it, but the full cost <Col N="1399" /> should not be put on the shoulders of the local authority on the ground given by the Minister that portion of the cost might then fall on areas outside the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the Bill delayed. I do not like the Bill at all.  I would like to see an amendment of the old Act, bringing in this particular section. I and other Deputies have tried to point out to the Minister that an arrangement must be made which will guarantee the efficient performance of the particular duty, that there are safeguards as to the type of person to be engaged as warden, the vetting of each individual one by the Garda authorities.  Then we will have some chance of success.  Otherwise, we will be back again probably amending the Bill as a result of experience.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to say, even if it is only for the sake of pacifying me, that he will consider this between now and Report Stage and, if there is a gleam of anything in the points we have put up, that he will be prepared to consider it.</P>

As I understand it, for the construction of bridges, the Department of Local Government, out of the Road Fund, can give a contribution up to 75 per cent.  It is pertinent for me to ask, if they can give a contribution up to 75 per cent., have they powers under this Bill to dictate to us to put a swivel bridge there instead of a permanent bridge and, if they have that power, have they further power to dictate to us to pay a caretaker in Athlone to lift that swivel bridge and to pay his sucessor and his successors successor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of those who is very perturbed at the idea that there was even a remote possibility that the Shannon should be closed for navigation, I should like to point out to Deputy Kennedy that I think he is mistaken in thinking that the building of a fixed bridge in Athlone would in any way affect any yacht or yacht club in Athlone and in the neighbourhood or elsewhere.  The position is that the <Col N="1402" /> Shannon is one of the most navigable highways in Europe.  The history of industrial development has shown that in every country industrial development inevitably follows the course of the main waterways.  Short as our own history is in respect of industrial development, I think Deputy Kennedy will realise, as every other Deputy must, that the development of Athlone in the last 25 years as an industrial centre is due practically entirely to the fact that it is on the River Shannon. The development of Limerick is also due to the fact that it is on one of the main water highways.</P>
      <P>To build a fixed bridge in Athlone or anywhere else on the Shannon would be, in effect, to throttle one of the best commercial water highways we have and to prevent its use ever afterwards, particularly at a moment when, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, there are proposals being considered to run regular passenger services on the Shannon which would enable the tourist development of nine counties that at present are practically derelict from the tourist point of view.  It would be the height of folly to build anything that would interfere with that proposal.  Apart from that, Deputy Kennedy will remember that, during the war, the transport of fuel and of numerous other materials was largely dependent upon the availability of water transport&mdash;of the canals and of the Shannon itself, so that, even apart from the question of proposals for the development of the Shannon from the tourist point of view, the Shannon is certainly one of the main highways which we should keep open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water transport is still by far the cheapest form of transport available. It is the most economical form of transport, and I am afraid that very often we are inclined to overlook the fact that the maintenance of a water highway such as the Shannon, which is 150 miles long, does not cost anything. You do not have to steam-roll the Shannon, you do not have to lay a new surface on it.  It keeps itself and not only does it pay for itself but it makes a slight profit because the lock fees and the dues payable at the moment and collected by the Board of <Col N="1403" /> Works more than pay for the maintenance costs.  This means that we have 150 miles of a highway, one of the best water highways in Europe, which does not cost the State anything to maintain, which is a lifeline in the event of an emergency and which provides an artery for industrial development, as well as holding prospects for important tourist development in an area where there is little or none at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy should consider these points very carefully before he opposes the amendment which the Minister has put down.  I think he is also mistaken in suggesting to the House that this amendment by the Minister is in any way altering the position as it now is.  In very different circumstances over 100 years ago in the year of Our Lord 1839 in the reign of Queen Victoria, after very considerable agitation by the nationalists here, an Act was passed to safeguard the navigation of the River Shannon, and I think it would be well if I read the provisions of Section 36 of the Shannon Navigation Act of 1839:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And be it enacted and declared, that the said River Shannon is and forever hereafter shall be, to all intents and purposes a public navigable river; and that all the Queen's liege subjects may have and lawfully enjoy their free passage in, along, through, and upon the said River Shannon with boats, barges, lighters, and other vessels, and also all necessary and convenient liberties for navigating the same, without let, hindrance, or obstruction whatever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the charter of the River Shannon.  That is a charter which was granted not by an Irish Government but by an English Government to the River Shannon.  Are we now, 100 years later, to come along and destroy this amenity, this huge highway which does not cost anything to maintain, which has helped the industrial development of Limerick and Athlone, and which, I hope, will be the artery for the industrial development of Carrick-on-Shannon <Col N="1404" /> as well.  I think, for these reasons, the Minister is to be congratulated for having altered the original bridge contained in the Bill as drafted and for excepting the River Shannon from the provisions of that Bill.  I am not sure&mdash;I am subject to correction&mdash; but my impression is that, under the Shannon Navigation Acts the Westmeath County Council can recoup themselves to a large extent in the case of a swivel bridge being built by them.  It is a matter to be looked up, but I think I am right in that, which means there will be no additional burden on the Westmeath County Council.  Presumably the Westmeath County Council would withdraw some of their revenue from the people of Athlone.</P>
    <P>The population of Athlone has grown considerably during the past number of years by reason of its situation on the Shannon and by reason of the fact that the Shannon has enabled the industrial development of Athlone.  Therefore, it would be penny wise and pound foolish to build a fixed bridge on the Shannon.  In addition to that, it would affect not only the people of Athlone but of the nine counties which border the Shannon&mdash;Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Galway, Offaly, Westmeath, Roscommon, Longford, Leitrim.  These are all counties that depend on the Shannon, and I feel that, inevitably, in the course of the next few years, particularly if a passenger service is started on the Shannon, that the river will provide an important source of revenue for the tourist development of these counties.</P>
    <P>It would be the height of folly at this stage to throttle this development by building a fixed bridge.  It is ludicrous to suggest that it has anything to do with yachts or yacht clubs. There is not one yacht on Lough Ree that would be hindered by a fixed bridge, but heavy cargo boats would be hindered.  There is one boat which goes from Limerick to Carrick-on-Shannon carrying flour which would be held up.  That body provides a large portion of the revenue that keeps the Shannon works going.  If fixed bridges are built it may even prevent the existing services from being maintained. It would certainly prevent the <Col N="1405" /> initiation of any greater use of the Shannon; it would prevent the use of bigger boats on the Shannon both for transport of goods and for the transport of passengers.  Obviously if these passenger boats are to be run they would have to be of fairly reasonable size to carry about 1,300 passengers. They would have to provide the usual amenities that river boats of that nature should provide.  It might be possible to build a boat that would get adequate clearance at the Athlone bridge, but once the Charter of the Shannon is repealed, and that is the effect of Section 41 as it stood originally, it means that all the other bridges will also be closed; for instance, eight feet is the clearance of the Portumna bridge which would certainly prevent any form of commercial vessel using the Shannon.  Therefore, I would ask Deputy Kennedy to realise that he would be really doing something which is unnatural and contrary to the interests of the people in Westmeath and in every county that borders along the Shannon by even urging there might be any obstruction built across the Shannon at Athlone or anywhere else.  This is a matter of real importance, and the Minister is to be congratulated on having by his amendment protected the liberties of the Shannon.</P>

      <P>Personally, I agree that the Shannon should be kept open but there is a point I would like to ask the Minister on this.  The Minister is making an express saver for the Shannon here.  Am I right in law in this, that the position is that in regard to a navigable river or waterway the authority is in the Minister at the moment and will be in the Minister? In other words, the Minister has the power to say: &ldquo;Yes, you can build that bridge even though it obstructs navigation&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;No, that bridge must be built in a way so as not to hinder navigation&rdquo;?  That power is still there?</P>

What I am asking is: Why only the Shannon?  On the other hand, if you are going to take power from the Minister, going to put the saver in, why not for other sections?  Might it not be better to put it this way: &ldquo;Save where the Government think it expedient.&rdquo; Take the case of the Liffey east of Butt Bridge.  Some years ago Butt Bridge was an opening bridge. The railway bridge was built at a higher level but even that stopped the larger boats.  For the future it is going to be necessary to provide bridging facilities on the Liffey further east than Butt Bridge.  Is it to be a fixed or swivel structure?  If it is going to be a fixed structure it will mean the sacrifice of a certain amount of valuable berthing in the vicinity of the Custom House.  I am putting that in by way of example to show that there are other rivers as well to be considered. I cannot see the logic of specifically excepting the Shannon as such, although I am all for what the Minister wants to do for the Shannon but not for quite the same reasons as Deputy MacBride.</P>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly right in his intention in this but I can see there are other waterways in this country, estuaries or parts of waterways that might need a similar protection and that merely a restriction of this protection to the Shannon alone is either unnecessary or not wide enough.  I cannot pursue that very much further with the Minister at the moment but perhaps he would note what I am saying on this.  There is a very real danger of doing the economic thing at the moment to the detriment of the future.  Some years ago we took up half the line from Dublin to Galway and that was in the opinion of many a disastrous action.</P>

      <P>And during the emergency we suffered for it.  It was a <Col N="1407" /> thing that caused a certain amount of embarrassment.  Generally speaking, it was not a good thing to have done and it was one of those things which when done is not easily undone.  The building of fixed bridges over the Shannon or Liffey in certain portions or over a number of other navigable waterways would be precisely the same type of thing.  Therefore, I am all with the Minister in putting in this amendment. I do not know whether he could get a broader formula.  Deputy MacBride surprised me in the way he faced the case.  I do not know whether there is any substantial passenger or commercial traffic&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not think there was any substantial amount. However, we cannot be quite sure of the potentialities of the Shannon.  It is a valuable waterway and should not be permanently blocked in its navigation, just as our canals should be kept open even though they may be carrying no traffic.  If nothing more, they are a source of water for Dublin in an emergency.  I do not think there is any need to prolong the discussion.  I do not think Deputy MacBride can make a case for the moment very easily.  In principle I cannot see this provision doing any harm.  I can see it safeguarding the future.  Then in regard to paying for the extra cost of a bridge perhaps in the case of a waterway like that some formula could be got whereby all the interested parties in the particular area served could be made to bear the cost.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene for a moment to express my appreciation of the Minister's action in this particular matter in connection with the river Shannon.  He is showing by his action a very admirable attitude that has been very lacking in public life for quite a while.  It is an extraordinary thing that a measure of this nature could not come before the House some 12 months ago so that similar provisions could be made to enable bridges to be built on the Corrib.  I do not propose to deal with that now except to say it rivals the <Col N="1408" /> Shannon.  The tragic position we have today is that in the last three months' programme concrete bridges have been erected and all the huge Corrib basin is cut off from the sea for all time.</P>
      <P>Taking the broad view, as Deputy de Valera said, we should consider that much criticism of a justifiable nature has been levied at the action of our old enemies, the British, for the way they treated this country. When we consider that they believed it was of importance to the State and to the benefit of the community to erect expensive swivel bridges across the Shannon and other rivers, why should we, for the sake of saving a few paltry pounds, now decide to replace these swivel bridges with permanent constructions.  I wish to add my voice to that of Deputy MacBride and to thank the Minister for this particular action he has taken.</P>

      <P>If the central authority considers it is necessary in an emergency to have swivel bridges over certain waterways, including the Shannon, let them make provision for that emergency and let it be a national charge.  As far as I can recollect, the utilisation for a very short period, with a limited amount of transport, of our canals was borne by the central authority.  In the same way, if the Shannon is needed in the case of an emergency&mdash;and I doubt if it will be needed or that it will serve any purpose&mdash;let the central authority bear the expense of these swivel bridges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride exaggerated, to say the least of it, when he attributed the success of the industrial development of Athlone to the fact that it is situated on a navigable waterway. There is not one bale of cotton material which is manufactured by the 600 well-paid workers in the Athlone Company that is transported on a waterway and very few of them, I am sorry to say, on the railways.  The whole tendency is to use the roads.  Last night, when coming to Dublin, I passed a vehicle on the Athlone road.  I could not give you the dimensions of it but there were three lights on it.  It could only travel by night because it took up three-quarters of the road.  Every-thing <Col N="1409" /> is being pitched on to the roads. No matter what you do for tourists, or anything else, the people are roadminded.</P>

      <P>The swivel bridge as it is there at present is such that any barge that goes up or down the Shannon, any barge that is based on the Shannon, can pass under it.  If you make a concrete and permanent bridge it can do the same.  Any rowing boat, any boat with an engine in it, any form of river transport at present&mdash;and it is very limited&mdash;goes under these bridges.  Deputy MacBride spoke of a recent tour by people interested in the development of the Shannon waterways and said that they could not get under the bridge.  I submit that that was due to the abnormal weather we have been having and the flooding of the river. It is not a thing that happens every year.  Practically everybody in this House has seen bridges such as London Bridge and also the types of permanent bridges over the Thames. We have all seen the smoke-stacks and the taller erections on the boats being lowered to enable them to go under the permanent bridges.  That being so, it can be done in the case of the Shannon.  This matter could be argued over until morning.  I am concerned with the rate-paying public in my county.  I am speaking for the ratepayers of Athlone.</P>

      <P>Coming to the point of view of the amendment, I should just like to say that I was out in the Middle East some years ago, and I came across an area where they were still doing their drawing of water in accordance with a method that existed in the days of the Pharaohs.  This swivel bridge controversy does not arise in modern highly-populated areas because, there, they construct a bridge sufficiently high to allow large ships to get under it without any problem at all. We were confronted with that particular situation in consideration of new bridges in Dublin City.  We made up our minds that, as far as possible, we will get away from the swivel or the opening bridge by building, if we can manage it, with a sufficient rise on both sides what we we regarded as an antiquated system.  If you have a swivel or swing bridge you are bound to hold up the traffic on land while you are doing this other work.  It all depends on the type of bridge, the machinery or the equipment you have, or the personnel.  You may have a long delay, too, on the road.</P>

Under the Act of 1946, the Minister for Local Government cannot make a Bridge Order affecting one of these bodies without the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and there is a similar safeguard regarding amendments of bridge Orders.  The Bill, as introduced, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make ancillary Orders regarding the future maintenance of a bridge and regarding approach roads.  This amendment is designed to ensure that the protection of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in favour of harbour authorities and railway authorities and canal companies will apply to these ancillary Orders in the same way as it extends to the Bridge Order itself.</P>

      <P>Before we pass this section, I would like the Minister to explain to me, or tell me if I am wrong in my assumptions or suspicions, the second paragraph of the explanation to Section 41.  I am of the opinion that the Minister is now taking power under this section once <Col N="1413" /> more to take from one bridge authority the responsibility for a bridge, the building of it or the handing over of it after it has been built to another authority.  I would like Deputies to bear in mind what I am about to say. For some years the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which is regarded as a bridge authority, had a right to build a bridge or bridges across the Liffey, and if they completed the job by a certain time, that was all right; if, however at the end of a certain period they had not completed or started the job then the responsibility devolved on the Dublin Local Authority in conjunction with the Dublin County Council.  There are three authorities combined.  First of all, I would like to point out that under the existing laws, if the Minister has the power to say to the Dublin Port and Docks Board that he is making them the bridge authority in order to build a bridge across the Liffey the City of Dublin has to pay 90 per cent of the cost and the county has to pay 10 per cent. The authority that designs the bridge and builds it and has no responsibility for the cost does not even have to consult the other authorities either as to design or cost.  Now that particular right lapsed and I am now asking the Minister if he is restoring that right to the Dublin Port and Docks Board? If the Minister says I am wrong in my assumption, my argument is ended. If he says I am right, I shall have to argue at considerable length against this device to restore to the Dublin Port and Docks Board the right to build a bridge across the River Liffey, with no regard whatever to the ratepayers, the citizens or the authority in which that port authority is situated and without regard to the ordinary day-to-day traffic requirements of the people.</P>

      <P>I thought somebody else might wish to say something about it.  I do not want to go into too much detail, but this amendment deals with <Col N="1417" /> a matter in regard to which we have had a considerable amount of difficulty in the past.  We are simply asking in this amendment that Section 78 of the Act of 1946 be amended by the deletion of sub-sections (2) and (3).  We have had, as I said, many difficulties in regard to the naming of streets.  Perhaps the Minister would state simply his views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister intervenes, I should like to say that this question of the renaming of streets has been a very awkward problem here in Dublin.  There is at present a very cumbersome method in operation which almost involves the carrying out of a miniature election to ascertain whether or not the residents of a street are in favour of the proposed change of name. When the Deputy speaks of a simple majority, is that related to a big business street where some firms spend a considerable amount of money on their business premises?  It could easily happen that they might lose in a contest on the question of the changing of the name of the street, if it were to be decided by a simple majority of the residents, as a simple majority could be made up mainly of persons who were not so interested in the business of the street.  We have had considerable discussions about this matter in our local authority.  We have had a great deal of experience in regard to it and we have been hoping that some simpler method of taking a ballot would be devised because, as matters stand at present, you have to set up an election machine for the residents of the street, if it is desired to have the existing name changed or to change a new name which you may have put on a street in a new housing area.  The mover, in the first part of his amendment, suggests that the change of name should be brought about as a result of a simple majority, ascertained by a vote amongst the residents of the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I thought that the Minister would be generous enough, because he has been so generous in regard to many items in this debate, to consider the matter. If Deputy Briscoe would read the amendment, he would see quite clearly <Col N="1418" /> that we are asking that in future this matter should be decided by a simple majority of the council.  Mark you, we are even giving consideration to the so-called gentlemen who object to certain ancient and glorious names, as they view them, being removed from certain streets.  We are told that it is unfair that names associated with certain historical events such as the name of Lord Pembroke, should be removed from certain streets, and that it would be a shocking thing to do so.  It must be recognised that, according to the principles of democracy, as we view it, the members of a local authority have much more right to have a say in these matters than those residents of the street who consider that it would be profaning some glorious and illustrious names to remove them from these streets in our cities, towns and even in some of our villages.  We ask that a simple majority of the council, if they so decide, should have the right to name a street and forget about the Pembrokes and the others.  However, as may be seen from the amendment, even though the name of the street is changed by a simple majority of the council, they must get the consent of the responsible Minister.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a certain redress provided for those loyal and glorious people who may express horror or who may be worried about the names given to certain streets.  I can recall a time when the Cork Corporation, of which I may say I am not a member, in their wisdom, considered that it was far more appropriate to have names such as those of Connolly, Pearse and MacDonagh associated with certain streets and some of the local gentry were very disturbed about it.  If these people wish to object now we are making provision for them in this amendment by saying that they shall have the right of appeal to the Minister. I think that is a straightforward way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quite clear what the Deputy had in mind but I am now.  He wants to get away from the present position where there has to be a plebiscite of the residents of the street and to give the right of changing the name to the members of the local <Col N="1419" /> council.  There is then the safeguard that if four-sevenths of the residents on a plebiscite object to the change, they can appeal to the Minister.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  It is probably a better situation than we have at present.  As I mentioned before, the present method is cumbersome, expensive and inefficient.  Speaking from the experience which we have had on a number of occasions in the Dublin Corporation in dealing with this matter, I would be prepared to support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion in my name and that of Deputy Finucane:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in order to relieve the acute congestion which exists in rural areas in the State, particularly in the West of Ireland, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should forthwith introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Aliens Act, 1935, so as to ensure that aliens shall not acquire land suitable for agricultural purposes or the relief of congestion unless they have at least ten years permanent residence in the State; Dáil Éireann further considers that such legislation should be retrospective to the 1st day of January, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House that the motion is tabled by two Deputies who have little knowledge of legal matters.  For some time past we have tried to devise some means by which a Private Bill could be brought before the House whereby the grievances which we feel exist could be remedied.  Because of the fact that <Col N="1420" /> there is not available to us the necessary technical and legal advice, we decided that the best method to deal with the particular problem was to put down a motion calling upon the Government to take the necessary steps.  We all know that the Government in office have at their disposal the most skilful legal advisers and that there is no danger that a Government will be ill-advised in connection with the drafting of sections or the amendment of sections.  It is in order to ensure that no hardship would devolve on those of our nation who are abroad that we call upon the Government to take those steps rather than force private Deputies to produce the concrete proposals by which we can limit aliens from purchasing in this country land that is fit for agricultural use and which could be used for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there is no mention in this motion of property other than land for agricultural purposes.  We have kept away completely from the question of industrial concerns, the purchase of property in towns and cities, for the very simple reason that we, as Deputies from rural areas, are not completely familiar with that particular aspect of the alien situation.  I say to the House that we are completely familiar with the situation that obtains in rural Ireland to-day and this motion is an appeal to those Deputies who represent rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The motion is in general terms, and calls on the Government to take certain steps.  I am quite sure that legal men in this House will be well fit to shoot down the motion in its present form but, if they succeed in doing so on technical grounds, then they are greater fools than I thought them to be in the past because the people in rural areas will see and understand that little heed will be given to their grievances and little heed will be given to the particular hardships under which they have to exist at present except when election campaigns are on.</P>
    <P>I have purposely refrained in this motion from dealing with the position of Irish people who emigrated to <Col N="1421" /> America ten, 15 or 20 years ago. I have purposely refrained in order that the Government can take steps to safeguard the position of Irish people and the descendants of Irish people who have gone to Britain, America, or the four ends of the earth, to ensure that whenever they feel like coming home to Ireland they shall not be treated as I wish to see other non-nationals treated under this motion. In other words, the question of the definition of &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; is being left to the Government draftsman so that no hardship can be done to the people of our own race who, for economic reasons, had to leave this country many years ago or to those who are leaving it to-day.</P>
    <P>The particular problem of the purchase of land by aliens has been raised by me in this House on a number of occasions.  It has also been raised by Deputies on both sides of the House.  Every time a question on the subject of the purchase of land by aliens was raised in this House an evasive answer was given.  As far as I can see, a blanket of silence has been imposed by the powers that be in connection with this very important problem.  Why that should be, I do not know.  Attempts are made by responsible Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to suggest that the problem is not as serious as some of us would lead the House to believe. Yet, the important point to remember is that no evidence has been produced by members of the Government to contradict statements made by me and other Deputies to the effect that this is a serious problem.  When they have been asked in this House time and again for figures they have failed to make available in concrete terms the actual acreage involved and the actual amount of money spent by non-nationals on the purchase of land here since the passing of the 1935 Aliens Act.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of those Deputies who are not familiar with the Aliens Act, 1935, I should explain the section with which I am concerned.  Section 3 of the 1935 Aliens Act states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Real and personal property of every description in Saorstát Éireann&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> as it was then</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;or subject to the law of Saorstát Éireann may be taken, acquired, held, and disposed of by an alien in the like manner and to the like extent as such property may be taken, acquired, held, or disposed of by a citizen of Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of that section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to qualify an alien for any office or for any municipal, parliamentary, or other franchise for which he would not be qualified if this section had not been enacted, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to qualify an alien to be the owner of a ship or of any share in a ship registered in Saorstát Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to qualify an alien to be the owner of any aircraft registered in Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Aliens Act of 1935, no alien can become a member of this House or can become the owner of a ship or an aircraft or can become part owner of a ship or an aeroplane, but any alien can purchase all the agricultural land that he likes or desires though he may not fly an areoplane above that land or be the part owner of an aeroplane which flies over that land.  But he can own all the land underneath that plane.  Now I call that section of the 1935 Act a lunatic section in a country where 75 per cent. of the holdings are under £20 valuation, in a country where 75 per cent. of the agricultural holdings have an average valuation of £7 6s., in a country where Cromwell took steps to drive the natives to Connaught or to a warmer place.  I could not see anything wrong with a section like that if it were part of an Act of Parliament in Australia or Canada or New Zealand, where they are anxious to get good farming stock, where they are anxious to have the vast tracts of undeveloped land planted by families; but to have such an Act in operation in Ireland, where we have so many agricultural slums and where so many of our people are living on economic holdings in miserable conditions <Col N="1423" /> is something which I believe the public are not aware of.</P>
    <P>In the course of my remarks on this motion I propose to give certain figures, and I challenge the Minister for External Affairs to contradict me; and if there is any suggestion, during the course of the debate which may follow, on the part of any speaker which would misrepresent the line of thought which I am developing, I will take steps in my reply to the debate, and with your permission of course, Sir, to produce a list of names of non-nationals who have purchased land here since 1941, and to give a complete history in so far as it is possible to produce it to this House.  I am sure there are many Deputies who would prefer to be elsewhere than listening to the long litany I have prepared.  I should prefer not to have to do it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is not a serious problem.  As I have said time and again when questions have been submitted to the various Ministers, they have pooh-poohed the idea that the purchase of lands by aliens was extensive.  In Volume 121, column 454 of the Official Debates there is a question in my name addressed to the Taoiseach in connection with the purchase of land by non-nationals.  On the 24th May, 1950, the present Minister for External Affairs, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, replied as follows to a supplementary question by me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave: I have no evidence which would justify the belief that the situation gives cause for any undue alarm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the 24th May, 1950.  We can forgive the then Parliamentary Secretary who is now Minister for External Affairs.  It is not his fault that he is unfamiliar with rural Ireland and with the disposal of its land. When a question of land is raised what better authority can we get than the Minister for Lands himself, then, as now, Deputy Blowick.  I raised a question in this House on the 11th May, 1950, in connection with a statement made by a land commissioner who attended at a land court in Galway. The statement made by the land commissioner <Col N="1424" /> which I quote from the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of Saturday, May 6th, 1950, is as follows.  I will not mention the name of the land commissioner:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was his opinion that the fertile lands of Meath which were not being run productively should be made available for the relief of congestion in the West.  &lsquo;It was a shame,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that 100,000 acres of the best land in the country should have recently passed into the hands of aliens&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made in Galway by a land commissioner, by one of the men appointed by the Government to deal with the problem of congestion. I raised a question in connection with that statement in this House.  I adressed it to Deputy Blowick, then Minister for Lands, and I asked him if he were in agreement with the commissioner's statement.  At column 2223, Volume 120 of the Dáil Debates Deputy Blowick replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to Deputy Cowan's and Deputy McQuillan's statements I want to say that I agree with the commissioner,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he went on to criticise the commissioner for having made such a statement, in other words, for having put Deputy Joseph Blowick into hot water by disclosing what the true situation was.  There the Minister for Lands agrees that 100,000 acres of land had passed into the hands of aliens, and five days afterwards the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach stated that the problem of the purchase of land by non-nationals was not a serious one at all.</P>
    <P>There were other questions with which I do not intend to bother the House.  The machinery that was set up by the Government in order to keep a check on the purchase of land by aliens admits my point.  Again in Volume 121, column 901 of the Official Debates the present Minister for External Affairs, in connection with the system the Government was setting up to check the purchase of land by aliens, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposed record will be incomplete in so far as it will not contain particulars of cases in which <Col N="1425" /> purchases of land by persons other than Irish citizens are exempted from payment of the 25 per cent. duty by sub-section (13) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, but it will in my judgment be adequate for the purpose in view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there was a loophole in the system they had for keeping a check on the purchase of land by aliens. Having failed by question in this House to get definite figures with regard to the purchase of land by aliens, I proceeded through various sources, through contacts I had in different counties, to compile a list of farms purchased by non-nationals in the last twelve years.  It will surprise the House when they get the figures and before I actually give those figures I want to draw a little comparison in connection with the work that has been going on by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion and compare it with the situation that exists in the relief of congestion and with the money spent by aliens on the purchase of land here and with which so many economic holdings could be set up.</P>

To compare the figures for the ten-year period ending 31st March, 1951, a total of 117,000 acres was acquired for division by the Land Commission for a total inclusive fee simple price of £1,100,000.  In 1947 the price paid for land by non-nationals reached the figure of £1,000,000 that is to say, in one year as great a sum was paid by non-nationals for land as was paid by the Land Commission for land for the relief of congestion for ten years previously.</P>

      <P>The suggestion will be made in this House that the acreage of land purchased by non-nationals is negligible.  I have pointed out that in 1947 they spent £1,000,000 here on the purchase of land.  It is misleading for Deputies to get away from the actual suggestion in this motion by pointing out that the purchases made were limited, because what counts is the actual acreage of land purchased not the actual number of purchases or sales made.  So far as specific cases are concerned many of the purchases by individuals in relation to land for agricultural purposes exceeded £50,000.  I have here Press reports of sales, published official returns, and some parliamentary replies, and they all indicate to an extent the size of this problem.  I have already pointed out that these aliens purchased land where the land is most fertile and the lists that are available show a tragic picture in counties like Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, Tipperary, Cork and Limerick.  All these purchases by aliens are made in the most fertile areas of these counties.  I have listed here on one page from the Press the names of 25 buyers with an aggregate purchase of land running to almost £500,000.  The purchase of one individual alone approached the £200,000 mark.  In one county we have a record of 50 extensive estates now in the hands of aliens and on these lists we have nobles, dukes and earls.</P>

      <P>On this list we have a various assortment of earls, dukes, adventurers, aliens under deportation orders, speculators and military gentlemen.  As a matter of fact some of them have taken steps to dignify the land they bought; one particular individual described his land as St. Patrick's estate.  I will challenge this for the Parliamentary Secretary's benefit.  It is a challenge to the Government to contradict this, that in the past 12 years almost £6,000,000 had been spent and that the area of land concerned runs from 130,000 to 150,000 acres.  That money was spent by aliens on the purchase of that land.  Look at it this way.  This figure is the equivalent, almost, in value of the County Leitrim to-day&mdash;so that while we are talking about and looking to get our Six Counties back we have allowed land amounting to the size of a county here to be purchased by non-nationals. There will be plenty of Deputies in this House to throw smoke screens out in connection with the figures I am giving but I am going to tell them that, especially in the past six years, we have been turning this country into a British bridgehead. I have mentioned these military gentlemen as purchasing land here in Ireland but, I do not want to include them completely as purchasers of the most fertile land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the London <i>Times</i> and to the correspondence <Col N="1429" /> that appears there from time to time over the names of these military gentlemen&mdash;correspondence in which retired British officers invite their comrades and invite other British officers of high rank to purchase land here in Ireland.  Very frequently, letters appear urging what I might describe as &ldquo;chappies&rdquo; to come over here and buy land.  I am not casting any reflections on them when I suggest that many of them are the makings of a good fifth column in this country if ever the occasion should arise.  I have already said they are prohibited in connection with aeroplanes and ships but there is nothing to prevent them from purchasing land in every strategic position in this country.  There is nothing to prevent them from purchasing castles, estates and land right round our coast.  There is nothing to prevent them from purchasing fertile lands in the Midlands where fences can be bulldozed and, within 24 hours, fine modern aerodromes can be made available for the landing of troops.</P>

      <P>None against the Chair.  I shall come back now to where I was.  I have pointed out that these aliens, especially the military groups, have purchased land in every strategic position in this country.  No doubt, if their services are needed, Britain will be well served in the future&mdash;if the need arises.  I should say that when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pulled me up, he brought my mind back to one very important aspect in connection with this motion.  I am mainly concerned with seeing the end of congestion in this country.  It is to ensure that whatever agricultural land, and land that is fit for the relief of congestion, is available will be kept for the Irish congest that I have deliberately put this motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather significant that when the question of congestion is being discussed here on an important motion like this, the Minister for Lands does not think it worth his while to attend and the question of the solution of congestion is going to be dealt with by two individuals who, with all due respect to them, have a very, very limited knowledge of rural Ireland.  The least we might have in this House now is the presence of the Minister for Lands so that he could give his views on this problem and tell us, in so far as it lies within his power, how many holdings <Col N="1431" /> could now be established if the land that has been purchased by aliens had been purchased, instead, by the Land Commission.  This question of the gradual reconquest or resettlement in this country by non-nationals is very important because it is still going on while, at the same time, we export between 22,000 and 25,000 young persons every year from our country.</P>
    <P>We are told by people in responsible positions that the pool of land available for the relief of congestion is very limited.  As a matter of fact, some of them go to the extent of telling us that there is no more land available for the relief of congestion, and that the congests in the nine counties in the West and South must do as they are and must continue to eke out a miserable existence in these agricultural slums.  I want to emphasise here and now that, without touching one lazy Irish rancher, 5,000 economic holdings, with an average of 30 acres, could have been established if the Land Commission had acquired this land that has been handed over to aliens. When I say 5,000 new holdings, let me draw this comparison: between 1931 and 1953 the Land Commission in all that period&mdash;a period which was looked upon as the time when the biggest drive was made for the relief of congestion&mdash;only established or created roughly 13,000 new holdings.  Admittedly, during the same period they made extensions and rearrangements in other parts of the country, but the number of new so-called economic holdings created between 1931 and 1953 was approximately 13,000.</P>
    <P>If the amount of land that has been sold to aliens in the last 12 years had been acquired we would have to-day 5,000 further new holdings of an economic nature and that would go a long way towards solving the problem of congestion in a number of counties. Let me emphasise that some of this prime land which was purchased by aliens was purchased at a lesser figure per acre than it is costing to reclaim land under the land project.  I do not know whether Deputies are prepared to believe me, especially Deputies from the city areas, when I tell them of the <Col N="1432" /> conditions under which our congests have to exist.  There seems to be an idea when the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; is mentioned here that a farmer is the type of man who has a Chrysler car and a £50 valuation.  Let me tell the House that the majority of the so-called farmers have little more than slum holdings.  The majority of them cannot live on or out of these farms. They must seek work elsewhere.  If they cannot get work at home they go abroad.  To a great extent they depend on the paypacket sent home by their sons and daughters from Britain and America to keep the homestead going.  I am not concerned here with the man with the big valuation who has plenty of bullocks.  I am concerned with the small uneconomic holder who is due a decent standard of living in his own country and a chance to rear his family.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise further the urgency of this motion to city Deputies by demonstrating what the position is in the West of Ireland, particularly in relation to Roscommon.  I will just give an example of one electoral area in which there are 408 holdings; of these, 348 are under £5 valuation. There is a small Garda barracks in that area and there is always a queue of men looking for unemployment benefit.  There is no work in the area. The sons and daughters reared in the homesteads there emigrate to England every year.  These people rear large families for export.  In case anybody thinks these figures are exaggerated the name of that locality is Kiltullagh, at the far side of Roscommon near Castlereagh.  On the opposite side of the county, near Rooskey on the Shannon, there is an estate there which has been in the hands of the Land Commission for 20 years.  There are 435 holdings and the majority of them are under £7 valuation.  For 30 years these people have been told there is hope around the corner; the Land Commission is about to consider their case.</P>
    <P>Deputies know what that means. These people are in dire need of new houses.  They cannot go ahead and build.  They would be foolish to do so because, should they build on these slum holdings, in three years' time the <Col N="1433" /> Land Commission may decide to migrate them.  Therefore, they live from day to day in hope.  While they are living in those circumstances, helping to fill our sanatoria with their offspring, the finest land in the midlands is sold into the hands of non-nationals. Does any Deputy blame me for putting down a motion of this kind when conditions such as I have described in these two areas alone exist all over the West?</P>
    <P>I am not motivated with any antagonism towards foreigners.  I am full of anxiety, however, to ensure that the claims of Irish people come first.  It is my motto that wherever there is an acre of land suitable for the relief of congestion and available for purchase by an alien, that land should be acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  I think it is a shocking position that after 30 years of native government our young people are leaving rural Ireland.  We set up commissions to inquire into the reasons why they leave.  We do not need any commission to tell us that the reason why is because they cannot live in it.</P>
    <P>While they are fleeing from parishes all over the west we have the fine fat bullock in the midlands grazing on the ranches under the benevolent eye of the alien, bringing him in wealth. I will not widen the scope of this debate as to the relative value per acre where land is producing beef, or tillage or dairying.  In this House, before the end of the debate, we will have lip service from people in relation to land policy and land resettlement. I shall hit hard at anybody who starts on lip service unless he is prepared to put his theories into practice. The people have been listening long enough to this promise that congestion will be solved.  How sincere are these politicians?  I have heard them myself. I do not want to name them here. How many politicians to-day have reaped a rich harvest out of the sale of their country to non-nationals?  I wonder could we have the figures of the amount of money handed over to prominent people here for the sale of the land of Ireland under the name of auctioneers' fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to discuss any individual.  No names will be mentioned as far as I am concerned. I am referring to the lip service paid by politicians to the problem of resettlement and to the so-called anxiety they have expressed to see that as many of the people of Ireland as possible are established on the land. While they cant along these lines on public platforms, when they go to their offices they proceed to sell the finest land in Ireland to non-nationals.</P>
      <P>A question was asked here in the Dáil on December 13th, 1950, addressed to the then Minister for Finance.  He was asked to state the amount of stamp duty received on the purchase of land by aliens.  The amount of stamp duty for a period of two and a half years, the period ending 30th June, 1950, was £181,000 approximately. If we calculate the amount of money spent by non-nationals on the purchase of land on the amount of the stamp duty, we find that they paid to the owners of land almost £750,000 for the land in these two and a half years. The stamp duty added to that brings the figure up to £900,000.  That is the amount spent by aliens in the two and a half years ending 30th June, 1950, on the purchase of land.  In the three-year period, which includes that two and a half years, the Land Commission paid £360,000 for all the land they acquired in fee simple and the owners of the land received approximately £260,000 out of that, so that we have the fact that in two and a half years non-nationals spent £900,000 on the purchase of laid here while the Land Commission spent £360,000 in acquiring land to relieve congestion in three years, including that two and half year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only by getting figures from various Departments that we can get any idea of what is happening so far as the purchase of land by aliens is concerned.  The situation became so bad on the British Labour Government coming into office, that the Government here was forced by pressure of public opinion to increase the stamp <Col N="1435" /> duty.  In 1947 the stamp duty went up to 25 per cent.  I am not an expert in finance but I gather that the devaluation of the £ would to a great extent counteract the increase in the stamp duty.  At any rate, so far as I am personally concerned, this 25 per cent. stamp duty was anything but sufficient to discourage these people from coming in.  It has not proved successful. In this motion we call on the Government specifically to deal with the problem of agricultural land, that is suitable for the relief of congestion. We are not asking the Government to deal with property in any other sense, either industrial concerns or other property owned by companies.  The motion is directed solely towards the question of land suitable for agricultural purposes and for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The latter part of the motion states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann further considers that such legislation should be retrospective to the 1st day of January, 1945.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a matter on which I should like to hear the views of other Deputies before we come to any final decision. The main thing we want to establish is that it should go out from this House that the land of Ireland is for the people of Ireland, that we have no animosity towards foreigners as such in this House or in the country, but that this being a small country which has not yet solved its land problem, we do not feel ourselves in a position to allow land here in Ireland to be purchased or acquired by people of a different race.  It may be, as I have already said, all right for Australia, Canada and New Zealand to welcome incoming farming stock in order to build up and develop these countries but is it not a tragic situation that we are pouring out of this country the finest farming stock year after year when we could help to fix up so many of them on economic holdings here at home?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to accept the motion and, if they are not prepared to accept it in its present <Col N="1436" /> form, that at any rate they would indicate to the House that they are prepared to take the steps necessary to ensure that the land of this country will be reserved for Irishmen and that they will get first preference.  Not being legal-minded, and having no technical advice at our disposal, we put down this motion as ordinary lay Deputies in the hope that we would have the sympathy of the majority of Deputies from rural Ireland on our side.  When you know in your hearts what is right and what should be done, I think it would be a tragic position to see our efforts defeated on the grounds that we have failed to meet the necessary requirements in regard to legal drafting and so forth.  As I said, we do not hold ourselves out to be experts on these matters and it is on that basis that we expect the Government to treat the motion in the spirit in which it has been moved by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  My reason for doing so is that I am of opinion that all the land now left in this country is needed for the relief of congestion and for the settlement of the land problem by migration and otherwise.  We all know that after the last war a rush was made by foreigners to purchase lands in Éire because they regarded it as a sound investment.  They benefited from the rights conferred by the three F's in the same way as any national but the yearly income from the lands they purchased is not spent for the benefit of this country.  I am supporting this motion because I believe it is an honest one and that some day some Government must face this problem. The time is, I believe, now opportune to tackle the problem before it is too late.  For the last 12 years, I have put a number of questions in this House in regard to land division in Kerry but in that period of 12 years not one farthing has been spent on the acquisition of land in that county.  I had been asked to put down these questions by the people themselves who wish to have their land acquired by the Land Commission in order that they might be transferred to counties like Meath, Kildare or Dublin.  Not <Col N="1437" /> one farthing has been paid for such land in that period of 12 years.  I have another instance in which within the past three years the Land Commission proposed to acquire a certain farm but six months ago the Land Commission indicated that they were not now prepared to take that farm.</P>
      <P>I believe this is an honest motion and I would ask the Government to accept it in the form as put down.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride has made one of the points which I intended to make in the course of my remarks.  Those of us who come from areas where there is congestion and a great many small-holdings must naturally be interested in this motion. All of us indeed will support any move that will tend towards the relief of congestion but I just wonder how far the purchase of land by foreigners is preventing the solution of the problem of congestion in the congested areas. I would like to ascertain, and I hope to put down a question for the next meeting of the Dáil, to what extent land has been purchased in this country by foreigners.  I think the Minister will find the information readily available from the figures relating to the numbers of people who have paid the high percentage stamp duty <Col N="1438" /> on purchases.  Those figures must certainly be available and by that means we will be able to ascertain whether or not there is any great infiltration by foreign purchasers.  In addition, I would be interested to know to which areas of the country they are coming in the greater numbers, which area is most affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not mind my interrupting, I think the stamp duty will not necessarily reveal the true position because in many cases the land is bought by companies which were formed prior to 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a means of circumventing the stamp duty and it is not a legal way.  Those of us who are auctioneers have certain knowledge with regard to this particular problem.  My own experience is that seldom, if ever, do foreigners buy land in congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  They do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they do, I am afraid our experience is that they usually buy a holding at an inflated price, stay in it for a year or two, spend all the money they have in trying to make a success of it and then sell it at a loss and get out.  I am afraid that is exactly what our experience is with regard to small-holdings in congested areas.  The same may not be true of foreigners purchasing land in the better parts of Ireland where the land is good and where they may be able to make a success of it.  We have too often seen them coming along and trying to teach us their way and they find in the long run they are not able to make a success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that is every congested area in Ireland at the moment, every townland you go into, you will find from three to five farms of land for sale for which no purchaser can be found.  If that position is to be remedied and if any Government is to tackle the problem seriously they will make an arrangement whereby the Land Commission will take over that holding and add it to the neighbouring holding to make it a larger and more <Col N="1439" /> economic holding.  In my opinion, that is the one solution to this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>In fact, I would be in agreement with an arrangement whereby no person would be allowed to buy land in what would be termed a congested area; that the Land Commission in all cases should step in and take the holding and have it allocated to the contiguous holdings in order to make them more economic, and in that way give a chance to those who are compelled to remain in those holdings.</P>
    <P>Too often we find when trying to get a purchaser for a farm in a congested area or mountainous district that the people whom one would expect to be interested in purchasing the holding are themselves prepared to sell, if they could get a reasonable price, and get out.  While that position remains it is difficult to see why it should be necessary to put a further embargo on foreigners coming in, by way of increased stamp duty or otherwise, to prevent them buying holdings which are lying derelict in hundreds with nobody attempting to buy them.  It is clearly a position where the Land Commission must come in and make some definite arrangement whereby these holdings would be taken over at an economic price from those who are prepared to sell them and who want to get out and given to the adjoining holdings or to those who are prepared to take them and work them successfully.</P>
    <P>I would not say that in all cases it would be suitable to have them allocated to the people in the adjoining holdings because very often they are not terribly interested in the holding they have or very often they are people who themselves are prepared to sell out if they could find a suitable purchaser. They should be given to some person who is prepared to work them and to make a success of the holding generally.</P>
    <P>That, in my opinion, is the solution that will meet the general requirements of this motion.  Any more towards that end will find the support, I am sure, of every Deputy representing a congested area.</P>
    <P>I had occasion more than once to <Col N="1440" /> make out a list of derelict holdings which were on the market and for which no purchaser could be found and to submit them to the Land Commission asking them to acquire them and have them allocated to the people in the adjoining holdings or to some person in the same townland who had an uneconomic holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A different problem may exist in the better areas but, certainly, if you are going to put restrictions on the number of people who will be able to purchase holdings it should be the duty of the Land Commission to make alternative arrangements to ensure that these people find some means of disposing of their holdings when they want to and at the same time give an opportunity to increase the smaller holdings in the same area.</P>
      <P>That is my attitude towards this matter.  I am speaking entirely from the professional experience and from my own experience and I would say that it is not my experience that foreigners have created any serious problems in the congested areas by buying up holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It at least explains the matter so far as I am concerned that the point behind this motion is that all the lands which may be available for the relief of congestion would be left in the hands of the nationals so that they may be divided in order to relieve congestion.  If that is the point, it is a reasonable and good point.  It is certainly not the point I have read into the motion.  The motion, so far as I see it, refers to the relief of congestion and then asks for a further embargo to be put on non-nationals purchasing land in this country to prevent them purchasing land which should ordinarily be left for nationals. If it is intended that it should apply to the large estates sometimes purchased, I am sure, by foreigners, so that these estates may be available for distribution for the relief of congestion in the congested areas, then it is a very good point indeed.  At the same time, it will have to be followed up by a definite arrangement on the part of the Land Commission to take over these derelict holdings and have them allocated among the people in the areas in which they are lying derelict at the moment, without any purchaser taking any interest in them.  We have far too many of these holdings and every Deputy coming from a congested area can bring to mind several cases in every townland in his constituency&mdash;instances of holdings lying derelict with nobody taking any interest in them at the moment, but which are available for anybody who will offer any sort of reasonable price, so that the owners may get rid of them.  In many cases, the owners have long since emigrated. Some are in America and some in England and other parts of the world.  A number are still occupied by people who are anxious to dispose of them, and if the Land Commission will make an arrangement whereby they will take these over, I would strongly support any move in that direction.</P>

It raises it in regard to the question of land, which, of course, is probably the most serious aspect of any large-scale influx of foreign capital.  I think the Deputy bringing this motion forward has done well to do so at this time, because there is undoubtedly very considerable uneasiness at the apparent vast influx of foreign capital, in land in particular, in the course of the past few years.  It is a matter that would cause a considerable amount of uneasiness in any country.  It is always regarded as a dangerous sign and one that should be checked.  In addition to agricultural land, there has been a good deal of evidence of the influx of alien capital in land values as well in the City of Dublin and indeed in many business spheres.  Particularly in recent times, we have seen reports in the papers of old established big business firms changing hands.  That undoubtedly is a matter which does not arise on this motion, but I think it deserves a good deal of attention.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with this question, as Deputy McQuillan has pointed out, is the apparent difficulty that exists in obtaining accurate information, and Deputy McQuillan is quite justified in saying that there has been some form of reluctance on the part of the Departments responsible&mdash;I am not blaming the Ministers but more the Departments themselves&mdash;in making this information available.  One always has the feeling that it is a question of using a corkscrew to get information of that nature from the Department of Finance.  They are always very touchy on this question, but that is a completely mistaken policy on the part of the Department of Finance because it only increases the uneasiness that exists.  I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will use their best endeavours between now and whatever date the discussion on the motion is resumed to ensure that the fullest information possible is made available to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the figures which Deputy McQuillan has relied on are very alarming and it is a matter in respect <Col N="1443" /> of which the House is entitled to have very full information.  Another matter upon which information would be useful is the type of legislation that exists in other countries to avoid just this very evil.  The influx of foreign capital, particularly in land, is always, as I have pointed out, regarded as a dangerous sign and I think that most countries at some time or another have had to legislate in order to protect themselves from it.  I am subject to correction, but I think that in many European countries you will find that there is legislation which forbids the acquisition of land by a non-national to the extent of more than, say, five or ten acres, more than an area sufficient to enable a farmer who wishes to build a house and come to live here to do so.</P>
    <P>It would be useful in considering this motion if the Minister could possibly obtain particulars of the type of legislation which exists in other countries in regard to that.  I think that in European countries there is generally some type of legislation to restrict the acquisition of land by non-nationals.  Whether it is a complete prohibition or a limited one which operates under licence, I am not quite certain.  It would also be useful to have an indication of the maximum quantity of land which a non-national is permitted to buy in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in what Deputy Brennan said.  I feel that farmers do not wish to come to acquire land in a congested area, or those who do are usually more the better type of non-national who comes over and acquires a place as a holiday resort or something of that kind.  The non-nationals who, I think, are the most harmful are those who come and acquire vast tracts of our best land to use it as a source of income for themselves, either by using it as a ranch or by working it themselves.  The whole question is so closely woven into the major economic problem of the country that it is very hard to discuss it just by itself.  Our whole economic problem is based on our non-utilisation of our land, labour and capital.  I probably wearied the House on other occasions by pointing out the mad economy which we have <Col N="1444" /> accepted so readily for a long time here whereby we export capital that could be utilised here in the development of the land.  As a result of the export of the capital that should be utilised to develop our land we ultimately export our people.  Land is one of the three essential ingredients for the creation of wealth.  It is obvious therefore, that any large influx of foreign capital in land is bound to have a prejudicial effect on the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>That aspect is considerably worsened when one appreciates the degree of congestion that exists throughout the whole of rural Ireland.  Deputy McQuillan referred to rural slums in Donegal, Leitrim and in the West generally.  He is quite right.  Both holdings of £5 and £10 valuation are completely uneconomic.  I would nearly wish that there was some prospect of being able to deal with the position by stopping the acquisition of land by aliens.  I am afraid that would probably not deal with it but it might be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, it forms part of this whole problem&mdash;it seems to have become rather acute in recent times&mdash;of the influx of foreign capital. I have no objection to foreign capital coming in when it is for industrial development and when it is accompanied by technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; or knowledge, particularly if the influx of foreign capital for industrial development is primarily intended to secure the development of the export industry.  But in the case of the acquisition of land there is no question of the alien coming here and bringing with him technical knowledge.  There is no question of his enabling land to be used which would not otherwise be used.  If the land was left in the hands of nationals or taken over by the Land Commission or even by the Forestry Department it would be used.  It certainly would not remain unused.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try and obtain for the House as much information as he can.  Possibly he will have difficulty in worming it out of the Department of Finance who never like to reveal these figures which they must have.  Even if they are not accurate <Col N="1445" /> figures, at least they give a reasonable approximation of the area of land at present in the hands of non-nationals in the country.</P>
    <P>The motion itself is not ideally worded but I think it should not be approached from any narrow viewpoint. It should not be approached on the basis that there are certain portions of the motion which are not approved of by everybody.  I think the intention behind the motion is what should be considered.  I am quite certain, if there was any inclination on the part of the House to adopt the motion, that by agreement the wording could be so altered as to get over any technical draw-backs there might be in it.  Therefore, I would ask the House to approach the motion not so much from a narrow legalistic point of view as from the intention behind it of enabling us to ensure that land will not be sold to aliens while there is congestion.</P>
    <P>Probably the best way of dealing with the position would be to limit the area of land which a non-national could purchase to whatever area may be necessary to provide facilities for the non-national who may wish to come here and build a house in which to live himself.  Let it be five acres or even ten acres if you like.  I would not suggest that we should even be niggardly on that but certainly it should be limited to an area which might reasonably be required for the building of a private dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>Apart from the land which is acquired for agricultural purposes, there is also the problem of the land speculator, the non-national who comes here.  That has been quite an acute problem in recent years in and about the City of Dublin.  Non-nationals have come here and bought areas of land for speculation.  Some bought the land just because they had the capital and they re-sold it.  Some bought the land, did a certain amount of development and then re-sold it.  I think that has been done on quite an extensive scale.  In a number of cases I think they have also evaded the payment of any stamp duty by utilising a company which was formed prior to <Col N="1446" /> 1947.  As a matter of fact, quite a brisk trade has been done in the sale of &ldquo;dead&rdquo; companies formed prior to 1947.  These companies were bought by non-nationals.  As the companies were registered here prior to 1947 these people could then purchase the land and avoid paying stamp duty.  It was a form of tax evasion if you like but something which was within the law. It had been practised extensively.  The Minister might also try to obtain some information from the Department of Finance as to their view of the extensiveness of that type of land purchase in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If I interpret the motion correctly or the idea behind it it is a reflection of the feeling in the minds of Deputies from the congested districts of the utter failure of the Land Commission to deal with the land slum problem.  In so far as the intention behind the motion is such as is stated, there are a few matters I should like to deal with.</P>
      <P>If the relief of the land slum problem is the main thing in the minds of the movers of this motion I am very much afraid that even if the motion were passed and the Aliens Act repealed it would have little or no effect upon what the movers of the motion are trying to get after.  It is quite apparent now to everybody that although technically the Land Commission have powers to come into the open market and purchase land, they have not been doing it.  Their machinery is such that these powers are useless as far as the solution of the land slum problems are concerned.  They have been making absolutely no headway with that machinery largely, I think, either because of the lack of discretion on the part of local Land Commission officials to purchase land as it becomes available on the market without referring to Dublin or to some cumbersome machinery of the Land Commission so that their hands are tied.  I move the adjournment of the Debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctantly compelled to raise the question of the North County Dublin regional water scheme on the Adjournment to-night. This is a matter I have been deeply concerned about since I went into public life.  In 1944, when I came into <Col N="1448" /> this House, I was told that the North County Dublin regional water scheme would service all the towns Coolock, Malahide, Swords, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Skerries and Balbriggan.  Deputy Seán MacEntee, then Minister for Local Government, did his best and suggested the formation of a co-ordinating committee at that time and he was very anxious that this work should be done.  That was followed up by his successor and again I had questions down to the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Keyes, who gave me the same answer, that the scheme was still having attention.  At this time it was very much shortened and I was told it would go only as far as Swords and Malahide.</P>
      <P>Again, I had questions down when Deputy Smith was Minister for Local Government.  He was interested in trying to get water for North County Dublin also and he gave the scheme his support.  The present questions are further ones in this matter.  I want to take this completely out of the field of ordinary Party politics, as it is a national matter as far as we are concerned in County Dublin.  I do not want to put the present Parliamentary Secretary &ldquo;on the spot,&rdquo; but Dublin is concerned for ten years with a very serious situation in getting water for the people I am representing.  We had the usual parry across the floor of the House here on this question and it was asked why did Dublin County Council not carry out a scheme on its own. That is an utter impossibility.  We, in County Dublin, are situate around Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When there was first talk about the scheme, an inquiry was held in 1937 and it was presided over by Mr. Gavan Duffy.  He recommended that a water board be set up to deal with the water position for Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and the adjoining councils, including Dún Laoghaire Borough, I suppose.  In 1938 we were to get 2,000,000 gallons of water from the Dublin Corporation.  First the Poulaphouca scheme came along and we were to get the water, then the Liffey scheme came and we were to get the water&mdash;but I see all the promises made by the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1449" /> and notwithstanding that they are continuing to fail to fulfil those promises.  In 1952 the corporation told the county council that they would give at least 1,500,000 a day.  That would facilitate them in the built-up areas just adjoining the city&mdash;Coolock, Santry, Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Portmarnock and Malahide.  They gave a guarantee in 1952, when they acquired the land, that they would be able to supply 43,000 people with water.  You can see, a Cheann Comhairle, by the trend of my argument, how much they have shortened their promises of 1938, 1944 and since.  The last reply they sent to the county council was that they could not give any more water.</P>
    <P>We want a housing scheme started very badly in Blanchardstown.  Our council has submitted a scheme and tenders to the Minister for sanction for the building of these houses and yet the corporation cannot give any more water.  You might say they have enough to do to look after themselves, but due to our geographical position I do not see any other way.  I have given this matter serious consideration and every other Deputy in the House, no matter to what Party he belongs, who is representing Dublin County, knows that this water question is a national problem, the same as housing. Each one of us receives letters from people who have to drink water that comes out of old wells along the road within a few miles of Dublin.  We have housing schemes in the county without any water.  The council is trying to sink pumps and in certain areas, even in Deputy Rooney's parish, where 12 houses were built, there is a pump sunk and now there are about 45 children there who have no water and cannot get it there.  Dublin County Council is not to blame for this position.  It has become very serious and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary here to-night to use his influence with the Dublin Corporation to try to get a water board set up.  If we had one and if it was as active as it could be, we would achieve what we want to achieve for our people.</P>
    <P>Due to the proximity of the city to the county, the city gradually is taking <Col N="1450" /> over the county.  The only way I can see this work done economically is by following up the suggestion made by Mr. Gavan Duffy at that inquiry in 1937, that a water board be set up. Deputy MacEntee was very keen when he was Minister to have a co-ordinating committee&mdash;call it what you like.  It is very hard luck on us, within a few miles of Dublin, that a housing scheme cannot go ahead because we cannot get water.  I have tried to look at this from the layman's point of view, as to how we could get a proper water supply economically.  The only way I can see, as the city is in the centre of our constituency, is to have a water board set up, as otherwise the rates would be colossal.</P>
    <P>I am not going to ask for any favours.  We do not want to get away with anything cheap.  We are anxious to pay our proper ratio for our requirements, as far as paying for the water is concerned, and we would do that by every means in our power.</P>
    <P>It is a rather sad reflection that Portmarnock, within a few miles of Dublin, where thousands of people from the city go to enjoy themselves in the summer time, has not a piped water supply.  It is sad to see that in Malahide, when the weather gets any way warm at all, there are complaints about the condition of the water supply that the Dublin County Council tried to put there.  In Donabate, where thousands of extra visitors go during the summer time, there is nothing but septic tanks.  In Skerries, in August, 1953, during the height of the tourist season, where you have a big holiday camp and where every house was occupied by some visitors from the City of Dublin or some other area around Dublin, notices were put up that the water would be cut off at 7 o'clock in the evening.  The Dublin County Council have been lulled into a false security because they were told this North County Dublin regional water supply would cure all their ills.  In Balbriggan, in 1953, the position was that the people could not drink the water unless it was boiled.</P>
    <P>I have spoken many times on the Vote for the Department of Local <Col N="1451" /> Government on this question of the necessity of having clean drinking water.  This is a serious problem and I want to take it out of the political sphere altogether.  People might say that if my own Minister were there I would not bring this matter up now.  I can assure you I would.  I have declared war on the bad water system in County Dublin and I will use any methods at my disposal to bring about better conditions in the constituency I have the honour to represent.</P>

      <P>I am fighting against the system that is responsible for having the people in my constituency drinking water out of old drains.  I advocate that a water board should be set up to deal with this problem and let us not be ten years more before we can get some water for the people.  There are factories around Santry which have very little water; they have a certain supply from Dublin. Every effort we made to build houses entailed a row with the Dublin Corporation. I am not saying anything about the Dublin Corporation because they have their own responsibilities. What I am asking is that a special committee be set up to co-ordinate the water supplies at our disposal in city and county.  If we have not enough water we should at least have enough consulting engineers to see that there is a further supply.  Whatever water we get from the Dublin area we will pay for <i>pro rata</i> as the people of Dublin have to pay for it.  There are other members of the Dublin County Council here to whom I would like to give an opportunity of speaking.  There is the ex-chairman of the Dublin County Council who has experience of this over many years.  He knows what I have been saying here is true.  I understand that the consulting engineers appointed in Dublin County to deal with this water position in Skerries and Balbriggan are still looking into the matter.  This is only a piecemeal effort; directly we have a hot summer or any dry weather we will be up against this position again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to perform miracles.  His predecessors have done their best and I have no reason to doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will do likewise.  I would ask him to use any machinery at his disposal to provide a good supply of clean water.  The principal point with which I am deeply concerned is to have a co-ordinating committee or a water board set up so that people adjacent to the City of Dublin who go out to enjoy themselves in the suburbs along by the north coast will not be inconvenienced by this shortage of drinking water.  As I said, we have been lulled into a false security in the Dublin County Council by the promise of this North County Dublin regional scheme.  First it was to solve all our problems and now when it has been tried out we are not going to get any supply from it at all.  Even a housing scheme in Blanchardstown is held up on this account.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Burke in what he has said here.  I want to refer the Parliamentary Secretary to some of the assurances given to the Dublin County Council by the Dublin Corporation.  The first one was before the Greater Dublin Tribunal when the officials of the corporation promised that they would meet the needs of the Dublin County Council in full when the Liffey supply scheme came into operation.  Similar assurances were given by the city corporation officials at the public inquiry into the corporation's loan under the proposals for the Liffey scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find this guarantee in the records of those public inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present north regional scheme was negotiated during the years 1945 to 1947 and at the final stage the negotiations were presided over by an inspector from the Parliamentary Secretary's Department.  The city officials agreed to give the county council 2,000,000 gallons per day for the county area and on this basis the consultant in the county council designed his scheme.  In preparing the scheme the consultant <Col N="1453" /> had the full concurrence of the city engineer who had to approve of it before the Minister gave his sanction to the final plan.  When finally the Dublin Corporation extended its boundary in 1953 it was agreed that the county council would be allotted 250,000 gallons per day.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find this guarantee in the evidence given to his inspector who inquired into the boundary extension.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go into these matters and when he has done so he will find that he has power under the Liffey Act of 1936 to make an Order directing that County Dublin gets its fair share of water at a fair price.  He might consider going further and acting on the advice of the Greater Dublin Tribunal to set up a water board for the Dublin area so that fair and equitable treatment will be given to all Dublin citizens irrespective of which side of any boundary they may happen to live.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to state that this water problem is not solely a North County Dublin problem.  It is also a South County Dublin problem and includes the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>I only want five minutes.  The subject of this question which has been raised on the Adjournment is exactly the same as the subject of Question No. 36 which I had on the Order Paper the same day.  It is a sad day when the representatives of Dublin County Council have to come in here and the elected Deputies for the county to ask the Minister for Local Government to see that justice is done between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  The position is that some 20 years ago, when the housing development of Dublin City and County was planned in a general way, the question of providing a water supply arose for the houses to be provided throughout Dublin County, apart from Dublin City.  It was agreed by Dublin Corporation at that time, particularly <Col N="1454" /> under the Liffey Act of 1936, to provide the full requirements of water to Dublin County under the heading of the North Dublin regional water supply.  Dublin County Council, in good faith, undertook the framework of a general plan for the supply of water for North County Dublin.  They appointed a consultant and proceeded with providing the framework of this water supply scheme, which has involved Dublin County Council in an expenditure of between £300,000 and £400,000.  Now, having spent almost £400,000 getting ready for this North Dublin regional water supply scheme, they are told they will not get 2,000,000 gallons of water per day nor the 1,250,000 gallons, which were later promised, but that they will get no water at all.</P>
      <P>In addition to that £400,000 which Dublin County Council spent on preparing to take this supply of water through its system in the various districts and towns of the north county, a further £43,000 was expended by Dublin County Council in anticipation of a water supply for Blanchardstown and Castleknock.  That water supply was required because, as a result of a public inquiry, it was found that at least 100 services cottages were required in the Blanchardstown area. The plans have been sanctioned and the tender accepted for the building of nearly 60 houses at Blanchardstown and there, in the Minister's own office, that tender is awaiting his sanction. He cannot sanction that tender until he is sure water will be connected to these cottages.  That is the position we find at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a report so ably compiled by the officers of Dublin County Council, we have clear evidence of solemn undertakings given on different occasions at conferences between Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation that a proper and sufficient water supply would be provided. Dublin County was satisfied to take 1,250,000 gallons of water per day from Dublin Corporation by these arrangements. When Dublin Corporation wanted to take, and did take, nearly 7,000 acres of land from Dublin County Council, once more the question of <Col N="1455" /> providing a water supply arose and, even at that time, we were assured that the North Dublin regional water supply scheme would be provided with the 1,250,000 gallons.  In fact, on one occasion, when a public inquiry took place in 1947, the Minister himself got an assurance from the officials of Dublin Corporation that they were asking for a loan to go ahead with the Liffey scheme and that sufficient water would be provided even as far north as Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk and Rush.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputies Burke, Dockrell and Rooney will not misunderstand me and my attitude if I must necessarily be very brief in my reply.  I do not want to say anything now that would prejudice the possibility of an amicable settlement of this very old and troublesome dispute by the parties that should attempt to arrive at a speedy solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke has now put forward the novel suggestion that we should establish a water board.  I am sure he will agree with me that that would not provide a ready answer to the problem.  The time taken to get such a board into active operation and the time taken by any such board that might be set up to discuss the whole problem would mean further and perhaps unnecessary delay.  The Deputy and the other Deputies who have spoken in the debate must be well aware that the water to be provided under the terms of the alleged <Col N="1456" /> undertakings or agreement will be drawn from the Poulaphouca reservoir through means already provided by Dublin Corporation for the supplying of the city and certain other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the assertions made by Deputies Burke, Dockrell and Rooney regarding undertakings given by the Dublin Corporation in 1938, 1947 or 1953.  It is possible, however, that whoever gave the undertakings, say in 1947, could not have then foreseen the housing development that would take place inside either the city boundary as we knew it at the time or the extended area as it is now known to everyone.  Over 10,000 houses have been erected by the Dublin Corporation since 1947 and allowance must be made for the claims of the people now living in these houses on the corporation's water supply.  However, I am satisfied there is very clear evidence in a document I read dated 12th February, 1952, that undertakings were given at a conference held on that particular date.</P>
    <P>It is the wish of the Minister and it is my wish&mdash;in fact, I have a very keen desire that the people who are waiting for these facilities should be provided with them without any further unreasonable delay.  The city manager is the city and county manager.  In addition to his responsibility for the supervision of the administration of the affairs of the City of Dublin, he has overriding authority, as city and county manager, concerning all matters of this kind so far as Dublin County is concerned.  The job of city manager is a big job.  I venture to say that Deputies will agree that the man who occupies the post is a big man.  It is the desire of the Minister, it is my desire and it is the desire of the officials of the Department that the city manager&mdash;who is the city and county manager&mdash;should take this matter in hand himself without any further delay.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be surprised to learn that there is no reliable up-to-date data in the Department of Local Government on this matter from either one side or the other.  It is desirable that agreed data should be supplied to the <Col N="1457" /> Department by the county council and the city manager if the Department is to intervene usefully in this matter.  I give an assurance to the Deputies, in the short time at my disposal, that I will ask the city manager, who is the city and county manager, to take this matter in hand without further delay in the knowledge that he will get every encouragement and assistance from <Col N="1458" /> the Minister and the chief officers of the Department of Local Government in finding a very early solution.</P>
