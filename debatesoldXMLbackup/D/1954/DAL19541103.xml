      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the weather conditions which have brought about a severe shortage of fuel and the complete loss of the turf crop in many areas, he will request Bord na Móna to have a scheme prepared to alleviate the extreme hardships caused by these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that, while they have been subject to the same weather conditions as those which affected other turf producers, they have available at their <Col N="254" /> principal works throughout the country limited quantities of machine won turf for sale.  I have no reason to doubt that adequate supplies of alternative fuels are at present available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider, from the information which is available to him, that adequate supplies of Bord na Móna turf are within the reach of persons living in the poorer parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that they have supplies of turf within a reasonable transport distance of counties such as Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. However, many of the people in these two counties are not in a position to pay cash for supplies of Bord na Móna turf.  As we all know, the weather conditions have caused a severe shortage of fuel and, in many areas, even the complete loss of the turf crop. What is to become of people who have no resources wherewith to buy their fuel requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is raising the question of assisting such people because of their difficulties in relation to providing fuel supplies for themselves, that does not seem to be a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce but one, rather, either for the local authority or some other Department&mdash;certainly not the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the adjustment which has been made in the flour subsidy to millers consequent on the increase in the price of mill offals, and the expected total saving to the Exchequer in the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The original draft estimates for flour and wheatenmeal subsidy for the financial year 1954-55 were prepared on the assumption that millers would receive on average during that financial year, £25 per ton for offals, i.e., the price then prevailing. Towards the end of 1953, however, world prices of wheaten offals fell by about £5 a ton and prices of home-produced offals fell correspondingly.  This involved a reduction of some £37,500 a month in the estimated receipts by millers from sales of offals and provision for a corresponding increase in payments from the Exchequer was accordingly made in the final estimate for flour and wheatenmeal subsidy for 1954-55.</P>
      <P>In recent months the world price of offals moved upwards and since then the receipts of the millers from sales of offals have averaged £23 a ton.  This increase in price has the effect of reducing to £15,000 a month the losses to be met by the Exchequer arising from the earlier fall in offal prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether the Flour Millers' Association informed him of their intention to increase the price of wheat offals before doing so; and, if so, if he communicated to them any view on the desirability or otherwise of so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Flour millers sell the offals they produce at the best price obtainable, and the price obtainable is determined by the price at which offals can be imported from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Flour Millers' Association did not give me advance advice of their intention to raise offal prices, and I did not communicate any view on the subject to the association.  Like the flour millers, I must accept the fact <Col N="256" /> that, as we are dependent on imports for about 45 per cent. of our requirements of wheaten offals, the price of offals on the Irish market will move up or down in sympathy with prices on the world markets.</P>

      <P>There is no information available in my Department as to the tonnage discharged at various ports by individual ship owners nor of the ultimate destinations of cargoes unloaded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will grant the Wexford Engineering Company, which is operating without any protection either by way of tariff or quota restriction, an import licence for certain steel requirements immediately necessary for the continuance of production by that firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No licence is required for the importation of steel.  Imports of certain types of steel are, however, subject to duty.</P>
      <P>In view of the temporary cessation of production by Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, some months ago, it was decided that duty-free import facilities on a restricted basis would be granted to firms utilising steel of the type normally produced by that company. The Wexford Engineering Company have already received the duty-free import facilities to which they were entitled under this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Wexford Engineering Company were refused these facilities by the Minister's Department and on applying to Irish Steel Holdings they were informed that they could not get their necessary requirements there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all firms who sought to import steel on the duty-free basis were treated equitably and there was no special decision for one firm as distinct from another.  They were all treated alike so far as the facilities available were concerned.  The difficulty arose, as I mentioned, out of the fact that Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, had to cease production on general lines for the purpose of installing a new furnace. That furnace has now been installed and Irish Steel Holdings will this week be proceeding to produce steel flats again and in three or four weeks' time it is likely they will be producing steel angles again which should meet the requirements of this and other Irish firms concerned.  If there are any special difficulties in this matter and if the Deputy will communicate with me I will have it specially examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's second reply but I have already communicated with the Department of Industry and Commerce and I have a letter from that Department in which these importations are refused.  Further representations have been made to me by this firm that they cannot get this product from Irish Steel Holdings, Limited.  This matter has been under consideration now for over a month and I have not got any definite decision except this one refusing importation on the 27th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is seeking in his representations is to get for this firm facilities which have not been extended to any other firm.  I thought I made it clear that all these firms were treated on the same basis. The Deputy's representations, which I can quite understand, are designed to secure some special facilities for this firm.  They obviously cannot get facilities which are not made available to other firms.  However, it is not possible in the course of a question and answer to explain the rather complicated mechanism which had to be devised when duty-free licences were being issued.  The main object of the arrangement which was come to was to make sure that people did not unfairly exploit the fact that Irish Steel Holdings were closed for a certain period for the installation of a new furnace.  We had to make sure that those who had been given those facilities did not stock up with imported steel at the expense of Irish Steel Holdings when they would resume production.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the number of merchandise licensed lorries in East Cork is completely inadequate to cater for the needs of the agricultural and business communities in the area; and, if so, whether he will grant additional licences to lorry owners in the area.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, C.I.E. are charged with the duty of providing <Col N="261" /> the necessary transport facilities to meet the needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry.  I am informed by the board that they have not received any complaints regarding failure to provide transport in the East Cork area.  I am satisfied that C.I.E. and existing licensed hauliers are in a position to meet the transport needs of the area and in the circumstances I would be precluded under the terms of the Transport Act, 1944, from granting additional merchandise licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the last ten years the transport in that area during the harvest season has been carried out mainly by lorries without a merchandise licence plate?  During the particular harvest season C.I.E's. only way of meeting the transport situation was to hire those unplated lorries and charge 7½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising the question as to the adequacy of the transport facilities available in the area.  My inquiries indicate that there is a total of 35 licensed hauliers with addresses in Cork City: that in East Cork area there is a total of 20 licensed hauliers and that, in addition, C.I.E. have 25 vehicles available for transport at the Cork depot and that that number of vehicles can be supplemented if the necessity arises.  There does not, therefore, seem to be any special deficiency in the East Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience during the past month, and particularly during the past fortnight, is that, owing to certain circumstances, the farmers found it impossible to get plated lorries from anybody to take their harvest to the market.  Up to this year the unplated lorries were allowed to take it but due to the activities of the Department of Justice recently they are not now permitted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Deputy's difficulties may relate to the special problem surrounding the harvest and delivery to the mills of this year's wheat crop.  I do not think we should, <Col N="262" /> for a temporary emergency of that kind, contemplate the issue of licences on a permanent basis, which is what I think the Deputy is suggesting. Perhaps, the temporary difficulties can be met in a way other than that suggested in the question.</P>

A proportion of unmillable wheat has already been purchased by millers and others, and every effort is being made to ensure that drying facilities will be made available to farmers to have such wheat dried without delay in order that it may be conditioned for animal feeding.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider fixing for wheat, irrespective of moisture or bushel weight, a minimum price which would, at least, safeguard badly-hit farmers against the total loss of the season's crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices for millable wheat of this year's crop were fixed under the Wheat Order, 1954, made by me on the 23rd July last.  The deductions to be made in respect of excess moisture content, as specified in that Order, were modified in favour of the growers by an Amending Order made by me on the 7th October.  Farmers who have millable wheat to sell have, therefore, a guaranteed minimum price.  It would not be practicable to fix a minimum price for unmillable wheat, having regard to the wide variation in the quality of such wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a distinct difference between wheat of millable quality and unmillable wheat. Unmillable wheat is the subject of individual agreements between purchasers and vendors.  In respect of millable wheat the farmer is entitled to the guaranteed minimum price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the very high percentage of unmillable wheat and the prospect of much of this wheat rotting, he will set up an organisation which would deal with the problem and which would consider the possibility of part of the milling industry's equipment being used for the purpose of turning the unfit wheat into animal fodder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to set up an organisation on the lines suggested.  The drying facilities of the milling industry are at present being operated with the main object of saving potentially millable wheat.  Up to the present, where circumstances permitted, quantities of unmillable wheat have been accepted by the millers, and, so far as my Department is concerned, every effort is being made to ensure that such drying facilities as it may be possible to divert for the drying of unmillable wheat will be available to farmers to have such wheat dried for disposal as animal feed.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative, and as to the second part I take this opportunity of stating, as some misunderstanding seems to exist on the point, that the scheme is intended as a sound economic contribution towards maintaining the Gaeltacht as well as a step towards strengthening the fishing industry.  The scope of the scheme will accordingly be strictly limited to the supply of boats and the necessary fishing gear to Irish-speaking fishermen resident in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the rates of gratuities or retirement grants paid to officers (by rank) leaving the Army on pension after 21 years' service and the corresponding rates paid to N.C.O.s and men.</P>

      <P>As the answer to the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that, as a result of the increase in Army pay which took place on the 1st April, 1953, the rates set out in the statement are due to be increased in respect of personnel who retired or were discharged since that date.  I regret I am not yet in a <Col N="275" /> position to bring the necessary statutory instrument before the House for approval.</P>
    <P>I may also say that I have a simplified pensions scheme for N.C.O.s <Col N="276" /> and men under consideration.  I hope that this scheme will provide for the payment of gratuities as well as pensions to N.C.O.s and men discharged after 21 or more years' service.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the spirit which animated the people in Waterford who have purchased the &ldquo;Lily Doreen&rdquo; and I regret that it has not yet been found possible to convey a decision about taking over the vessel.  I have arranged, however, to have the vessel surveyed and a decision will be reached when the survey has been completed.</P>

      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  The Bill will fill a gap which has existed in our law for a long time in that it will provide an up-to-date and effective law of arbitration.  The Bill deals with four types of arbitration. First if all, it provides for what is called voluntary arbitration, the essence of which is that the parties to some dispute refer that dispute to a tribunal of their own choosing instead of to a court of law.  Secondly, the Bill deals with statutory arbitrations namely, arbitrations by tribunals constituted under statute to settle particular types of disputes which arise as a result of statute.  Thirdly, the Bill covers references to arbitration by the High Court, where matters of account arise in cases before that court.  Finally, the Bill includes provision for the enforcement of foreign awards made pursuant to voluntary arbitration agreements between persons subject to the jurisdiction of the different contracting States which are or become parties to the 1927 Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards. I propose to deal with these four types of arbitration separately.</P>

    <P>The settlement of disputes by the decision of a person or body other than the appointed judicial authority has been recognised by all developed systems of law.  There was arbitration at Roman law and the institution is to be found in the systems of law prevailing on the European Continent. In countries which adopted the common law system such as Great Britain, the United States and our own country, voluntary arbitration <Col N="293" /> was also recognised.  At one time the law of arbitration was substantially the same in both England and Ireland but the English began to modernise this branch of their law as long ago as 1889, whereas our law has remained virtually unchanged for almost 100 years.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that the law in this country is defective in many respects.  One of the main defects is that a person who has gone to arbitration has to pay the arbitrator his fee for delivering an award without knowing beforehand whether or not the award is in his favour and in the certain knowledge that whether it be in his favour or not, he is not entitled to recover any costs from the unsuccessful party and will be out of pocket not merely by the amount of the arbitrator's fee (which may be quite substantial) but also by the amount of any payments that he may have had to make in respect of legal expenses or to secure the attendance of witnesses (which may be even more substantial).  Thus, a person may go to arbitration and secure a favourable award on all the points in dispute and yet be far worse off than if he had never gone to arbitration at all.  Suppose a motorist has a claim against his insurance company for an indemnity in respect of an accident which will cost the motorist, say, £300.  If the company disclaims liability the motorist cannot enforce his claim by taking court proceedings without first submitting to arbitration, for it is invariably provided in these motor insurance policies that an award of an arbitrator is a condition precedent to the liability of the company.  The arbitration may involve the payment of two arbitrators and an umpire to determine the dispute.  And when the arbitration proceedings are over, the motorist has got to pay the arbitration fees before he can take up the award and in addition, as I have already explained, to pay his own costs as well. The fees and costs may be little short of the amount in dispute and may even be in excess of that amount, so that a motorist who has a dispute with an insurance company is sometimes left <Col N="294" /> with no option, under the law as it stands, but to forgo his claim.</P>
    <P>Another defect in the existing law is that the authority of the arbitrator may be revoked by either party unless the arbitration agreement contains a provision that the submission to arbitration is to be made a rule of court.  As a result, each of the parties to an arbitration is at the mercy of the other since the authority of the arbitrator may be withdrawn at the whim of either party so that a person who has incurred heavy expense in connection with arbitration proceedings may find that he has thrown his money away.</P>
    <P>The Bill remedies these two defects and provides, in Part II, for various matters which arise in voluntary arbitration under arbitration agreements. The provisions in this part of the Bill are designed to give what I may call judicial cover to arbitration agreements, arbitration proceedings and the awards of arbitrators or umpires, so that arbitrations under Part II of the Bill will have the same sort of standing as actions before the High Court.  It will be observed that the High Court is being given a very large measure of control over arbitrations.  The court can intervene, as it thinks fit, in a number of ways and, in particular, there is reserved to the court the right to decide questions of law.  In this, it is proposed to follow the system that obtains in England and the United States.  The giving to the courts in England and in the United States of such large supervisory and controlling powers in arbitration cases has been the subject of adverse comment on the Continent where the powers of the courts with respect to arbitrations are generally more restricted and very precisely defined.  The system of arbitration proposed in the Bill appears to have worked very well in England and, in framing our proposals, we have naturally taken into account the experience of a country which belongs to the same legal family, by which I mean a country whose legal system is based on the common law.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, we must always have regard to the importance of the commercial relations between Ireland and England and between this country <Col N="295" /> and the United States.  I have mentioned the continental attitude to the question of arbitration lest it might be supposed that we had decided to follow the British system without giving any proper consideration to other alternatives.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with statutory arbitrations.  These are arbitrations under various statutes where disputes arising under the statutes are settled by particular persons designated by the statutes themselves. The persons appointed under these statutes are, of course, not arbitrators in the true sense, as they are not chosen by the parties, being in fact forced on them by the Legislature. In addition they are generally more &ldquo;valuers&rdquo; than &ldquo;arbitrators&rdquo;, and they settle questions which the particular statute alone has raised. Statutory arbitrations arise under numerous statutes such as the Church Temporalities Acts, the Irish Land Acts, the Railways Acts, the Drainage Acts, the Public Health Acts, Acts which relate to the acquiring of land for public purposes, etc.  Deputies will be familiar with cases of the compulsory or voluntary acquisition of land under various statutes such as the Electricity Supply Acts and the Air Navigation and Transport Act, in accordance with which the value of the land is to be decided by the arbitrator constituted under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The provisions of the Bill dealing with voluntary arbitrations, with the exception of certain sections, are applied to all these statutory arbitrations.  The excepted sections are those which are not pertinent to statutory arbitrations such as the provisions in regard to the death of a party, bankruptcy, biassed arbitrators, the powers of the High Court where an arbitrator has been removed, etc. It is to be noted, however, that, among the sections which do apply to statutory arbitrations, is Section 38 which gives power to the High Court to set aside an award.  Not every statutory tribunal may be an arbitral tribunal and it will be always necessary to consider, in relation to each statute, <Col N="296" /> whether the Legislature intended to set up an arbitral tribunal or not. This, of course, will be a matter for the courts.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from Section 48 of the Bill, it is proposed that, in applying the provisions of the Bill to statutory arbitrations, the statutory arbitration is to be treated as if it were arbitration under an arbitration agreement. Furthermore, under the section, the provisions of the Bill governing voluntary arbitrations will apply to statutory arbitrations except in so far as these provisions are inconsistent with the particular statute providing for the statutory arbitration or with any rules or procedure authorised thereby.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for references by the High Court of matters of account arising in any particular case to an arbitrator who shall be deemed to be an officer of the court. This part of the Act simply re-enacts and brings up to date certain provisions of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1856, but omits the requirement that the reference is to be made on the application of either party.  This type of arbitration is known as compulsory arbitration.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Act concerns the enforcement of any foreign arbitration award made in pursuance of an agreement, to which the Geneva Protocol of 1923 applies, between persons subject to the jurisdiction of States which are parties to the Geneva Convention of 1927.  The award shall be enforceable either by an action in the courts or it may be enforced under Section 41 in the same manner as a court judgment or order.  The conditions for the enforcement of foreign awards are set out in Section 56 and the evidence to be produced is dealt with in Section 57. The protocol of 1923 and the convention of 1927 are set out in the First and Second Schedules respectively.</P>
    <P>The protocol covers arbitrations arising under contracts relating to commercial matters or to other matters capable of settlement by arbitration, and the convention deals with the execution of awards made in pursuance of arbitration agreements to <Col N="297" /> which the protocol applies.  The protocol was defective in that it contained no effective provisions for the execution of a foreign award.  This was put right in the convention and the protocol and the convention are to be read together.  The main provisions of the convention are repeated in the actual sections of Part V of the Bill.  This country is not a party to either the protocol or the convention but accession has been delayed only because of lack of the legislation necessary to ensure their implementation in this country, the settled practice being never to undertake international obligations until after the enactment of such legislation as may be required to give the obligations effect in our domestic law.  The Bill before the House will remedy the position and we will be able to enforce effectively foreign arbitral awards in the same way as other countries.  It is the intention to accede to these international agreements and this will be done at the same time as Part V of the Bill is being brought into force by Government. Order under Section 1 (3) of the Bill. Under Section 54 the Government may also by Order declare the States which have ratified the convention of 1927 and made the necessary reciprocal provisions as will enable the convention to be operative.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to some specific provisions of the Bill which I have not touched on.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the State shall be bound by the proposed legislation, and this is a reasonable and proper provision.</P>
    <P>Section 5 excludes arbitrations under agreements relating to the terms and conditions of employment.  These are not arbitrations properly so called at all as the arbitrator has no power to make a final enforceable award, nor do the parties to the arbitration intend in any way that he should.  The section specifically excludes arbitration under Section 70 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which empowers the Labour Court, with the consent of the parties, to refer an actual or apprehended trade dispute to arbitration. Arbitrations dealing with conditions <Col N="298" /> of employment and trade disputes are really informal matters and it was decided that it should be made quite clear that the Bill was not to apply to them.  If the proposed legislation did apply, these arbitrations would have to be carried out in accordance with formal rules, and the law as to the swearing of witnesses, discovery of documents, costs, removal of the arbitrator by the High Court, etc., would apply to them.  I think everybody will agree that such arbitrations, if they can be properly so called, should not be treated in this manner. The arbitrators are really mediators who make recommendations and it is up to the parties to accept these recommendations or not to accept them as they so think fit.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the repeal of the existing statutory enactments as to arbitration, which are set out in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Bill, except the provisions dealing with foreign arbitration awards, is under Section 1 (2), designed to come into operation on the 1st January next. Part V, as I have pointed out, will be brought into operation by Government Order.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given Deputies a clear idea of what the Bill sets out to achieve.  Arbitration has many advantages in the settling of disputes, especially where technical knowledge or special skill or training is required. It is regarded as cheaper than law as a general rule and it is less formal and usually more expeditious.  The type of arbitration the Bill covers arises where there is a justifiable dispute or a dispute which in the ordinary way would be decided by the courts.  The Bill has been placed before the various bodies and persons interested and their suggestions for improvement have, where possible, been incorporated.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are generally on the same lines as the relevant British statutory provisions so that we will have the same law of arbitration here and across the water.  The law will also be the same as in the Six Counties.  The advantages of this to everybody concerned, and particularly <Col N="299" /> to the business and commercial community, are obvious.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. I realise that portions of it are technical and may not be easily understood at a first glance, but I hope to deal with any difficulties or suggestions on the Committee Stage when we can go through the Bill section by section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this Bill is really overdue.  The fact is that the law here is not as up to date in the matter of arbitration as it is in England and, for that reason, I suppose it is necessary to bring it up to date.  As this Bill is more of a Committee Stage Bill than a Second Stage Bill, I do not propose to say anything about it on the Second Stage.  We are not opposing the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of remarks on this Bill at this stage might not be out of place.  The Bill or some legislation to deal with arbitration is clearly necessary.  The position is that there was an Act in force in England that was occasionally, I might almost say commonly, adopted in its terms here explicitly in agreements.  That was more or less the position but that Act did not actually apply here and the law was not very satisfactory.  I have a recollection that there was an amending Act in England in recent years and I presume the Minister and his Department in drafting the Bill had reference to the experience and the working out of that Act. Altogether there would seem to be <i>prima facie</i> a case for introducing such a piece of legislation here.  The Government does wisely to bring it in at this time.  I shall not say there is a certain amount of slackness in the House, but this is a good opportunity for bringing in legislation that is not as urgent as another type of legislation that frequently takes up the time of the House, particularly when we come to the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one complaint in regard to arbitration that will be remedied by this Bill.  We can consider the relevant provisions more closely on Committee Stage.  Practitioners, more than once, have had occasion to complain that <Col N="300" /> under an arbitration clause a dispute &mdash;and it is a condition precedent to arbitration that there must be some matter in dispute&mdash;will be referred to arbitration after what amounts to the preliminary comings and goings in the course of law, in other words, the preliminary activities of counsel and solicitors, perhaps starting with correspondence and going right along until someone finds it is a matter for arbitration and it goes to arbitration. That whole procedure is just as expensive as if you were going into a full-scale legal action.</P>
    <P>I have heard it commonly stated that when a matter has gone to arbitration and when the award is made there is no provision in regard to costs and the person who has been successful before the arbitrator finds himself at a disadvantage in the matter of costs.  Frankly, I have not had actual experience of that&mdash;it would be the solicitors who would come directly in contact with that&mdash;but I have heard that complaint made because the arbitrator had not jurisdiction to determine costs the way our law lay, unless there was some explicit agreement. From a cursory glance at this Bill it does appear that that situation would be remedied.  There is a section enabling the arbitrator to determine costs and there is provision for taxation.</P>
    <P>That is just one example of the type of matter that should be dealt with in a Bill of this nature.  I would strongly recommend the Minister, particularly on Committee Stage, on each section, to consult the solicitors, in particular, with regard to the difficulties that have arisen in the past in regard to arbitration. I do not think it would be quite enough in this country to take the English precedent, even tried English precedent, without checking it against the circumstances here, as operating here.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister, right through this, that the solicitors' body as a whole should be consulted and, indeed, the Bar also &mdash;but I think the solicitors are more directly concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one point perhaps that I might appropriately make here, having <Col N="301" /> some little personal knowledge.  At the same time I have no axe to grind, so to speak, in the matter.  It is an illusion in this country to think that arbitration will be any cheaper or that any of these extraneous machineries will be any cheaper or more expeditious to the parties than the normal course of law and of the courts. Remember, in any event, the law will rule.  There are certain misconceptions in regard to the law of arbitration, mainly to the effect that the arbitrator can do anything, law or no law, which, of course, is not correct.  He will be bound by the law, except in so far as there are explicit agreements to the contrary.  We need not go into technical details here.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make is that it is largely an illusion to think that by such clauses as arbitration clauses and provisions for special tribunals of that sort the parties will be saved costs.  You may save one particular type of party the costs but, generally speaking, from the point of view of equity between individuals, citizens and parties, arbitrations and similar proceedings can be every bit as, if not more expensive than the courts. It is a point to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Again, I have not any particular axe to grind in the matter, but it might be appropriate, as I have some slight knowledge of it, to say that I am not so sure that, unless there is something technical in the nature of the issues, if you are going to have arbitration you should not have arbitration on the same basis as you have trial in court, in other words, that arbitration should be a job for trained lawyers.  I say that with all deliberation and completely from the point of view of the community at large, not from the point of view of any particular profession or interest.  When all is said and done, it will be a question of the rights of the parties; it will be a question of the construction of agreements and all that kind of thing.  That, clearly, is a function for a trained lawyer.</P>
    <P>I am not quite so sure, taking arbitration by and large, where a number of things have to be decided, that it should not be restricted to people with these qualifications.  Of <Col N="302" /> course, there is a qualification to that, naturally, in the case of a question of fact on some technical matter.  Just as you bring in a medical referee, as they used to do in workmen's compensation cases, you might get some independent engineers to decide an engineering problem or an engineering matter.  That is a somewhat different thing from determining an award or substituting arbitration for a proceeding in court.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister should consider something along these lines but, by and large, having said that, it seems that the Bill, on the face of it, is more or less what is wanted.  As Deputy Boland said, it is a Bill that can be dealt with on the Committee Stage better than on Second Reading.  Quite obviously, the provisions in regard to foreign awards and these things that the Minister has told us about in his opening statement are necessary enough.</P>
    <P>The one thing that we must guard against in our approach to this Bill is the idea that arbitration gets away from the law, that you completely wipe out the law.  That can be only so in so far as explicitly provided. Even then it must accord with the general principles of justice.  I think that is all we can usefully contribute on this stage of the Bill.  Section by section we can deal with it on the Committee Stage.  Would the Minister consider whether this Bill is one for Committee in the House or one for consideration by a committee selected by the House, to report back to the House?  It is the type of Bill where perhaps deliberation in a committee room by a number of Deputies in the usual way might be more satisfactory. On the other hand, if there is time in the House, I suppose the more general principle should be followed, that most of our business should be done here.</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy de Valera's point, we have consulted the Law Society.  On the question of arbitration, many employers would prefer to have the arbitration in private in connection with certain businesses, instead of having public <Col N="303" /> arbitration.  That is to say, many business people would prefer to have questions in dispute decided privately by arbitration.  In regard to the Committee Stage, I think it would be better to have the matter discussed here by Deputies in the whole House rather than set up another committee and postpone the matter.</P>

      <P>That was one of the points I was making, that arbitration in private would have an interest for the big business but arbitration can be a difficult thing enough for the private citizen.  Supposing there is some agreement between a private citizen and some concern, the first difficulty that is arising to-day in that type of agreement is the cost question; the second one is that it is questionable whether it is not in the interest of the single individual, as against the more powerful concern, that the matter be dealt with publicly.  However, that is inherent in the nature of arbitration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 111 of the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 of 1954), are hereby repealed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to repeal the provisions of Section 111 of the Defence Act, 1954, which repeat the provisions of the 1893 Public Authorities Protection Act in so far as actions against persons acting in pursuance of the 1954 Act are concerned. Under Section 111 of the 1954 Act persons acting under the Act are protected in that actions against them must be taken within six months of the act, neglect or default complained of and the special provisions as to solicitor and client costs contained in the 1893 Act apply to such actions. These actions must be taken in the High Court but this provision is not being repealed.  Neither is the provision in Section 111 which says that actions in respect of sentences imposed by or anything done by virtue of a court-martial shall be brought in the High Court.  Therefore, in future, under the amendment, actions against persons acting under the 1954 Act (including actions concerned with the results of a court-martial) will not have the restrictive provisions of the 1893 Act applied to them but they will still have to be taken in the High Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;if the cause of action accrued before the first day of July, 1954&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;if the action, prosecution or other proceedings has been commenced on the date of the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in tabling this amendment to sub-section (4) is to distinguish <Col N="305" /> between the time cause of action would accrue and the date of the commencement of proceedings.  As I read the Bill, I envisaged a situation in which, after the 1st January next, one could still have a plea relying upon the provisions of the 1893 Act, at a time when this particular Bill which is going through the House would be law; so that one would have the most extraordinary position of relying upon an Act which would have been repealed. I thought, therefore, the best way out of that peculiar anomaly which I foresaw was to table this amendment, to get rid of the words relating to the cause of action and simply have the new Bill, when it becomes law on the 1st January next, referring only to actions taken after the 1st January.</P>
    <P>It is my experience, and I am sure that other people interested in this Bill have much greater experience, that the time when the cause of action accrues is often a most arguable state of affairs, to say the least of it. Accordingly, one could easily have a situation where the time of cause of action could be argued successfully, even after the passing of this Bill, to have accrued&mdash;to be related to an incident prior to the 1st July and that nevertheless the cause of action itself would be established to have arisen after the 1st July.  Then you would have this extraordinary position of relying upon the provisions of an Act which had been repealed.  It is for these motives and with a view to clearing up the situation&mdash;which occurred in my mind, at any rate&mdash;that I have tabled this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the amendment.  The purpose of the Deputy's amendment is to provide that the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, shall not affect any proceedings unless these proceedings have been begun at the date of the passing of the new legislation.  Under the Bill the 1893 Act will apply to all such proceedings unless the cause of action arose on or after the 1st July last.  The reason for the provision in the Bill is to prevent stale claims being made against public authorities, that is, claims in <Col N="306" /> regard to matters which arose, say, three or four years ago.  It is to be noted that under the Bill the 1893 Act cannot be pleaded if the cause of action arises on or after the 1st July last no matter when the act of the public authority takes place.  Thus, if a public authority does something in 1949 and a person does not suffer actionable injury until last September, the 1893 Act cannot be pleaded, whereas at present it can be pleaded and forms a good defence.  The plaintiff at present in such a case as I have mentioned would lose his action because time runs from the act of the public authority and not from the date the cause of action arises.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment though I can appreciate his reasoning.  We must, however, prevent out-of-date claims being made against public authorities and we do not want to interfere too drastically with the existing rights of public authorities where causes of action have arisen.</P>

      <P>May I say that I appreciate what was behind the amendment which was moved by Deputy Lindsay and, to a considerable extent, I have sympathy, not with the form of his amendment but with the idea behind it?  I am afraid the form of the amendment would probably not achieve what he desires to have achieved because it would result in the fact that, in cases where actions have actually been instituted on the coming into operation of this Act, the Public Authorities Protection Act could be pleaded but, in reference to stale actions which had arisen years ago, it could not be pleaded.  I do not think that is what Deputy Lindsay meant. The trouble arises from the word &ldquo;accrued&rdquo; in sub-section (4) of this section: &ldquo;... if the cause of the action accrued before the first day of July, 1954.&rdquo;  I am sure that that is what was in Deputy Lindsay's mind. We were open to conviction on that <Col N="307" /> score, provided stale demands were conceded.  The date in the Bill&mdash;the 1st July&mdash;was taken purely empirically. The word &ldquo;accrued&rdquo; may possibly give rise to difficulties.  If Deputy Lindsay was afraid the cause of the action accrued before the 1st July but did not emerge as an injury until after that date, something might be said for that viewpoint.  The only thing intended to be covered in sub-section (4) was the prevention of stale demands.  For instance, cases arose years ago in which the Public Authorities Protection Act would have been part of the proceedings.  Perhaps <i>ex gratia</i> payments have been made but it would be very difficult if all these claims could be raised again when, perhaps, the witnesses have gone, and certain injustices might be done.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Second Reading, it was mentioned from this side of the House that a number of members of our Party&mdash;in fact, the majority of them&mdash;think the six-year period in which to take an action against a local authority is too long.  The Taoiseach has just referred to stale actions.  I think an action taken against a local authority after six years could be called a very stale action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that he was considering amending the Statute of Limitations.  I do not know whether or not he has thought over the matter <Col N="308" /> since, but that is what he said.  The opinion here&mdash;and I share it&mdash;is that three years, or something like that, would be more appropriate for ordinary actions.  We agree that the individual and the local authority should have the same status.  The majority here feel that the public authority and the individual should be the same but that the period is too long.  I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach means to take immediate action or how he intends to tackle the matter.  It was suggested here that perhaps a committee composed of experienced and able Deputies from both sides of the House, such as members of local authorities, and so forth, might be appointed to consider it.  We think something should be done to shorten the period in which action might be taken.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with what Deputy Boland has just said, that is, that the period of limitation is, in general, too long.  It had always been my intention to have a Bill dealing generally with the Statute of Limitations brought in.  That is being drafted at the moment.  We should be very glad of the Deputy's co-operation and assistance in working out what would be the proper period of limitation.  Perhaps, when the Bill is drafted, we could give a copy of our suggestions to the Deputy and we would be able to have his co-operation and counter-suggestions and, if the Deputy thought it desirable, we would accept his offer of co-operation from people of experience on both sides of the House.  It is a matter which affects the public generally and all points of view should be considered.  I shall endeavour to have the Bill drafted within the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill proposes to amend the law in relation to the preservation of national monuments. Experience of the working of the National Monuments Act, 1930, has brought to light certain practical difficulties which it is desired to resolve, and some simplification of procedure is also proposed.  The 1930 Act, which defines the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo; in a very comprehensive manner, enabled the Commissioners of Public Works or local authorities to become the guardians or owners as the case may be, of any monument</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching thereto&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our country is very rich in monuments but it is not possible for the State to assume ownership or guardianship of every monument which might be represented as worthy of preservation.  A choice of the most important must therefore be made.  There are about 500 monuments or groups of monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works for maintenance.  About 200 of these have been dealt with under the 1930 Act and the balance under earlier enactments. In addition some 200 Preservation Orders have been made under the 1930 Act with a view to preventing demolition, removal, injury, defacement, etc., of the structures covered by the Orders.</P>
      <P>The amendments now proposed are mostly of a machinery or administrative character, the more important being:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Provision to enable the transfer if considered necessary to the Commissioners of Public Works from local authorities of national monuments of special interest which are in the guardianship or ownership of such authorities but which under existing law cannot be transferred;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Provision to expedite the issue of Preservation Orders so as <Col N="310" /> to render this procedure less cumbrous in administration and therefore more valuable and effective;</P>
    <P>(c) Provision for the making of temporary Preservation Orders to afford protection to monuments which are discovered to be in immediate danger of injury;</P>
    <P>(d) Provision to secure that certain monuments to be specified in published lists shall not be interfered with without notice to the Commissioners of Public Works;</P>
    <P>(e) Provision to enable a national monument in the ownership of the Commissioners of Public Works to be removed to the site of another national monument if the commissioners consider such a course desirable;</P>
    <P>(f) Provision whereby in urgent cases authorised persons can be permitted to conduct an archaeological excavation without a formal licence;</P>
    <P>(g) Provision to strengthen the position in the matter of the restriction of the illegal export of archaeological objects;</P>
    <P>(h) Provision to place the National Monuments Advisory Council on a more appropriate basis as regards tenure of office and to give more latitude in the nomination of <i>ex-officio</i> members.</P>
    <P>That is the general scheme of the Bill and a summary of the main provisions. So far as the detailed provisions are concerned I think it is hardly necessary for me to go into them at any great length but if any Deputy would wish that I would, even on this Second Stage, go into any section in detail, of course I will be glad to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the National Monuments Bill of 1930 was being discussed in the Dáil, a great many fears were expressed about the danger that might be contained in the Bill in regard to intrusion on individual rights and property.  Experience has shown that those fears were groundless and events have proved that the action taken then was a wise action.  I think <Col N="311" /> we can approach this Bill, which is a broader one, with less timidity than the previous Bill was approached.  This Bill, as I see it, makes further provisions for the protection and preservation of national monuments, the prevention of their destruction, and ensures that the educational and prestige value of these monuments, buildings and objects as such, shall not be lost to the nation.  The difficulty of framing a Bill in their regard that will ensure against any possible infringement or alleged infringement of individual rights is so great that we can only try to weigh the eventual national benefit against any minor, temporary individual inconvenience, and we must be prepared to run the risk of occasionally creating such an inconvenience in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Our considered views embodied in a measure of this nature should be slightly in advance of current public opinion, if public opinion is to be properly informed, interested and formulated along the right lines.  I believe that conditions in regard to matters of this sort are to-day far better than they were in 1930.  There is greater interest generally, a wider knowledge and a more obvious desire on the part of the public to co-operate with the authorities.  Sometimes I do personally think that it is impossible to concede all the demands that are made for the care and protection of buildings of reputedly historical importance, and generous as I would wish the State to be in a matter of this sort, I do realise that there must be a limit to expenditure.  I have in mind principally demands, sometimes very insistent, for the protection and preservation of a number of 18th Century houses, the architectural features of which are altogether similar, and I do think the preservation of a few outstanding examples should be adequate.  Many of the demands made concern buildings whose historical significance is &ldquo;That lowlier rooftrees are sturdier for their fall&rdquo; and I am not displaying any interest in those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, legislation will be of very little use if we are not prepared to <Col N="312" /> make adequate provision for taking advantage of the power the Dáil will give.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that all we need is legal authority and has he any misgivings as I have about the adequacy of inspectorial staff and field staff?  The Minister must remember also what an important place the national monument must have in any such work as this and he must be aware that it is impossible to care for properly and display properly the material already acquired, material which is being daily accumulated due to the inadequacy of space in the museum.  I think further that the Minister might look into the fact that the museum staff has been greatly diminished for various reasons. This will be an agreed measure and I do not think the Dáil will at any time oppose the needed expenditure and the Minister should ensure in putting this piece of legislation through that its effect will not be nullified, no matter how difficult his position is, by the lack of adequate financial provision.</P>

      <P>I have always had a deep interest in our historical monuments. I happen to be a member for a long time of the historical society and I now have the honour to be chairman of that society in Waterford.  In regard to this measure Deputy Moylan mentioned the museum.  I am not sure whether the museum is under the authority of the Minister or not but there are museum pieces that could be classed as national monuments even though they might be only small items and they have been acquired by the museum.  That is a good thing, but the museum has so many objects there that they are not able to display them and many of the pieces that the museum has acquired would have more of a local interest than a Dublin interest and, wherever possible, these items should be sent down the country on permanent loan to the various centres if local authorities or local people are prepared to provide for their permanent exhibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important problems facing the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash;and they have done their work <Col N="313" /> very well in preserving monuments&mdash;is the sign-posting after preservation.  It is very important to have it done in as concise a form as possible in relation to the historical place, building, monument or whatever the object may be. There is a danger, and there has been a danger during the past seven or eight years, of the destruction and the wiping out altogether of the various <i>liosanna</i> and mounds that are spread throughout the country.  They were preserved down through the years, some say through the superstition of the people, who thought if they removed them or did anything to them that they might bring them bad luck or that the fairies might come out.  Now, of course, we are in a mechanical age and we have acquired such things as bulldozers and tractors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy regard Master McGrath as a national monument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Moylan will agree with me in saying that Master McGrath's monument is now quite safe.  It would have disappeared but for the accident of a car which went astray at midnight and the arrival of four famous cock-fighters at the monument to find it was lost in a forest.  However, I am off the point but Deputy Moylan and a few others know what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>Sign-posting is very important.  I do not know whether this is a matter for the Commissioner of Public Works or the local authorities.  I have in mind places such as New Ross.  The battle of Ross was fought in the streets of New Ross but with the exception of the Three Bullet Gate there are no markers there.  There is nothing to show where and how the battle was fought.  It was on that account principally that I got up to speak.  I consider that we should have some marker in the street from Three Bullet Gate to show that 16,000 patriots fell in the teeth of cannon fire. It was cannon fire which brought them down and not drink.  That should be recorded for all to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going through the country, I notice that there are various monuments erected in memory of men who gave their lives for the Republic in the War <Col N="314" /> of Independence.  That was a noble deed.  We should have markers to show what happened.  I have in mind national shrines such as they have in America.  In Lexington, for example, they might have a rock on which would be inscribed&mdash;I cannot think at the moment of an American patriot but I am sure Deputy Moylan will not object to my using his name to illustrate what I mean&mdash;&ldquo;Here stood Seán Moylan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here fell so-and-so&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here stood the enemy&rdquo;.  I think we should commemorate these actions in that manner and not&mdash;I hope the House will excuse me for using the expression&mdash; in a casual manner as is being done at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Commissioners of Public Works in regard to their work on the various monuments throughout the country. They did a magnificent job on Jerpoint Abbey in County Kilkenny and on Carrick Castle.  In another ten years the roof of that castle would have fallen in.  They have now preserved that.  Before I conclude, I should like to impress on the Minister that the matter of sign-posting is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  Very many ancient monuments, castles and abbeys are being allowed to go into ruin because the idea prevails that only one of a particular type should be taken over and preserved.  These castles and abbeys are all equally important for their own localities.  There is a castle in Monkstown which is in a good state of preservation.  Very many of these have gone to ruin and are lost to their own areas because of the attitude to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that you have advisory bodies connected with county councils and corporations.  They make an effort to do something in their own counties each year.  I do not know who allocates the funds to them but the £100 or £200 which is at their disposal each year for this purpose is really so small that nothing can be done without waiting four or five years by which time more and more damage is done by <Col N="315" /> reason of the fact that attention was not given when it should be given.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the craftsmen who can bring about the restoration of these monuments in their original shape or as near to it as possible are gradually diminishing.  There is no time to be wasted if these monuments are to be taken over and preserved as they should be by craftsmen who know their work and who are skilled in it.  No doubt, we have a number of these still and advantage should be taken of them.</P>
    <P>Houses of national and cultural significance have been destroyed in recent years because they did not come under the category of ancient monuments.  They are not ancient to their generation but they will be ancient for the generations to come. If what is left of them is preserved now&mdash;too many of them, unfortunately, have been demolished&mdash;the question always comes up: &ldquo;Oh, it will be too expensive to maintain.&rdquo;  We are losing the culture and contacts with the traditions of our race very often for the sake of the expenditure of a few hundred pounds per year.  If education and the preservation of the physical side, so to speak, of our history is not worth that it seems amazing to me that we try to teach from books what we have in our countryside if proper attention is given to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo, I am not going to compliment the commissioners on their work in preserving ancient monuments.  They have pointed and done some work on certain monuments over a number of years.  They have left them under the care of caretakers whose duties do not appear to be specified.  The monuments become overgrown with weeds, shrubs, small trees and everything else.  The money spent on them is a dead loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of Fore Abbey which is one of the most historical piles we have in the Midlands.  The Board of Works spent some hundreds of pounds on it years ago.  They did a good job on it.  They pointed the old gates going into the City of Fore and they pointed the old abbey.  They did some <Col N="316" /> preservation on the cloisters, which they dug up and reconstructed, but they then let the place go into decay. In the last two years, however, the local branch of Muintir na Tíre had on their own initiative pulled up the weeds and bushes and cleared a way in out of their own funds.  Without this action and without the sand and gravel which had been put down, I believe that Fore Abbey would be unapproachable. From the tourist point of view, there were often as many as seven C.I.E. buses in the village on the one day, and the tourists had to go and look for the caretaker to get the key.  A book giving the historical background to the abbey had been produced some years ago and in order to obtain this very well-turned-out publication they had to go to the local public-house where possibly a copy would be procured for them.  That was not a proper way to do things.  The caretaker's duties should be well defined and there should be some place where the tourists could get a copy of the historical associations of the monument. The caretaker should be available at all times and the monument should not be under lock and key except at night.</P>
    <P>The preservation of historical monuments requires the co-ordination of many Departments in the State.  Up to this year practically every road leading to the village of Fore was nearly impassable.  One road was repaired this year and about four others remain to be done.  The cooperation of the Department of Local Government is necessary so that grants could be made available for these roads.  Fógra Fáilte&mdash;whose fate we do not know&mdash;did show a keen interest in the past year in the matter of roads.  It should be a matter for the Oireachtas and the Government to see that ruined walls and unsightly approaches to this monument and others are removed, and that where there is a green&mdash;as in the village of Fore&mdash;it should be planted with shrubs and trees.  In other countries where they have monuments not half so valuable, this was done.  I do not know if there are greater monuments historically or architecturally than ours in other countries, but I do know <Col N="317" /> that if other countries had the monuments we have the road approaches to them would be good and there would be shrubs and suitable small trees planted along the highway.  That should be our approach to the matter, too.</P>
    <P>In my county, we have a number of these monuments, On one of the islands in the Shannon we have a very historic church, and while I cannot give the architectural details of it, I think it is preserved by the Board of Works.  It is worth going to see, but if you do, you have to inquire where the island is, whether a boat is available, and who will row you across.  You need to be well versed to know the island is there at all, and that there is such an historic church on it.  As I said about Fore, if they had such an island anywhere else with such ruins they would do everything to attract tourists to it, and there would be printed literature available.</P>
    <P>Fógra Fáilte and the Board of Works are, I think, considering the preservation of Delvin Castle and village, and the building there has become a positive danger to the houses around about, and if some action is not taken soon, it will fall and kill someone.  We cannot have delay in these matters if we want to preserve these monuments and if we do not want them to do damage.  I draw the attention of the Minister and those responsible for this Bill to that particular point.</P>
    <P>Again, in my county we have&mdash;I think it is a combination&mdash;the remains of a castle and church at Kirpatrick.  There you have a stone roof far and away bigger and better than the one that is preserved at Glendalough.  I draw attention to the fact that in one corner it is beginning to fall in.  I have drawn the attention of Fógra Fáilte to that fact.  There is also an old Norman keep at Newtown which attracted many people, but again the approaches are impassable, and if this Bill is going to do anything it should remedy such situations.  I saw in Wales and in many other countries of Europe the meticulous care and the amount of money spent on things of lesser value.</P>
    <P>One of the Deputies&mdash;I think it was Deputy Lynch&mdash;on the other side referred <Col N="318" /> to the monuments to patriots, and said that they should be preserved, and I endorse what he said.  When we think of the magnificent work put into the '98 monuments by Irish artists 60 years ago and contrast it with the atrocities being put up now to the men of 1921, surely we should go down to Wicklow and honour our artists, the Hogans and the rest of them, who did splendid creative work in marble and stone in Wicklow and elsewhere and ensure that these monuments are preserved.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with the Deputy that we should make any endeavour to preserve the atrocities costing hundreds of pounds which have been put up to the 1921 men.  I believe it is intended to put up one proper monument and that is the one at the Custom House.  But when we look at the things they are putting up now to men of our own generation I would not agree with the Deputy that we should preserve them. We should do everything possible to preserve the work done 60 years ago to honour the men of '98.</P>
    <P>I do hope that as a result of this Bill the approaches to all our historical piles and buildings will be made passable, that proper roadsides and greens will be provided and that we will have a great speed-up in the Board of Works.  Those responsible in the Board of Works for deciding whether something is worth preserving or not should take a broader view.  There are places like Killafree in County West-meath with monuments which might not meet the eye or the taste of an expert but which are of grave significance to the local people who take a great pride in them.  They can trace their history back 400 or 500 years and when local people through their local county councils draw attention to these things as being worth preserving, the experts in the Board of Works should have a broader and a more tolerant approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of the introduction of this Bill to refer to a number of matters relating to national monuments generally which are declared to come under the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works.  From time to <Col N="319" /> time I have been receiving complaints from visitors and other people of the undesirability of permitting cattle to be grazed in close proximity to national monuments.</P>
      <P>I will give a specific instance.  I am informed of the case of a very important and exceedingly historic national monument, an abbey surrounded by a substantial wall, with an entrance gate.  This abbey and the surrounding wall are situated in a large field in which cattle graze from time to time.  While there is no criticism of cattle grazing there, it has been suggested that it is highly undesirable that the gate in the wall surrounding the abbey should be left open and cattle permitted to graze within the precincts of the monument, including part of the Abbey at present in ruins.  The whole appearance detracts very much from the beauty and history of the abbey and visitors are anything but impressed by the filthy condition of the ground around it through which they have to walk when visiting the ruins.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there may be many difficulties in the way of providing a remedy.  However, I think the Minister and his advisers might think the matter over and see if it is possible to do anything to cover the point I have raised.  I think that it might be necessary for the Minister to take powers to authorise the various national monuments committees to expend some money to meet such cases and ensure that adequate protection is provided.  I know of ruined castles which are used as byres for cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 deals with burials in specified parts of national monuments, and I should like to draw attention to the fact that throughout the country there are quite a number of burial grounds in some way associated with an abbey of historical note or something of that kind.  As an example of what I want to draw attention to, I quote Glendalough.  Sometimes during the summer season, at least 20 bus-loads of visitors are brought from Dublin to Glendalough and they cannot be very much impressed when they enter through the cathedral gate <Col N="320" /> there to find themselves, if it is a wet day, up to their knees in wet grass which, in some cases, is many feet high as I saw it only last year.  If they take a walk down towards the other ruins there, they will find that the ground is all muddy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have it thought that I am criticising the Board of Works for that; the point I want to make is that I think the commissioners should try to make some effort where ruins of such historical note as Glendalough and the Seven Churches are concerned, to ensure that at least the burial grounds should be put in proper condition.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 8, which deals with publication of lists of national monuments, I suggest that the Minister should consider implementing this section and have a list or record of monuments in each county which are under the care of the Commissioners of Public Works circulated.  There may be difficulties in that, but I think they would be of considerable interest to visitors who would know where these monuments are.  As a result of visitors not having definite and correct information at present, some old story is told to them and the monuments are turned into something more amusing than anything else.</P>
    <P>These remarks are not intended as a criticism of the Commissioners of the Board of Works.  I realise the difficulties they have.  They are matters that are apparently not under their jurisdiction about which I am complaining, and I am sure they will receive attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the remarks made by Deputy Doyle about the work done by the Commissioners of Public Works in regard to ancient monuments.  The truth of the matter is probably that no Government Department is really either equipped or devised so as to be able to undertake work of this kind absolutely satisfactorily.  There are quite a number of difficulties involved and what I would like to urge on the Minister, and through him, on the Commissioners of Public Works, is that they should encourage as much as possible local committees and local <Col N="321" /> associations.  There are quite a number of these in existence at the moment in different parts of the country. Naturally, they vary in character.  In some places, there may be a very responsible and able committee and they could probably help much more than any caretakers or any officials from Dublin.  My one appeal to the Minister would be to urge the commissioners to make the fullest possible use of local committees, county committees and county organisations, which have been set up in many areas to look after ancient monuments.  The problem is by no means simple, and, of course, the commissioners will have to exercise fairly careful supervision over the work done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle mentioned a particular case&mdash;I do not quite know what monument it was&mdash;and complained that cattle were allowed to graze too close to it.  I know that in many cases it is an advantage to have cattle close to monuments of this kind because they keep down the briars, nettles and various weeds which very often tend to undermine a monument, including ivy, and I have seen many cases of monuments close to which cattle have been in the habit of grazing which were in a better state of preservation than monuments which were completely railed off, because in the case of monuments which are completely railed off, the briars and nettles had taken over completely</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I was interested to hear Deputy Kennedy refer to an island on the Shannon, on Lough Ree. I take it he was referring to Inchleraun, which, with Clonmacnoise, is probably the most important monument we have of that period, the fifth or sixth century.  There are on Inchleraun a number of fairly well preserved remains which are extremely interesting. Deputy Kennedy complained that it was very hard to get there and very hard for anybody to see the monument because there was no way of finding out where it was and they could get no boats to get there.  I should like to add that even if they did get on Inchleraun, they would find it extremely hard to see the remains on account of the growth of briars, nettles and booha-launs. I do not know that it is part of <Col N="322" /> the function of the caretaker to keep these down, probably not; probably his function is to see that nobody interferes with what is there but I feel that if you had a local committee, some kind of local development association or some responsible committee in the neighbourhood they could quite easily supervise any work that needs to be done in order to preserve these monuments and make them available.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are three problems to be dealt with.  First of all, there is the question of preserving what we have and there, as I pointed out, much has to be done by purely local initiative with the assistance and supervision of the Board of Works.  The second task is that of using the monuments that we have as a form of attraction for tourists and visitors and also for promoting local interest, historical interest, in the monuments we have.  That is essentially a publicity task.  I would ask the commissioners, if they do issue a list of monuments or any publicity matter, to try to get away from the stereotyped kind of Government publication and to get these things done a little more attractively. There have been some most useful publications issued by the Government Publications Office with regard to some of our Irish monuments.  They may be very satisfactory from the purely antiquarian or archaeological point of view but I feel that we should try to make them a little more up to date, a little more stream-lined, so that they can be used for visitors and tourists as well.</P>
    <P>The third problem, which is a more complicated one, in a number of cases where old monuments or old buildings of historical importance are collapsing or are on the verge of collapse, is the extent to which the work of restoration should be undertaken.  I know in many cases it should not be undertaken. Perhaps it would spoil the value of the original monuments.  I think, however, in a number of cases the commissioners might well consider the actual restoration of certain monuments. There, again, it is a matter in which we should move very carefully and cautiously but it is a thing that should be considered.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the commissioners will make the fullest use possible <Col N="323" /> of voluntary organisations in connection with this work.  A problem that we have in connection with this type of work, not only in this Department but in many other Departments, is the question of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the Civil Service organisation.  I do not think it has ever been approached in an entirely satisfactory manner.  The Civil Service, I believe, seem to think very often that voluntary committees are more a hindrance than a help. Naturally the approach of civilians to problems of this kind is entirely different from the approach of the Civil Service.  I think we should aim at trying to get some method of co-ordination between the local voluntary organisations and the Commissioners of Public Works on this question.</P>

Ba mhaith liom níos mó suim a fheiceáil ag an bpobal i gcoitinne sna sean-fhoirgnimh seo.  Dá mbeadh níos mó tuisceana ag na daoine tríd an tír san obair seo, d'fhéadfaí i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh faoi'n gceist seo.  Caithfimíd suim na ndaoine a mhúscailt sa rud seo.  Nuair a bheidh sé sin againn beidh leath na hoibre déanta againn.  Is é tá ag cur imní orm ná an bhfuil airgead go leor le cur ar fáil le haghaidh na hoibre seo.  Dá mbeadh an Aire Airgeadais sásta níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil, sílim go rachamíd ar aghaidh níos fearr leis an obair. Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh níos mó dlúbhaint idir Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus Fógra Fáilte chun ár sean iarsmaí stairiúla a shábháil.  Tá meascán mearaí anseo idir an obair atá ar siúl sa dá oifig.  Thóg Fógra Fáilte suas an obair seo tar éis an Bille Cuairtíochta a chur i bhfeidhm ag an Dáil agus tá cuid mhaith oibre déanta acu ar fuaid na tíre.

      <P>I welcome this Bill because I believe a nation largely depends for its individual identity on its historical and cultural background and on its monuments.  Perhaps we have not, heretofore, given sufficient attention to such matters.  Possibly there <Col N="325" /> is a certain difficulty in the situation because so many different Departments are concerned.  This Bill represents a new approach towards unifying the work and, under it, the Minister for Finance, through the Commissioners of Public Works, will be in a position in future to give attention to our monuments.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy MacBride that societies, such as historical and antiquarian societies and so forth, which are functioning through private enterprise should be utilised in the development and maintenance of our monuments. I welcome the fact that under this measure the commissioners will be in a position in future to take over and attend to monuments with greater facility than they have been in the past.  In my own constituency there has been a certain amount of delay in the taking over of monuments.  I think this Bill will go a long way towards meeting that difficulty in the future.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which I would like to draw attention.  I do not see anything in this Bill&mdash;perhaps the Minister will consider this point&mdash; covering Irish monuments abroad. From time to time many famous Irishmen have had to leave our shores. They have served abroad with honour and distinction.  The other day the case of a famous Wexford man, Myles Byrne, was brought to my notice.  He is buried in Montmartre in Paris, and there is no distinguishing mark of any kind on his grave.  It should be possible through the medium of this Bill, or some similar legislation, to ensure that our ambassadors are placed in a position to attend to such monuments.  It is only right and fitting that famous Irishmen of bygone generations should have tribute paid to them by the present generation of Irishmen.  These men were forced to leave the country.  They served all over the world with honour and distinction and they are entitled to receive from the present generation the consideration that is their just reward.  I ask the Minister to consider the position from that angle and to ensure that no monument anywhere in the world representing an Irishman is left untended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> As far as our own native monuments are concerned, I do not think they receive the attention they should receive.  Every year there is an enormous influx of tourists, and it is only right that we should preserve our historic and cultural traditions by preserving our monuments and the approaches to them in the way in which they should be preserved. It should be made possible for our visitors to view these permanent characteristics of our civilisation, characteristics which speak such volumes for the best traditional, cultural and Christian standards of the Irish nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Teachta Ó Briain has said, the main difficulty in this matter is lack of money.  There is a good deal of work to be done in relation to our ancient monuments.  In order to do that work more money will have to be provided.  First of all, we have to deal with the actual monuments. Secondly, the approaches to these must be improved.  Damage suffered by these monuments because of the passage of time and other factors must be remedied.</P>
      <P>As an Teachta Ó Briain said also, it will be necessary to compile a list, or lists, of these monuments.  I would myself be in favour of a list for each county.  That list should be available &mdash;possibly in the county council offices &mdash;so that people who are interested could find out where the monuments are and know something of their history before they actually visit them. Thirdly, it will be necessary to have a history compiled&mdash;I realise that this would not be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works but rather for the Department of Education&mdash;in pamphlet form relating to each monument and that history should be made available to primary schools.  Teachers of primary schools find it very difficult to get authoritative information on many important ancient monuments and such information should be compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder why this work, which is of national importance, was given to the Commissioners of Public Works.  It is work that could be taken under the <Col N="327" /> wing of An Bord Fáilte.  In Donegal there is the Grianan of Aileach, the seat of the ancient kings of Ireland, a prehistoric, circular fort.  Recently, a very fine road was built going into that monument by An Bord Fáilte, by moneys provided by the board.  It cost £2,000.  Now the approach to that ancient monument is perfect whereas the monument itself remains neglected and dilapidated with stones thrown here and there.</P>
    <P>If the care of ancient monuments were transferred to An Bord Fáilte or to the Department of Education it would be much better than the present position.  As I understand it, under the 1952 Act, An Bord Fáilte have certain responsibility and have been empowered to spend money on ancient monuments.  The attention, therefore, that is paid to these monuments is more or less divided.  Co-ordination is needed.  A body such as An Bord Fáilte that has spent over £2,000 on a roadway into one of our ancient monuments should have the further authority to spend money on the monument itself.</P>
    <P>More and better signs should be erected pointing the way to these monuments.  Tourists may pass very near important ancient monuments and be unaware of it.  They may even be looking for them and cannot find them.  Proper signs should be erected.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is that whoever is charged with the responsibility of looking after the monuments should have more money to do the work that requires to be done.  The longer this work is delayed the greater the amount to be expended must be. As each day passes greater damage is being done.  More money should be made available to remedy that position.</P>

Nuair abraim &ldquo;iargcúlta&rdquo; nílim ag tagairt do cheantar ar bith sa tír.  D'fhéadfadh sean-fhoirgneamh a bheith iargcúlta agus a bheith suite i gContae Atha Cliath.

Ní hé gurb é an ceann is seanda agus is ársa i nÉirinn é ach deireann na stairithe gurb é an ceann is seanda agus is ársa san Euroip féin é.  Tá sé an-deacair ag cuairteoirí cúirt a thabhairt ar Dhún Aengus&mdash;sin i dturas lae&mdash;agus téann cuid mhaith de na daoine isteach go Arainn ar turas lae.

Bhíodh na lads óga ar thóir na gcoiníní&mdash;ba é sin sul dá rabh &ldquo;myxomatosis&rdquo; orthu&mdash;ach ar aon chaoi leagadh cuid mhaith de na chlocháin a bhí ann.  Tá mé ag ceapadh gur &ldquo;beehive houses&rdquo; an Béarla atá orthu.  Bhí cuid mhaith acu ann.  Ní dóigh liom anois go bhfuil fágtha ach aon cheann amháin.  Rinneadh an millteanas san, ní de bharr an mhillteanais féin. Cuireann sé sin ag tagairt mé do rud a dúirt an Teachta Mac Giolla Bhride nár cheart aon ath-tógáil nó deisiú a dhéanamh ar na rudaí seo.  Is é mo thuairm féin gur sin sompla gur mb'fhéidir gur ceart do Choimisinéirí na n-Oibreacha Poiblí machnamh a dhéanamh ar cheist so na h-ath-tógála. Tá na clocháin loitithe ag na lads óga. Tá mé ag ceapadh gur fearr iad do chur le chéile arís san áit a raibh siad.  Is <Col N="329" /> mó an chontúirt go ndéanfaí millteanas nuair bhionn áit iargcúlta i gceist.  Dá mbeadh bóthar ag dul isteach ann agus daoine ag dul isteach ann gach lá laghdófaí an chontúirt go ndéanfaí millteanas. Dá gceapaidís go mbeadh daoine ag teacht ar rothair nó i gcar-ranna, nó fiú amháin ag siúl, bheadh daoine den tsórt sin san airdeall gan scrios no lot a dhéanamh.

      <P>As most Deputies appreciated and stated, the real trouble in respect of doing as much as one would like with regard to national monuments is one of money.  There are many things in this sphere and in many other spheres that we would all like to do, but we come up pretty often and pretty soon against the difficult task of providing the funds to do what we would wish.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Moylan was right when he said in the beginning that there had been a certain amount of apprehension in 1930 that the preservation of our monuments would mean some interference with individual rights and that as the years had worn on it was found that that apprehension was entirely without foundation.  There may be very odd individual cases where there are some slight hardships to the individual, but they are very few and far between and cannot be set off against the benefit that accrues from the preservation that was commenced in 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like very much to underline what was said by Deputy MacBride as to the amount that can be done by local interests.  There is, I am afraid, not merely in respect of our national monuments but in respect of almost every aspect of our life here, too much of the tendency to look to some other fellow to do something for us.  There is far too great a tendency to look to the Government of the day or to look even to the county council of the particular area or to look to anybody other than <Col N="330" /> ourselves.  It would be much better if local people could be interested in keeping in good order the local national monuments that might be in their parish.  In the first place, they would have a much greater pride in them as they belonged more especially to them. They would have a monetary interest also, as if they were well kept that would tend to bring tourists to the parish and to bring business to the area.</P>
    <P>I hope that, whatever is done in the future, the tendency will be to bring the local people more into what is being done and to assist them in doing things, rather than that there should be a continuous approach from below to above, to get the people at the top to do something that those in the locality will not come together and do themselves.  It is not merely in our monuments that that viewpoint has crept into our life: it is in everything, and it would be a very good thing indeed if the tendency were reversed.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is in preparation a book, a brochure or a list of our monuments which will to some extent meet the need referred to by Deputy Doyle and others.  There is also need to co-ordinate the work that is done in this respect by the Commissioners of Public Works, with the work done by Fógra Fáilte in regard to tourist literature. I am afraid there has been a tendency in past years for bodies charged with a particular type of work to go along the line of that work, without any effort to co-ordinate it with analogous work being done by other bodies.  We find, for example, in other spheres work that was being done by the Tourist Board was at the same time being paralleled in other Departments of the State which were doing work that was practically identical.  It would be very bad indeed if anything the Commissioners of Public Works might do under this Bill or under the parent Act, in producing a book or brochure about national monuments, should not be done in such a way as to tie in with our general literature, so that tourists would get what they require in one place in regard to our monuments rather than have to go to two or three places for it.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the view that was put <Col N="331" /> forward by Deputy Cunningham that the Commissioners of Public Works are a lower order of things than Bord Fáilte.  The Deputy was a little bit unkind to the commissioners when he suggested that.  Perhaps he did not mean the suggestion quite in that way.</P>

      <P>This is really an enabling Bill.  It is a Bill to ease out some of the difficulties that have been found in practice over the years since the original Act was passed in 1930.  I think it will ease out some of those difficulties, but it will only ease them out.  In the last analysis, whether a national monument is preserved and whether its approaches are such as would be conducive to what we would wish, will ultimately depend on the interest local people show in that monument and in its preservation.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies thought that not nearly enough had been done.  People often take that line in regard to various aspects of our national life.  I am inclined to take the other line, that considering we have only had our freedom and our own Government institutions for 25 years we have done a great deal.  We ought to be proud of the progress we have made, while at the same time hoping to make greater progress in the future.</P>

Frequently in this House, and particularly during the last emergency, I have had to call attention to the scandalous example given by the manner in which the State was handling these lands.  The State had compulsory powers to compel every farmer to till his holding but hundreds of acres of these lands were untilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember that last year I raised a question in regard to a particular estate&mdash;the estate at Moorpark, Kilworth.  He came in at the time.  I am glad to see that he is now finishing the job he said was delayed so long at that period.  I want to know from the Minister how long, in his opinion, it will take before the lands at Moorpark are handed over to the Land Commission for division.  Has the Minister any intentions of dealing with the Curragh on the same lines? These are matters that concern us all. You had over 450 acres in the Moorpark estate&mdash;450 acres of arable land which was used only for grazing.  It is the best of tillage land.  I am sure the people of that district would feel far happier if they could see that land <Col N="335" /> divided up and the uneconomic holders in the district getting portions of it. What I would be anxious to hear from the Minister is the length of time he thinks it will now take before his Department will hand this land over to the Land Commission for division. There are also some thousands of acres in the Kilworth area which could be handed over without any loss to anybody and which at present are practically derelict.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how long he thinks it will take.</P>

      <P>It would be dangerous for me to offer any definite estimate to Deputy Corry as to how long the disposal would take.  The only thing I can say is that I hope it will not take as long as this Bill.  Consideration of some such measure was, I believe, first started in or around the year 1927 when the present Taoiseach was Attorney-General.  It will not take as long as this Bill took.</P>

      <P>The Moorpark estate to which the Deputy referred was one of the properties the disposal of which was held up pending this Bill. When this Bill has been enacted we will be able to give active attention to it and with such a speed, I hope, in the various Departments that will be responsible that will astound even the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am a little bit apprehensive of Deputy Corry's query about the Curragh.  Is it that Deputy Corry wishes to transfer from the East Cork constituency to Kildare?  I trust that is not so.  The Curragh is dealt with under a special Act of 1870 and there are certain private rights on it, as apart from State lands, which require very careful consideration.</P>

      <P>On the Resolution, I have already indicated that I regard this Bill as a typical instance of bureaucratic control which I think is undesirable in legislation.  I can quite well appreciate that the Minister requires some form of Exchange Control Bill and that the Minister is in the dilemma of deciding whether he should continue the existing Emergency Powers Order or introduce a Bill to cover the position for a longer period.  I accept the Minister's view that he regards these powers as necessary. Nevertheless, I consider that the Bill is a very bad precedent and a dangerous precedent from a legislative point of view, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it from another point of view.  I think the constitutionality of the Bill is doubtful.  The measure, in effect, gives fairly wide powers, amounting to powers of confiscation, and I doubt if the provisions of a Bill that, in effect, provide for confiscation are constitutional.</P>

Possibly the majority of citizens who read Section 10 <Col N="337" /> will be better able to understand it than I can, but certainly I cannot understand this provision which says: &ldquo;except with the permission of the Minister, a person shall not issue any bearer certificate&rdquo;&mdash;I will pass over the next qualifying words&mdash;&ldquo;... that it becomes a bearer certificate or coupon&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  Has it any meaning or what is it intended to cover?  Certainly, as it stands, it is meaningless.

      <P>To delete sub-section (4), lines 32 to 34.</P>
      <P>This particular section as it stands at the moment forbids in effect any person from detaching a coupon from a certificate of title of securities otherwise than in the normal course for collection.  I take it the intention was to apply this only to &ldquo;reserved securities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily at all.  It could and must refer to other bearer certificates as well.  Might I interrupt the Deputy for a second?  A coupon is exactly the same certificate as a bearer bond.  The purpose of sub-section (4), when I was talking to the Deputy privately I had not turned up my note on it, is to ensure that you cannot make the coupons into, so to speak, a separate bearer security as <Col N="339" /> you could otherwise.  Without that sub-section you could cut off all the coupons for the next ten years.  Those coupons would be negotiable <i>per se</i> and without the production of the certificate itself.  Therefore, unless you had the restriction that is there you would permit negotiation of the coupon away from the certificate of title.  That would mean that you would be able in that way to remove substantial funds from the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The one I said. Suppose you had not got that sub-section you could cut off coupons for ten years ahead.  You could post those coupons to a non-sterling area, for example, and they could be cashed there even though the certificate was held here in accordance with the Act. If you did not bind people to keep the coupons with the certificate, then the coupons themselves could be sent abroad for negotiation, and we would lose the currency in question as a result.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), sub-paragraph (ii), lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;satisfactory in the national interest&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 17 casts what I regard as a political function on the Revenue Commissioners, the function of determining what is in the national interest.  I think it is a very dangerous precedent. It is a tendency which has been showing itself in certain recent legislation. The question of the determination of what is in the national interest is not part of the function of the Revenue Commissioners or, indeed, of anybody other than the Government and this House.  I appreciate fully that any person aggrieved has a right of appeal to the Minister, who can override the views of the Revenue Commissioners as to what is in the national interest or what is not in the national interest. I think it is a dangerous and bad tendency and I, therefore, put down an amendment to provide that instead of placing the onus on the Revenue Commissioners of determining what is in the national interest the section will merely place the onus on the Revenue Commissioners of determining whether the price obtained for exports in this case is adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the Deputy took the line in respect of this section that it was setting up a body that was superior to this House and to the Minister.  I am glad he appreciates that is not the position. I think the Deputy's very amendment makes it clear that it is only a question of the form of words rather than the type of argument that he used on the last day.  I have not any objection to accepting the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in place of the words &ldquo;satisfactory in the national interest&rdquo; if the Deputy feels very strongly about it.  The word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; would be narrower in the particular context than the other form of words we have used.  We wanted to use the widest form of words that we could find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the words, &ldquo;satisfactory in the national interest&rdquo;, if construed from one point of view, would be quite satisfactory but they would, perhaps, lend themselves to the objection that <Col N="341" /> they might be misconstrued by other people as giving to the Revenue Commissioners a function which it was not intended to give but which, of course, they could not be given.  If the Deputy would rather have the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in the two paragraphs (a) and (b) of the sub-section I am quite prepared to accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride raised a point on Section 26, on the Second Reading, and he has put down an amendment. The amendment which I have tabled, however, goes even further than that which he had in mind.  I said on the last occasion&mdash;and I still feel&mdash;that in so far as this particular section is concerned the amendment is not necessary <i>per se</i>.  This section refers solely to authorised dealers and authorised depositories and also to persons to whom the powers of the Minister under this Bill are delegated, that is to say, civil servants and people to whom powers are given under this Bill.  I think, so far as those classes of persons are concerned, it would be unnecessary to make the amendment.  Deputy MacBride, on the last occasion did, however, make the point that it was a dangerous precedent to allow this to be included in case it might be transferred by some other person in the future as a precedent to some other Bill.  I think that point of view has force, and as it is not absolutely necessary to keep the powers contained in the sub-section (5), I am moving the deletion of everything after the words &ldquo;served on him&rdquo;.  In other words, we propose to rely purely on directions that we should give and serve, and having regard to the limited type of persons to whom this section is directed we will be able to keep that type of direction there and there will not be any danger, after we have deleted the lines indicated, of this being used as a precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which enables the Minister to delegate or authorise the delegation of any of his powers other than the power of making a Statutory Order to any other person.  Again, on the question of constitutional practice, I doubt whether a section of that kind is desirable.  The Minister is appointed by this House to carry out his functions as Minister.  It is true as we know that the actual departmental work is carried on by the officials of his Department but he is primarily responsible.  He is appointed by this House to discharge such responsibilities and be accountable to this House for it.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered whether this is absolutely necessary.  Actually in practice he will delegate his powers &mdash;at least he will not delegate powers but his duties of examining certain things&mdash;to officials but I do not think he can divest himself of his duties when he is responsible to the House by a general delegation of his functions to officials.</P>
      <P>I must say that I was rather amused at the only power he does not delegate, namely the power of making an Order which has to be laid on the Table of this House.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that section and see if it is really necessary.  Again, it is a dangerous legislative precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that there is a very old principle of law that the principal is responsible for the work of his agent and there is a vast difference between delegation and divesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not divesting myself of powers. <Col N="344" /> I am saying that I can authorise somebody else to carry them out, but if they carry them out in a manner the Deputy thinks is reprehensible I am the unfortunate person who has the responsibility of accounting for the manner in which those powers are executed.  I have no doubt that if anyone to whom any of these powers were delegated behaved in an unduly bureaucratic manner, shall we say, that the Deputy would be the first person&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to call me to account as the principal who is responsible for the work of his agent.  We all know in modern times that no principal in any business does everything himself.  He has to get his subordinate to do the work for him.  We all know that no Minister, not even the Minister for Finance, sees everything that happens and there are many things that are done in accordance with his general policy that are done by individual civil servants.</P>
    <P>The working of exchange control is a very detailed thing that is carried out in a detailed manner according to certain fixed general principles.  This is to enable detailed work to be done. For example, there are certain things that must be done by banks, as apart from civil servants and I think the Deputy will agree that it would be undesirable to have two parallel institutions doing the same thing.  The banks were given certain powers and functions during the emergency&mdash;to handle certain small currency allocations for example&mdash;and they still have those functions.  They merely have to report back so that it would not be necessary to clutter up the Department of Finance every time anyone came in to get a travel allowance within the broad principles of general travel allowances that have been laid down by the Minister.  As the Deputy knows, there is a maximum amount of foreign currency that you can get for foreign travel in any one year.  Within that maximum allocation the duty of arranging for that currency is delegated by the Minister of the day to the banks so as to save the administrative machinery in the Department from being cluttered up unnecessarily.  It is in order to permit that to be done that we have this provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite a usual line for the Department of Finance to take if it is going to bind other Departments, but it is a matter of some doubt as to whether the State is bound by statute or not.  We think it desirable to put the section in so as <Col N="346" /> to cover not merely Government Departments but also perhaps semi-State bodies such as Grain Importers, Limited, and so forth.  Grain Importers, Limited, particularly spend very substantial sums abroad and there is another State organisation which covenanted to spend a substantial sum abroad and it would obviously be desirable that these should all fall within the general picture and pattern of exchange control, so that we might know what foreign exchange we have available and how we are to allocate it in a time of great stress.</P>

      <P>It is not that the Department of Finance is trying to get any further power.

      <P>I again want to repeat that I think a measure of this kind is a dangerous legislative precedent. In my view, it is a Bill which has the effect of extending bureaucratic control.  Its purpose is to give wider powers on a longer term basis to the dominion which the Department of Finance exercises on all financial matters and also apparently to extend the tentacles of the Department in relation to other Government Departments.  I must say that if I had been a member of the Government when this Bill came before it, I would have eyed it with a considerable amount of suspicion.  I think it is a dangerous precedent and, as I have indicated to the Minister, the powers, in effect, of confiscation which it confers are hardly constitutional. However, that is a matter for the Minister and for the law advisers to the Government, but I should not be surprised if, at some future stage, the Minister finds himself in difficulties if he acts too stringently on foot of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (b), lines 25 to 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reasons for doing so are that, for the past 20 years, there has been an organisation&mdash;a private company&mdash; which has handled very effectively a nursing service in Dublin and all over <Col N="348" /> this country.  It became a limited liability company a few years ago, and has carried on to the very great satisfaction of all the people who had to do with it.  It has employed a large number of people.  It has a panel of approximately 60 State-registered nurses, and the women and the men whom they employ, too, have given the very greatest satisfaction wherever they have been called upon to help the sick and injured.</P>
    <P>They have maintained this service at all hours of the day: in fact, they are running a 24-hour service, and the total calls which they answer average over 4,000 per annum.  They also have worked very closely with Aer Lingus in the transport of invalids, and this has become an established feature of their work, and of the work of Aer Lingus.  They have done this work, as I said before, to the very great satisfaction of all concerned&mdash;and they are a private concern.  They have carried on this work in the teeth of the usual competition which a service like this would have to contend with.  This society now comes along, I am sure, with the very best motives, but nevertheless the activities of this Red Cross Society are bound to affect the private enterprise which has carried on so well up to date.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that this company in 1945 felt obliged to seek an injunction against the Irish Red Cross Society when they endeavoured to extend their operations on the lines indicated in the Bill.  They succeeded in getting a perpetual injunction against the society in the High Court. I think we here should consider very carefully before we set aside, as we shall be doing in this Bill, the action of the High Court which went into the matter very thoroughly.  These are briefly the reasons why I propose this amendment.  We should be guilty of a very wrong act if we gave the society authority to provide these services which would, in fact, be the ruin of a very fine service run by private enterprise. Something that we do not like to do here is to crush an individual company or any individual with the aid of State money.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Dockrell was not here on the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill.  I raised the matter at that stage, not because I believed that the particular section which would give this power would be abused, but merely in order to secure an assurance from the Minister that in no circumstances would the Red Cross Society go into competition with private enterprise. We got that assurance.  A member of the Red Cross Society in this House spoke on the subject and I think the Minister endorsed everything that Deputy said.  So far as I can read the Bill, I think the question as a whole is fully covered by Section 6.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that Section 6 gives ample assurance as far as going into competition with private enterprise is concerned.  I can endorse what Deputy Dockrell has said in respect to the services which some private enterprises of this kind have given in the past and will, I am sure, continue to give in future.  It is because I was aware of such services that I raised the matter on the Second Stage. I am taking it, anyway, that the Minister is not accepting the amendment in view of the assurances which were given on the occasion of the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy meant what he said very sincerely, but I would not agree at all that Section 6 safeguards private enterprise in this connection.  Section 5 authorises the society to engage in any activities of a humanitarian character which it considers suitable.  Then the section goes on to mention two particular types of activity in which it does authorise the society to engage, namely, to carry on a preventorium and to provide an ambulance service.  In Section 6 the Minister is given an over-all power of direction, and I suppose he could possibly veto one of these services.  Then the argument would be: &ldquo;Well, if he is given the power of veto, why did Section 5 specifically say that an ambulance service should be carried on?&rdquo;  I think the Minister would be bound to agree to the setting up of an ambulance service if you read paragraph (b) of <Col N="350" /> Section 5 of the Bill.  I do not think that Section 6 would give him any more power than just to regulate it.</P>

      <P>I would commend the Deputy to read the report of the Second Reading debate.  I presume he did not read the report because there was an obvious case given in which an ambulance service might be required. The particular case given, so far as I was concerned, did not come into conflict with private enterprise.  From that point of view I was myself perfectly satisfied with the assurances given here by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It does appear that there is much substance in what Deputy Dockrell has said, that having established the right the Minister will be put in a rather difficult position to prevent the society operating for reward on a commercial basis.  I do not think that I could accept the amendment in its present form, because if I were to do so, I would have to go further.  Sub-section (1) of Section 5 authorises the society to engage in any activity and at its discretion to make charges in connection with engaging in any such activity.  It is somewhat contradictory, I admit.</P>
      <P>I think that this amendment was submitted rather hastily and I had not time to give it the full examination I should like to give it.  Although I think Section 6 gives the Minister power to honour the bond he gave here that he would not allow the Red Cross to enter into competition with any private concern, I do not think it is sufficiently clear.  The amendment, however, as it stands, would not cover the object the Deputy has in view.  I would suggest that the section should be left over until the Report Stage and if I feel it is necessary, I can then amend it.</P>

      <P>What I am undertaking is to examine the matter, to see <Col N="351" /> exactly how I can make sure that I shall honour the bond that I would not allow the society to enter into unfair competition with private enterprise. I want to say in passing that there are other organisations such as the Knights of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade and that they are allowed to charge.  The only difference between them and the Red Cross is that they do not get a State subsidy and the Red Cross does.  The case I made was that under the Act setting up the Red Cross there was no permission given to them to charge.  It was not on any other ground.  The decision of the court was that this authority was not given to them in the Act.</P>

      <P>I suppose I must bow to the Minister in this matter, but I still think that the only way in which to be perfectly fair to the interests which are not in receipt of Government funds is by not giving the Red Cross that particular power.  I think this is the only way in which that can be done because otherwise it will be left open to the Minister to change his mind at any time.  If the Minister does not propose to permit the Red Cross to engage in an ambulance service&mdash;under Section 6, he envisages himself as not permitting that society to engage in such a service&mdash;I am afraid the society will put up a very good case, under Section 5, asking why on earth they should be authorised to engage in such a service and directly encouraged under the Bill?</P>

      <P>I was satisfied that the case cited was so far removed <Col N="352" /> from an urban or suburban area in which a private ambulance service might be organised that it was hardly likely there would be an ambulance service; in fact, there would not be such organisations as the Knights of Malta or the St. John Ambulance Brigade and, therefore, the Red Cross Society, which is so far-flung throughout the State, would be the only likely source from which such a service could be obtained.  In that light, having heard the debate, I was fully satisfied that the Minister should have this power.  I think Section 6 fully guarantees and assures to Deputies that there will not be competition as between the Red Cross and private enterprise.  In the interests of people living in the remote areas, I think this power should be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the failure to secure an adequate market abroad for Irish whiskey under present production conditions and the necessity for safeguarding our national economy by building up our export trade, particularly in hard currency areas, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that steps should be taken, if necessary by the setting up of a State-sponsored company, to produce a suitably <Col N="353" /> blended whiskey; Dáil Éireann further considers that these steps should be taken at once in view of the very beneficial effect that the increased barley production would have on agriculture and the extra employment that would be afforded generally.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tabled a motion in connection with proposals for expanding our distilling industry and that motion is worded in such a way as to give an opportunity to the Minister to take the necessary steps to expand the industry, though not necessarily on the lines suggested in the motion itself.  I have pointed out that steps should be taken to set up a State-sponsored company to produce a suitably blended whiskey and it is a matter for the Minister and his Department to decide whether or not it is essential that such a State-sponsored company should be established.</P>
    <P>In the course of my remarks I propose to give my reasons as to why I consider it essential to set up this State-sponsored company in order to bring about the expansion that is so necessary.  If the Minister is in a position to suggest a sound alternative, then I am prepared to listen to reason.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many Deputies who have not the vaguest idea of the distilling industry in general.  Most of them have a knowledge of the different types of whiskey available, but I am sure if they were asked about distillation and the different types that are produced&mdash;patent, grain or potstill&mdash;they would not be able to tell the difference between any of them. If the distillers were doing their duty to the State, there would be no need for me to table this motion and Deputies would not have to suffer here listening to the reasons I propose to give as to why we should take the steps outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally admitted that the distilling industry could be of tremendous importance to the nation in the economic sphere and in the returns gained by an expansion of the trade abroad, particularly in the hard currency areas.  It is realised publicly <Col N="354" /> that the whiskey industry, if properly developed, could be a very important industrial arm of our agricultural economy.  Although that is generally believed and agreed upon by the public and by those who represent the public, Deputies and Parties, no concrete steps have been taken in the last few years to ensure this necessary expansion. I have heard in the House on a number of occassions Deputies for whom I have a great deal of respect putting up a very sound defence for the actions of the distillers in regard to this important industry.  All I want to say at this stage is that I am convinced&mdash;and I have enough evidence to prove that I am correct&mdash;that these Deputies, although acting in all sincerity, were misled and misguided in their attempts to back up the case made by the distillers.</P>
    <P>I believe that for the last 70 years our distillers have been prepared to jog along, that they have been satisfied with the home market.  Their cry is and has been that their product is the best whiskey in the world.  While they adopt this line and live in this cuckoo-land, the Scotch have swept the decks with their blended products. To-day, the Irish distillers strongly oppose the introduction of a blended product, just as they opposed it 70 years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to weary the House, but there are volumes of evidence available for any Deputy who wishes to check the remarks I have to make with regard to the hostility shown by the Irish distillers in the last 70 years towards the production in Ireland of a blended whiskey.  I propose, however, to make certain evidence available and to produce references so that any Deputy who is interested may check them.  I propose to prove that back to the year 1874 the Irish distillers used every means in their power to prevent a patent whiskey from even being described as whiskey.</P>
    <P>In 1908 the Irish pot-still distillers and a number of distillers in England and Scotland brought such pressure to bear that the British Government at the time set up a Royal Commission to inquire into whether what was known as a patent whiskey was entitled <Col N="355" /> by law to be described as such.  That Royal Commission sat for a considerable period in 1908 and took volumes of evidence from trade associations, farmers, producers of patent whiskey, the Irish distillers, who were so keen on the pot still and, at the end of a long session, they issued a very valuable report which I will deal with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to read that report and to see the evidence given by prominent Irish distillers, when asked their views in 1908, about the merits of blended products.  In this report one of the proprietors of what is known as Powers to-day, Mr. James Talbot Power, who was described in the report as the chairman and principal proprietor of Sir John Power &amp; Sons, was questioned with regard to his idea of what whiskey was.  He was asked for a definition and he said: &ldquo;I am satisfied that whiskey cannot be produced except in a pot still.&rdquo;  He went on to say that Irish whiskey should be confined as a trade description to pot-still whiskey.  He went further and said: &ldquo;In my opinion it is a definite fraud to sell as whiskey patent spirit with a small addition of pot still.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputies who do not understand the difference between a patent whiskey and pot still let me say that Scotch whiskeys to-day are a blend of pot still and patent, the ranges of the blend varying from 60 per cent. patent and 40 per cent. pot still.  Some of the Scotch whiskeys are 80 per cent. patent and 20 per cent. pot still.  That was the type of whiskey described by James Talbot Power, in 1908, when he said that it was a definite fraud to sell as whiskey patent spirit with a small addition of pot still.  He went on to criticise the Revenue Commissioners for allowing this to happen.</P>
    <P>He was supported in his evidence by Mr. Andrew Jameson who was described as managing director of that distillery.  Mr. Jameson was questioned by the chairman as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did Jameson, in conjunction with three other Dublin distillers, issue a pamphlet in 1876, and another in 1878, calling attention to the use of <Col N="356" /> blended patent still by blenders of Irish whiskey and denouncing this blending as a fraud on the public?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply of Mr. Jameson was: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He was further questioned:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your firm has consistently opposed the sale of Irish whiskey containing any product of a patent still?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His reply was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We always have done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was 1908 and that is the position in 1954.  Anyone who still has doubts about the feelings of the Irish distillers towards the blended product would find it beneficial to consult Hansard in the year 1876 because the matter was then raised repeatedly in the British House of Commons by the Irish members.  Naturally, the Irish members acted in all sincerity but they were prompted and advised by the Irish distillers.  I do not propose to go into that in any detail.  I will just refer to one particular matter that took place in the British House of Commons.  On 5th April, 1876, there was a discussion on a motion in the House of Commons which was put forward by W.H. O'Sullivan, an Irish member.  The argument put forward by Mr. O'Sullivan was that the practice of blending between pot still and patent was a fraud and should not be permitted.  Mr. O'Sullivan petitioned for a Committee of the House of Commons to inquire into the matter. His motion was defeated by 149 votes to 69.  The interesting part of that debate was that one of the speakers against the motion, naturally enough, was a Scotsman, a Mr. Anderson, from Glasgow.  I am afraid he fairly tore the Irish members asunder in that debate.  He said that the whole object of the motion was &ldquo;an attempt on the part of the Irish distillers, who found that their trade had been slipping away, to get it back again.  They found they could not get the extravagant prices which they used to get years ago for it had been discovered that malted spirit could be made by another process and at a considerably lower price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> I had better point out that the other process that was available for the making of the malted spirit, known as the Coffey process, was an invention by an Irishman named Coffey.  It was able to do in one operation what takes three operations in the pot-still work.  When Coffey's invention was brought before the Irish distillers they pooh-poohed the idea and would not accept it, but to our misfortune Mr. Coffey went to Scotland and put his idea before the Scotch distillers.  They adopted the Coffey method of distillation, with the result to-day that we have the Scotch sweeping the market.</P>
    <P>It would be only fair to go back again to Mr. Andrew Jameson in his evidence before the Royal Commission.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For as long as I remember and before that, the expense of making whiskey in the pot still has always been held up to us as a mistake on our part.  Many persons have come to us and tried to show us how to make our pot-still whiskey cheaper and eventually when the Coffey still was discovered they discovered a cheap method of making the article which, as we know, can be mixed up with the pot-still whiskey and that produces a cheaper product.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Jameson was well aware, as you can see from that evidence, of the tremendous importance that was being attached to this new method of distillation invented by Mr. Coffey.  Even so, the distillers in 1908 were prepared to say: &ldquo;We know what is best and we do not approve of this idea of allowing a blended product on the market.&rdquo;  Mr. Jameson was questioned again as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever may be the result, Mr. Jameson, you would not allow the patent still whiskey to be sold as whiskey at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Jameson said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will give you an idea of the mentality of our distillers up to 1908. Perhaps at this stage I should mention that when the Irish distillers were asked for a definition of Irish whiskey, <Col N="358" /> the following answer was given by all the distillers in Ireland:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irish whiskey is a spirit distilled in a pot still which should go through at least two or three distillations and is made from a mash that comes from cereals grown in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen from that that the impression is given by the distillers that the distinctive flavour of Irish whiskey is due in great measure to the fact that its constituent parts are produced in Ireland.  In the course of the evidence given by other people before this commission, they go to grave pains to emphasise that the flavour that was given to Irish whiskey was in great part due to the fact that the constituents of that whiskey were grown in Ireland.  A very prominent man gave evidence before the commission, not on behalf of the distillers but on behalf of the farming community. I refer to Sir Horace Plunkett. His evidence before the commission is well worth having on the records of this House.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Speaking of barley, it happens to be one of the crops we grow best and if anything was done to discourage Irish barley growers it would have serious effects on the whole agricultural economy of Ireland.  I may say that while I was in the Department of Agriculture all my advisers were agreed that we ought to pay special attention to what we call the industrial crops, the most important being barley.  We conducted a large number of experiments in the cultivation of barley all over Ireland in conjunction with Guinness's Brewery and some of the distillers.  We kept a special expert to deal with that crop alone and these experiments are still being continued.  This action was not taken in the interest of the whiskey trade, but it so happened that this crop had a very important bearing upon the whole of our agricultural economy and it would have very disastrous results if anything were done at a time when it is most important to increase the area under tillage, if the lands that are now growing barley were largely to go back to grass.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can see Sir Horace Plunkett's idea <Col N="359" /> was that barley was the main constituent for the making of whiskey, and he was anxious to see that no harm would be done to the distilling industry, because if harm were done the agricultural angle of the business, the production of malting barley, would suffer and the farmers of Ireland would suffer as a consequence.  The distillers went to great pains to run down the patent whiskey on the grounds that the patent whiskey was being produced from maize.  Their evidence at the time was that there was harm being done to the farmers of Ireland if blended whiskey were allowed on the market, that this patent and blended whiskey was being produced from constituents not grown in the country, and that maize was the main constituent of the patent whiskey.  It was a very clever approach to have a man with the intelligence and knowledge of Sir Horace Plunkett giving evidence before the commission on the importance of the barley industry in the agricultural economy here.  Sir Horace Plunkett in his evidence on behalf of the barley growers showed that he was under the impression all through that the raw material for the making of patent whiskey came from abroad.  In other words, the impression that Sir Horace Plunkett had was that maize was the main constituent of the patent whiskey.  As far as the making of patent whiskey is concerned, it is made to-day and always has been made&mdash;to a great extent made in Scotland&mdash;from the same constituents as the pot-still whiskey.  At times maize was used in it, depending of course on the price in comparison to barley.  At the present time there is no reason whatever for using maize, because Irish barley can produce the patent whiskey and is equally as good for the patent whiskey as it is for the pot still.  It is interesting to see how worried at the time the distillers showed themselves about the agricultural picture.</P>
    <P>Later on in their evidence, at a later stage before this commission, the distillers forgot their former definition of Irish whiskey.  One of the members of the commission questioned Mr. Jameson.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" />&ldquo;Mr. Jameson, you say that your firm uses materials of the best native quality which money can buy.  Does that mean grain grown exclusively in Ireland?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Jameson's reply to the question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No, it does not.  We use Scotch barley and English barley.  I do not think we have used Scotch oats but rye is a very difficult thing to buy nowadays grown in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, we have the distillers admitting that they themselves did not depend entirely on the home-grown barley for the production of pot-still whiskey although they described Irish pot-still whiskey's flavour as being derived from the home-produced cereals.  Yet, all through the years, we know that they were importing large quantities of foreign barley, oats and rye for the manufacture of Irish pot-still whiskey.</P>
    <P>Some people may not think it is necessary to go back this far but I think, in view of the importance of the matter under discussion and the tremendous opposition that is put forward by the distillers, it is necessary for the members of this House to realise how the growth of the distilling industry took place in Scotland and how we in Ireland gradually faded out of the picture.</P>
    <P>The evidence that was taken by this Royal Commission was sifted and decisions were then made.  I think the recommendations made by that commission in 1908 are just as important to-day as they were in that particular year.  One of the findings of the commission was that the pronounced flavour of each individual whiskey suits the taste of a comparatively limited number of consumers whereas the blended whiskey, especially in England, appeals to a larger number.  &ldquo;Individual whiskey&rdquo; means individual pot-still whiskey and, in 1908, the report was that only a limited number of people favoured that particular type of whiskey.</P>
    <P>Another finding was that blending with patent still whiskey cheapens production because the patent still whiskey costs less to manufacture than the pot still.  That is reasonable.  &ldquo;The <Col N="361" /> blend, therefore, produces a more mildly-flavoured and generally cheaper article than the individual pot-still whiskey.  The market for blended whiskeys is greater than that for individual whiskeys, so much so that it would probably be safe to say that the majority of Englishmen who drink whiskey seldom drink anything but a blend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further report which they issued at that time states: &ldquo;The proportion of the different whiskeys to be employed in blending is controlled by an influence stronger than that of the law.  The taste of the consumer creates the demand which ultimately controls the trade.&rdquo;  They go on to say: &ldquo;The public purchase the whiskey that meets its taste.&rdquo;  Is that not proof enough that, in the past 48 to 50 years, the public taste&mdash;and I am referring to the public taste outside the limited market available in Ireland&mdash;is in favour of a milder type of whiskey, a blended whiskey?  In spite of that fact, our distillers have made no effort whatever to meet that trade.</P>
    <P>It must be evident from the remarks I have made and the evidence that is available that, even in 1908, the blended whiskey was going to be the successful product.  Even then, it was felt that pot-still whiskey, by itself, was a bit too strongly-flavoured for most people, especially those in indoor sedentary occupations, and that the demand for something milder in flavour and more suitable to the conditions of life at that time could best be met by the blended products.  Despite all the evidence available and all the good, sound business reasons that existed, the Irish distillers stubbornly and pig-headedly refused to adapt themselves to changing world tastes and conditions with the consequent disastrous results we have to-day so far as the Irish product is concerned.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to give a contrast between the position in Ireland and the position in Scotland at the present time.  In the first nine months of 1954, the export of Scotch whiskey was worth over £28,000,000, and the value of Irish whiskey exported in the same period&mdash;the first nine months of this year&mdash;was £150,000.  In the distilling <Col N="362" /> season of 1906-7 there were 27 distilleries working in Ireland.  This season, we shall probably be lucky to have five&mdash;and the five working in Ireland will be working only on a limited basis.  It may possibly be the last time that one or two of these distilleries will function as such, unless changes are made.</P>
    <P>While the position in Ireland shows a reduction from 27 flourishing distilleries in 1906 to five, working on a limited basis, in 1954, what is the picture in regard to Scotland?  I have here some of the magazines which deal with the trade in Scotland at the moment.  Listen to what <i>Harpers Wine and Spirit Gazette</i> states: &ldquo;There is a complete absence of pessimism at the Scotch distilleries, whose new season coincided with the beginning of this month.  Fat filling orders indicate that bonders, and indeed all sections of the trade, expect further expansion in the world-demand for Scotch.  The dread spectre of recession is not allowed to haunt the Highland glens and bens these days. Everywhere an air of optimism is in evidence, coupled with a determination to see the customer satisfied&mdash;even if the stills have to work into the summer to do so.  Despite the labour famine, the distilleries are going full out three shifts a day.&rdquo;  That is the position in Scotland: why the reverse in Ireland?</P>
    <P>Would it not be wonderful if we could have here in Ireland employment on work available in Scotland at the present time in the distilling industry? I want to emphasise this point.  So important, indeed, has the distilling industry become in Britain that, last year, Scotch whiskey was actually the largest single dollar earner of any of the industries in Britain.</P>
    <P>We hear talk from the distillers at the present time to the effect that they are going all-out to sell their products abroad.  That type of talk may fool the public for a limited period but I think it is necessary for us to show that it is merely talk and that the facts are otherwise.  In 1952 the total value of Irish whiskey exported was a little under £500,000 for that year. Scotch whiskey exports in the same year were worth £30,000,000.  In 1953, our exports of whiskey dropped from <Col N="363" /> the £500,000 mark to less than £300,000, that is, a drop of over £200,000 in one year in the value and quantity of the export.  The figures, as I have given them for the first nine months of this year, reveal a disastrous state of affairs as far as our exports are concerned.  We all know that in regard to the export trade in the distilling industry the first six months of the year show the bigger sales in exports and in the later months the export drive tails off.  In the first nine months, as I have said, our export of Irish whiskey was worth £150,000.  That leaves us only three months to go so that this year it would be safe to assume that we would be lucky if we exported whiskey to the total value of £200,000, while it would be safe to assume the Scotch export sales in the same 12 months will be in the region of £40,000,000.</P>
    <P>We had several people here in this country in recent years inquiring into the development of Irish industry and giving us, especially the Americans, the benefit of their advice in technical matters and on the type of industry that they felt would meet with a ready market in America.  The report of the I.B.E.C., which is known as the Industrial Potential of Ireland, made several recommendations with regard to the distilling industry and these recommendations are to be found on pages 47, 60 and 89 of the report.  In the first part on page 47 the American experts say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everything considered this would appear to be one of the most promising fields for export development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, they criticise the activities of Irish distillers as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The methods used in this industry do not lend themselves particularly well to volume output and the product requires a particularly long period for proper ageing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These people were naturally speaking very delicately.  They did not like to tread on people's toes, but anybody with common sense will realise that that statement by the American experts was a kick in the pants to Irish <Col N="364" /> distillers and rightly so.  Further on the report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every effort should be made to find ways of increasing the export market in category&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, the distilling industry</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;since it has proved itself susceptible both to making a substantial contribution to the average of national output and to generating much-needed foreign exchange.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a final item from that report, and I think it is of great importance. They are dealing with export problems in the distilling industry and they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Success in this field, vitally important to Ireland's interest, will depend, too, upon vigorous and determined will on the part of the Irish distillers to learn about and meet foreign market requirements, as to quality, style, specification, sales procedure, delivery guarantees and like matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That report was made, I think, in 1950 and so far we have seen no evidence whatever of its being put into effect by our distillers.  Actually our export sales have decreased year after year in spite of all the admonitions and advice given to those people.  I think it is not unreasonable to state that the distilling industry has steadily lost ground over the last 50 years in Ireland.  From the beginning of this century the world trend has been away from the pure pot-still and down the years the blended products have been winning the consumer steadily.  If we are going to treat this matter seriously in Ireland we will have to tackle the problem on the basis that we give the consumers what they desire, not what we feel they should take or what the distillers feel they should take.  This naturally means that we will have to produce suitable blends of whiskey for the export market and the aim of this motion is to establish a body that would be charged with this responsibility.  Some people may think that this is fantastic but I say with a full sense of responsibility that if the distilling industry were properly developed it would rival our cattle trade in its importance to our economy. <Col N="365" /> That would not and could not happen overnight but within a few short years we could build up an important export trade provided the necessary steps are now taken.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, Scotch whiskey sales on the dollar market netted £38,000,000 last year.  In the same period, Irish whiskey sales brought in less than £300,000.  When we look at the American market we find that the consumption of whiskey in America amounts to over £600,000,000 per annum.  The Scots sold last year £38,000,000 of that market so that their sales only represent less than 5 per cent. of the consumption of whiskey in America.  I am not going to ask any mathematician in this House to make up what percentage the Irish sales were out of that £600,000,000.  It was a negligible fraction of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Surely, with our large Irish population in America, by giving the right commodity, producing the properly blended whiskey that will suit the American palate, we should be able to get a proper footing in that market. If the Scots can do it I do not see any reason why we could not do it.  The tragedy as far as I am concerned is that we have wasted so much valuable time.  By superior business methods, by studying and ministering to the needs of potential customers, by persistent, relentless propaganda of an attractive and artistic nature, the Scot has wiped our eye.</P>
    <P>All sorts of excuses will be put forward by the distillers or by their spokesmen to save their faces.  They will blame this Government and that Government.  They will blame the consumer. They will blame everybody but themselves for the position that obtains at the present time.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, when the distillers began to get hot under the collar at certain criticisms levelled at them&mdash; criticisms which they could no longer afford to disdainfully ignore&mdash;they rushed into print in their own defence. That was a sorry day for them as I will prove before I conclude on this.  I will go back to the year 1953.  In October of that year we had a number of letters published in the daily papers <Col N="366" /> by spokesmen of the distillers.  A Major Kirkwood, secretary of the Distillers' Association, in print in the <i>Irish Times</i> of May the 28th, 1953, stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Far from being apathetic the distillers were working strenously to increase their exports.  One distillery was exporting to about 70 different countries and in most of the countries was advertising its whiskey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to say as regards the United States that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the war the Government restricted exports when there was a golden opportunity, owing to the shortage of whiskey in the States, to procure a wide distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This gentleman, who is the honorary secretary of the Distillers' Association, was backed up in October, 1953, by Commander J. Howe, director of Jamesons.  He made a statement, when questioned, that we were now exporting to 74 countries, many of them in the dollar area.  That is a statement made with the full sense of responsibility by a director of a distillery outfit, and so is the other statement made by the secretary of the Distillers' Association.  They were exporting to 74 countries.  What is the position?</P>
    <P>In 1953, we exported to 39 countries. We never exported to 74 countries at any time.  It would be worth listening to some of the export figures in regard to the 39 countries.  In 1953, we exported to the British West Indies eight gallons of whiskey, four gallons to British Honduras, eight gallons to the Netherlands, two gallons to Switzerland, eight gallons to Italy and 28 gallons to Algeria.  We exported to French Indo-China less than 54 gallons. These are just some of the countries to which we exported whiskey and in which the big drive was taking place according to the sponsored spokesman of the Irish distillers.</P>
    <P>I forgot to mention Australia.  In 1953 our export trade to Australia consisted of one gallon of Irish whiskey.  I have known many Deputies in this House who kept more than that to entertain their friends.  For the first <Col N="367" /> nine months of 1954, we did not export but then to make up for that we exported nine gallons to the Fiji Islands. I am sure it will be a consolation to the Minister to know that.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention all this is because we have it in print from the spokesman of the distillers that we are now exporting to 74 countries many of which are in the dollar area.  I call that a damn lie.  This idea of the American experts, persistent and relentless salesmanship, is not being followed up by the distillers even with regard to their own pot-still whiskey.  Where this country's exports last year ranged from two gallons to 100 gallone this year the figures are down in those countries because they have not followed up the drive that took place for the sale of that limited quantity last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the criticism levelled by the secretary of the Distillers' Association when he points out that the Government restricted exports during the war years when there was a great chance of getting a hold on the American market, I want to say&mdash;I am not defending the action of any Government&mdash;that that statement of the distillers does not hold water when we examine the position prior to the war.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last war, there was a golden opportunity of expanding our sales in America.  I do not know whether many people in this House are aware that in 1934, on the repeal of prohibition in America, the then Irish Minister to the States succeeded in getting a quota for the import of Irish whiskey into America.  The Irish distillers at that time said they could not fulfil the quota as they wanted all their stocks for the home market.  Let me emphasise that the quota obtained by the Irish representative in America in 1934 was a generous one and that that quota was granted to Ireland a month before the Scotch got their quota.</P>
    <P>In spite of that we know the position. There is no use in listening to the distillers' representatives telling us the Government is to blame.  If the distillers go into print and put up an <Col N="368" /> argument we must be in a position to argue with them.  The secretary of the association went on in his remarks in the papers to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would expect our Government to assist rather than handicap the industry as they have done by the crushing weight of taxation imposed on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that is more nonsense on the part of the distillers.  The suggestion is that the poor distillers are overtaxed and cannot afford to compete with the Scotch because the Government is bleeding them with regard to the duties levied on the distilling industry. What is the position?  It is a fact that the spirit duty to-day in Great Britain is much higher than in this country but that did not prevent the Scots from selling £38,000,000 worth of whiskey last year.  If we are going to get a real picture of the minds of the distillers let us read the final remarks of the secretary of the Distillers' Association.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the long run, the industry must depend on the home market as the export market is problematical in those times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was conveyed in that sentence the mentality of the distillers in Ireland from 1870 to 1954.  That shows they are not interested in world markets as long as they are doing all right here in Ireland as distillers.  The export market and Irish agriculture does not worry them.  That sentence of the secretary, I think, sums up the so-called progressive outlook of our distillers, and it is necessary for us in the interests of the people of this country to ensure that they are not let away with that outlook.  I find&mdash;I suppose it is regrettable to have to say it&mdash;that I think this industry, which is one of the most important in the country, can no longer be left solely in the hands of these distillers.  I do not mean that we should take the distilleries over or that we should close down these people, but I think we will have to organise another means of producing the right product for world markets if the distillers are not prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> People will say that this is a dangerous line to travel.  I am sure people inside and outside this House will describe my views on this as extremely dangerous&mdash;I do not care whether they do or not.  I do not care what you call the outlook that I have shown exists, but I believe we must be completely ruthless with the distillers in the interests of our community.  The leaders in this House in private enterprise have always put up the argument that private enterprise is more enterprising than State concerns and that that is the big advantage of private enterprise.  I say when private enterprise shows itself to be lacking, as it shows itself in this industry, that the State must take action.  We have plenty of examples in this country of State and semi-State sponsored concerns showing more initiative and enterprise than any private concern. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the distilling industry from the agricultural point of view.  I think when we have a man with the knowledge of agriculture that Sir Horace Plunkett had, that we should listen to his views and accept them even though these were given 50 years ago.  I see that many prominent people at debating societies are quoting Sir Horace Plunkett as their bible on agriculture, and I think his views on barley growing are such as should meet the approval of this House.  It could be the most important means of expanding industry here, and yet no industrial concern in the country has been subject to the same neglect.  It is beyond contradiction that all the products of the land should be processed to the last degree by Irish workers.  That is, I think, admitted by all.  The distilling industry has as its foundation malting barley, and if there is barley for the maltster there is a rich cash crop for the farmer, constant work and security for the worker; there is whiskey for export and there is a residue to grain to feed the farmers' live stock.  To my mind, the distilling industry is a cycle of industrial perfection.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this motion will commend itself to the Minister but I can assure him that I am not alone in the views I have expressed here <Col N="370" /> regarding the necessity for producing blended whiskey.  I raised this matter of blended whiskey in the House before with particular reference to June, 1953, when on the Adjournment Debate the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Deputy Lemass, intervened and at column 732, Volume 139, of the Official Report, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The predominance of Scotch whiskey in the world export markets did not begin this year or last year, or even during the recent war: it began 50 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did not bother the House as I did by dealing with the reasons why it was so successful since, but he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The world market is for a Scotch type of whiskey.  That is my view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the time the then Minister had hopes that the distillers and Córas Tráchtála between them would hammer out some arrangement by which a blended whiskey would be produced but so far we see no evidence that anything of a satisfactory nature will come of the constant meetings and discussions that take place between the distillers and Córas Tráchtála.  I want the Minister to let us know, if he is not prepared to accept the motion as it stands, what alternative he has to offer; whether in recent months the distillers have again refused point blank to co-operate in the production of a blended whiskey.  We have at the present moment a number of individual distillers&mdash;I am not going to mention them&mdash;who are now, as I would describe it, tinkering with the idea of producing their own blended whiskey and they all want to be backed by the State to sell their particular product abroad.  I know they are planning to produce and I have seen the particular blended whiskey produced by two or three of them and personally I think that although their efforts as individuals should be commended we are not going to get anywhere by having one or two distillers nibbling at the problem. It is going to take a great deal of money to develop markets and anybody with a knowledge of the American market realises that unless you <Col N="371" /> pour money in for advertising you are not going to get sales.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the Scottish distillers spend more money in one year in advertising their products than we get from the entire export of Irish whiskey.  They spend more on advertising their products alone than we draw into our country for the sale of whiskey.  It is essential that the thing be tackled on a large scale and there is no use in individual distillers spending the next five or ten years telling us that they are about to get into the market.</P>
    <P>I will say no more at the moment except that I will be waiting to hear what views the Minister has in connection with the motion itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think at this stage we are likely to gain anything by an examination of the earlier controversies between the Irish pot-still whiskeys and the blended whiskeys, nor would anything good, I think, at this stage come from an attempt to place the responsibility on those who many years ago determined what was the ultimate course of our whiskey production pattern.  I would like to say to Deputy McQuillan, however, that this matter has been given constant attention by the Government for some years past and on many occasions during that period.  In order to show that this matter has been a live issue with the inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951, with the last Government from 1951 to 1954 and has again been actively considered by the present Government, some facts proving that might be of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September, 1949, the Government of that time suggested that this question of expanding our sales in the dollar market should be discussed with the Industrial Development Authority, and they were asked to consider and <Col N="372" /> report on the matter.  The Industrial Development Authority at that time discussed the matter with the Irish pot-still distillers, and explained to them the desire of the Government of the period that our whiskey exports should be expanded; but the attitude adopted by the distillers then was that they were reluctant to expand production in the absence of a guaranteed market.  They explained the difficulties of capital costs of stocks between the date of distillation and the date upon which these stocks reached maturity, but all this discussion produced this main view, as representative of the point of view of the distillers, that, in the main, they were opposed to the proposal which was made to them at that time by the Industrial Development Authority to set up a separate patent still distillery.</P>
    <P>Their attitude was that they wanted to keep to the traditional pattern of whiskey production in this country: they wanted, in short, to keep to the pot-still whiskey.  They felt that their prosperity had been built on that and that their future lay in maintaining the production of the pot-still whiskey in the home market and for such exports as it was possible to secure in various parts of the world.  Their overriding fear was that we could not possibly compete with Scotch whiskey on the American market.  Suggestions were made to the distillers that the alcohol factories, which were capable of producing pure alcohol, which can be the base for a number of types of whiskey, might be converted to making a patent still whiskey; but again the distillers showed no interest in a proposition of that kind.</P>
    <P>In May, 1950, the matter was further considered by a Government sub-committee. They suggested that the Industrial Development Authority should approach a particular distillery to see if they were interested in securing the entire output of patent still whiskey from one of the alcohol factories, and whether they would be interested in leasing one of the factories, but the distillery approached at that time said that they had no interest in leasing the factory and that they proposed to establish some machinery for producing a patent still whiskey themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> The matter was considered again by the Government in September, 1952. Another approach was then made to the distilleries and, as a result of that approach probably, one firm which itself was not a distillery decided that it would produce a blend whiskey for the American market.  That firm has since produced this particular type of blend whiskey.  It is now engaged in promoting the sales of that whiskey on the American market.  It is not possible to say what success will attend its efforts, but I think everybody concerned with the expansion of our whiskey exports will wish that particular firm well.  It does not happen to be an Irish firm, but its enterprise deserves, in my opinion, all the commendation that we can confer upon it.</P>
    <P>Again, in June, 1953, my predecessor directed that Córas Tráchtála should be asked to initiate a scheme with the distillers with a view to developing an export trade in blended Irish whiskey. Discussions took place between Córas Tráchtála and the distillers.  At that time, Córas Tráchtála indicated to the distillers that it was undertaking a survey of the American market to ascertain Irish whiskey possibilities on that market.  They had engaged a particular research organisation in America to undertake this survey and the report of this survey at that time is of interest as showing the difficulties which have to be surmounted before we can get a foothold of any dimensions on the American market for our own whiskey of the traditional type, or for any new type of whiskey which we may blend.</P>
    <P>The information furnished by that market research organisation was that, while the distribution of Irish whiskey throughout the United States is good, it does not sell well because whiskey drinkers are not interested in it.  It was added by the research organisation that 50 per cent. of the whiskey drinkers questioned in the United States had never even heard of Irish whiskey.  That gives a picture of the problem confronting us.  The survey which was then made included taste testing for pot-still whiskey and for whiskey blended with grain spirit.  The conclusion arrived at was that it would <Col N="374" /> be rash to decide against the traditional whiskey with its established market which is capable of expansion.</P>
    <P>So far as American taste is concerned, a preference was shown, in actual taste tests for whiskey, for blended over the pot-still whiskey and the conclusions to be drawn from the investigations might be summarised as follows.  A promotional campaign of an order not hitherto contemplated is needed to expand the sales of Irish whiskey in the United States.  That requires co-operative education, advertising and publicity as an essential part of such promotion.  There was a view expressed that Irish pot-still whiskey sales were capable of expansion in the United States and Canada and that a considerable volume of sales might be expected from a light-blended Irish whiskey.  That promotional survey was brought to the notice of the distillers, but, although it was indicated to them that there was a market in the United States for a blended Irish whiskey in particular, and although they were encouraged in every possible way by the inter-Party Government, by the last Government and even by this Government, through Córas Tráchtála, they have so far shown no disposition, as a distillery industry, to go into the question of producing a blended whiskey for the American market.  Their attitude is that they know more about the business, that they know how to make what they call pot-stillers' traditional whiskey that they have good contacts in the United States and that they can sell that whiskey there.  Their attitude towards blended whiskey is that they are not interested in it.  They fear it cannot be sold there in competition with Scotch.  As I said, their main interest is in the home market.</P>
    <P>I do not accept these views of the distillers in any respect.  I believe there is a market in America for blended whiskey and I believe, at the same time, it is possible to sell in America the traditional pot-still whiskey of the Irish distillers.  What the distillers have to do is to take note of the whole trend in connection with whiskey exports.  Unless something is done, and done with some alertness, we shall have no export of whiskey at <Col N="375" /> all and the Irish whiskey industry will, if it follows its present pattern, be merely an industry for supplying the home market.</P>
    <P>In a report which has been made to me on this subject by Córas Tráchtala, which has done excellent work in trying to persuade the distillers to recognise the possibilities of the American market, they say that our whiskey exports go almost entirely to Britain, the Six Counties and the dollar area. The rest of the world takes only about 1 to 2 per cent. of our exports. Exports to Britain and to the Six Counties, which are of greater importance to the distillers than the dollar area, have fallen off from 220,000 cases in the year 1952 to 107,000 cases in 1953.  In the eight months of 1954, only 38,000 cases have been recorded for export.  So that from 220,000 cases exported in the year 1952, we get down to 38,000 cases in the eight months of 1954.</P>
    <P>The position in respect to dollar sales is equally alarming.  For the months from January to August, 1953, exports to the dollar area were 13,000 cases.  In 1954, during the same period, exports were only 8,000 cases, showing that here again on the dollar market and on the British and Six County markets, there has been a substantial diminution in exports.  That is a situation with which the distillers should be concerned.  That is a situation with which the House will be concerned and with which any Government, no matter of what political complexion, must be concerned, but the one impression left on everybody who discusses, with the distillers, the possibilities of exporting to the dollar markets and expanding export overseas, is that their overriding consideration is the home market.  In a way, that is not surprising, because consumption in the home market represents approximately 450,000 cases per year.  I am convinced, like many others who look on the problem objectively, without heat, passion or other feeling, that we can, through promotional activity, offer traditionally produced whiskey itself and, by the production of blended whiskey, secure a <Col N="376" /> very substantial market overseas, if we can go after the export markets which I think are available.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that my predecessor asked C.T.T. to discuss the question of establishing a new company for the purpose of promoting exports.  That proposal was made to the distillers by C.T.T. and the kind of company contemplated was explained to them but none of the distillers supported the idea of establishing a company to promote exports of Irish whiskey to the dollar markets.  They did indicate that, if State moneys were made available to them, they would be willing to take State moneys and advertise themselves but apparently they were not prepared to work in a pool with other companies for the purpose of their, themselves, generating an advertising campaign for Irish whiskey in America.  If they were to pool at all, they would pool by the attraction of whatever moneys the State might make available to them.  The clear impression which the distillers gave C.T.T. was that they were entirely opposed to the idea of an export company and that they had no desire to merge their individual identities in a company so constructed.</P>
    <P>The problem now before us is the problem of what can be done to step up our exports to the American and other markets.  The American market appears to offer the greatest attraction. Quite frankly, I think we were entitled to expect more co-operation from the distillers.  It is not unreasonable to say to them, with the product they have to market, that they should themselves push the sale of these products.  They are not now able to maintain their foothold on the American market or on the British market, not even on the market available in the Six Counties.  I have some figures here which show the exports of Irish whiskey to Great Britain and the Six Counties in 1948 were 305,000 proof gallons.  Five years later, in 1953, the figure was 160,000 proof gallons.  That is a situation which obviously should cause concern to the distilleries but there is no evidence before me, and there is certainly no evidence furnished to C.T.T. that the <Col N="377" /> distilleries are alive, not merely to finding an expanding market but even to retaining the foothold which they now have on some markets, slender and falling though that foothold now is.</P>
    <P>This problem is one which I think must be tackled.  One would wish that the distillers would co-operate to the full.  I know of no way in which they can do that better than by forming a company with a view to promoting the sale of Irish whiskey, wherever it is possible to sell that commodity.  I think they are unwise not to recognise the fact that there is a market in America for a light blended whiskey which suits the American palate.  There is abundant evidence that the American palate does not want the heavier, stronger Irish whiskey.  There may be, as I say, a limited market for the heavy Irish whiskey in America but it is an extremely limited market.  There is a very considerable market there for the lighter type of blended whiskey.  Even the Americans themselves who were producing a whiskey heavier than the present type of whiskey on sale have been compelled to move on to a lighter type of whiskey, even from their own distilleries, in order to cater for the desire of the American consuming public for a lighter type of whiskey.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to expect some co-operation from the distilleries. I think we are entitled to expect them to pool their ideas, their wisdom and their experience of whiskey production in order to establish a company capable of dealing with the promotion of the sale of Irish whiskey in America and elsewhere.  If they can be induced to do that it may be possible to provide some means by which their activities can be supplemented by the State. While that might give us a better sales and export organisation than we have at the moment, I still do not think that that is sufficient.</P>
    <P>If our distillers were wise they would recognise that there is a market abroad for this lighter type of blended whiskey.  They have all the alcohol they want here to provide that particular commodity if they will only set about the task.  Now some of our distilleries have not much whiskey for <Col N="378" /> export and it would be some years before some of them would have any noticeable quantity for export.  Others have whiskey for export.  One particular distillery has whiskey here for which it cannot find a market locally but for which it could find an export market provided it re-distilled the product for which there is no easy sale here.</P>
    <P>The chief difficulty I see from what I know of the problem and from what I have seen of it is that the big people who have the capital and the resources seem to be utterly uninterested in producing a blended whiskey.  Some of the smaller distilleries are interested. Three of them are at present experimenting with or producing a lighter type of blended whiskey for the American market.  The product of one of them is available for sale in America at the moment.  The others are near the stage at which their products will go on that market.  But their resources are relatively small, and it is difficult for them to meet the heavy promotional expenses where these expenses fall on the individual, small distilleries. If all the distilleries pooled their resources they could advertise this Irish lighter blended whiskey and in that way get better value for the money spent in promotional activities.  While protecting the traditional pot-still whiskey of this country, I think the real solution lies in a serious approach by the distilleries towards coming together and establishing a separate factory for the production of patent still whiskey.</P>
    <P>Let the existing distilleries sell their existing products here.  Let them export their existing products to Britain, America or elsewhere, if they can find a market for them, but there is abundant scope for the establishment of a new distillery to produce a lighter blended whiskey to suit the American palate.  I do not imagine that the establishment of such a distillery would enable us to shoot into the first place as whiskey producers and exporters overnight, but from all the information at my disposal, information gathered by C.T.T. after the expenditure of considerable effort, I believe there is a good prospect that if we establish a distillery here for the production <Col N="379" /> of a specially blended whiskey for the export market we will find an export market for that commodity.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a good deal of thought to this matter lately.  I have seen C.T.T. on many occasions and discussed with them ways and means by which we might enlist the goodwill of the distilleries.  So far I have not found any great enthusiasm among the big distillers.  A few small ones are now showing evidence that they are anxious to get into this export market and I hope they will be able to infect the larger distillers with the same enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not think it is too much to expect the distillers to come together and establish a separate distillery for the purpose of catering for a particular export market.  I would prefer to see it done in that way.  They have got the talent, experience and tradition; if the organisation for the production of whiskey is there, then obviously that organisation should be used before we try some other type.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that I must say to Deputy McQuillan that he has now had from me a statement of what successive Governments have done.  He has had an indication of my views in this matter.  He has had an indication of the policy I intend to pursue so far as the establishment of a distillery for the purpose of supplying the external market is concerned.  I recently had a discussion with a prominent person who knows the American market very well.  He is in a business organisation in America which distils and sells a variety of whiskeys in that market. That person is satisfied that we can produce and sell in America a blended whiskey and, while it would be premature at this stage to reveal the nature of the discussions or indicate the targets that are in view, I am not without hope that such discussions as have taken place so far will ultimately fructify in some arrangement whereby we can induce the distillers here to produce the type of whiskey required for the American market.  We may be able to avail of a first-class American organisation for the sale of that whiskey over the length and <Col N="380" /> breadth of the United States.  That may be a vain hope.</P>
    <P>I trust it is not and the discussions have proceeded on the basis that it may be possible to do something here to produce that particular grade of whiskey.  That whiskey could be bottled here and exported and spun into a nation-wide selling and distributing organisation and it could not but have very beneficial effects on the distilling industry and on the barley and grain-growing activities of our farmers and other ancillary occupations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Business could be done on that basis with the type of spirits that are available here, or that could be imported here temporarily if necessary, within 12 months.  The person with whom I discussed this matter is of the same opinion as I am, namely, that considerable expenditure will be involved in promoting the sale of Irish whiskey; C.T.T. have estimated that it would take approximately 200,000 dollars a year for a period of five years.  The other individual with whom I discussed the matter indicated that in his expert view it would be necessary to spend 1,000,000 dollars over a period of five years.  Perhaps there could be a slowing-down in advertising if the initial campaign were successful, but we cannot get into the America market merely by wishing ourselves into it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot get the Americans to drink Irish whiskey, whether pot-still or blended, merely by hoping they will order it.  If we want to get into the American market we shall have to sell ourselves into it and that will involve an expenditure of one kind or another by one organisation or another.  If we intend to have exports to America of blended whiskey and maintain our foothold there for pot-still whiskey, then that expenditure is inevitable.  How that money can be found, how it should be found, how it should be spent and the way in which <Col N="381" /> it should be spent are all factors which will have to be decided in connection with the future plan to be pursued in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan can have from me an assurance, if he wishes, that, so far as I am concerned, I will pursue this matter with a view to endeavouring to find markets for our exports and to induce the distillers to recognise that their real interest lies in finding markets for the products they now produce and producing a product which external markets will take.  I do not say that we should stop at relying on the distilleries, if there is no other way of getting the whiskey produced for export.</P>
      <P>I do not know, therefore, what Deputy McQuillan proposes to do with this motion.  My suggestion is that, having heard this explanation from me, he might be satisfied and if after a period of 12 months he does not see that progress has been made then he has permission to re-enter his motion any time he likes and have further discussion on the matter then.  Passing the motion will not accelerate in any way what I am trying to do.  Defeating it will not in any way slacken my efforts in what I am trying to do. Having heard the situation explained, perhaps Deputy McQuillan in the circumstances would take this as a progress report and he can return to the subject any time he likes.</P>

      <P>Having heard the suggestion made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I do not know what I should do but I propose to approach the motion directly and to deal with the difficulties of establishing a State-sponsored company to produce Irish whiskey for export.  I believe that Deputy McQuillan put forward this motion very sincerely and that he thought good could be done by creating a State-sponsored company to stimulate exports of whiskey.  I believe that he does not realise the magnitude of the task he would set before this company. I do not believe that in a generation there would come a number of workers into the industry and into the company who would be capable of producing the whiskey which he wants.  The brewing <Col N="382" /> and distilling industry in this country is one of its oldest and most respected.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It pays the highest wages.  It derives no subsidisation and no protection.  In the field of distilling, their efforts may not have met with the success that we may have desired but I do believe that they have done their very best.  The decision 50 years ago to produce a pot-still whiskey rather than a blend may have been a mistake, but the decision of 50 years ago is something over which Deputy McQuillan or I have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to change now after 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan cannot change what happened 50 years ago and I would like the Deputy to picture exactly what the position was 50 years ago.  The position was that, unfortunately, there was a very great British Empire stretching all over the world.  In every army canteen from Australia to India and Africa there was served up Scotch whiskey and Irish whiskey was excluded from that market.  Whiskey is an acquired taste. Just like a bottle of beer, the first one you take you do not like, and the whiskey that you get more often is the whiskey you prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like Deputy McQuillan to consider the position at present where it would be impossible for him to get ten hogshead of certain whiskeys in Dublin for export.  That is quite true.  He should remember that the good quality ten-year-old whiskeys that he would like to get on a market, blended or otherwise, are now not available for export because of deliberate Government action in 1944.  Posterity will judge whether that Government action was correct or not. We did produce just enough food to feed us during the war, but the facts are that the maximum price allowed for barley, the raw material of the whiskey industry, in 1941 was 30/- a barrel, whereas the price for wheat in the same year was 40/- a barrel.  In 1942, the percentage difference increased, inasmuch as the maximum <Col N="383" /> price for barley was 35/- a barrel and the maximum price for wheat was 50/-a barrel.  In 1943, the same situation existed.  In 1944, the difference was £1 as wheat was at 55/- a barrel.  That continued right on to 1947, when the price of barley was increased to 40/-and wheat stood at 55/-.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of how difficult it was for the brewing and distilling industries to get barley at that time, because I happen to be a barley agent.  I know that I could not get barley at 35/-.  The Northern Ireland distillers bought it in my constituency and smuggled it across the Border and, as a result, in 1954, you cannot get the top quality Irish whiskeys.</P>
    <P>A contributory factor to this enforced decline in production in the war years was the fact that we cannot use Irish anthracite in the production of whiskey. Unfortunately, Irish anthracite contains a percentage of arsenic and cannot be used in the ordinary kiln to dry corn in this country or to malt barley for the production of whiskey. Therefore, the industries had to work right through the war years with a very meagre ration of coal.</P>
    <P>There were two other factors, and one of them still exists, which have militated for the last 20 years against our capturing the export market.  One was insufficient control of exports and the other was too much control of exports. With regard to the first&mdash;insufficient control of exports&mdash;right through the war and until the present day it is possible to export from this country whiskey that is three years of age while it is not possible to sell whiskey within the country until it reaches the age of five years.  We seem to be adhering to the American idea of eat what you can and can what you can't. We seem to believe that the people whom we are trying to get to buy our whiskey abroad will do with it at three years' old when we will not consume it ourselves until it is five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Right through the war it was exported.  I had an experience immediately after the cessation of hostilities when I attended a football match in Scotland.  I went to a naval base at Rosyth.  Lying off Rosyth were two American destroyers and one cruiser.  There must have been a complement of 6,000 men in these three ships, all liable to come to the nearest bar and ask for whiskey.  I went into that bar with two other men and they asked for whiskey and they were told that they could get only bulk Irish whiskey.  I asked what bulk Irish whiskey was and I was told it was Irish whiskey of indeterminate quality which had been bought at a whiskey auction. I asked was it legal to sell that whiskey and they said it was.  I said: &ldquo;Would it be legal to sell indeterminate quality Scotch whiskey across the same bar?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;No, we have to watch our whiskey sales.&rdquo;  There you have a situation right at the end of the war where it was possible for 6,000 potential American customers to enter a bar and get bad quality Irish whiskey.  We must insist on quality, even in the case of pot-still.</P>
      <P>During the war the Irish distillers were not allowed to export great quantities of whiskey.  I see Deputy Lemass smiling but I would like to read for him his 1941 Emergency Powers (Export of Whiskey) Order, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It appearing to me to be necessary for maintaining supplies essential to the life of the community so to do, I, Seán F. Lemass, Minister for Supplies, in exercise of the powers conferred on me ...hereby order ...that ...any person ... who wishes to export whiskey by way of trade must apply to the Secretary, Department of Supplies, Dublin, and state the quantity of whiskey exported by the applicant during each of (certain) years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Great Britain and all over the world for ten years many more people than <Col N="385" /> ever before were able to buy whiskey. You had ex-servicemen away from their homes who could buy whiskey because they had the money.  You were cutting off supplies from those people and leaving them that they could not get it.  At the same time, Scotch whiskey was being exported and you could not get a bottle of it in Britain unless you paid £7 or £8 for it on the blackmarket. Irish whiskey being an acquired taste, I hold that more harm was done during those ten years to the Irish whiskey industry than was done in 50 years before.</P>
    <P>The answer lies in one thing and one thing only, and that is quality.  We cannot speed up matters in a short period of months or even of years.  If the high-grade whiskey which we want to produce must be ten years old, then there definitely must be a long-term policy.  I do not believe a State-sponsored company would aid the project. I believe the answer lies with the distillers themselves, and it must be a very slow answer.  Hope has been given to us by the Minister when he tells us (1) that an important sales organisation in the U.S.A. is interested, and (2) that a few small distilleries are interested in the production of a blended whiskey.  We do not know whether that £200,000 a year for five years which was spoken of would have the same effect if it were applied to the sales of pot-still whiskey as it would have if it were applied to the potential sales of blended whiskey.  If we adopt the motto <i>festina lente</i> and do our very best to instil into the distillers, if I may use a rather pert phrase, the idea that it is most necessary to the future of the nation that they capture the export market, and instil it in gentlemanly fashion without doing it, if I might quote Deputy McQuillan's adverbs as applied to the distillers, &ldquo;stubbornly and pig-headedly&rdquo;, we will have done more than we would by proposing motions in Dáil Éireann which would only irritate those men who did their best and who are doing their best.</P>
    <P>I will close by giving a few figures. The Irish whiskey trade is a small one. Deputy McQuillan has given us the figures for production and sales of <Col N="386" /> Scotch whiskey.  Our Irish whiskey trade has not really declined.  If we take the 10 years about which I was speaking, we see that in 1944 a total quantity of 707,774 gallons was released from bond and sold.  In the year 1951 &mdash;which is the last year for which I have got figures, a total of 1,224,928 gallons was released and sold.  This was made up in 1944 of 111,332 gallons for export and 596,000 odd for home consumption; and in 1951 of 438,000 for export and 786,000 for home consumption. Therefore, our Irish whiskey trade has made some progress.</P>
    <P>If it had been possible during the war to put more whiskey into bond it would probably be possible now to withdraw from bond whiskeys ten years old and blend them for the American market.  The whole thing against that, however, is the question of acquired taste.  I am sure it would be possible for Deputy McQuillan and myself to go out and buy several half-ones and produce blended whiskey, with the addition of distilled water, which would give that mild taste that the American palate demands.  When we have created the taste, however, could we be sure that this day ten years we could still supply the demand?</P>
    <P>The problem is a complex one and I believe that Deputy McQuillan's motion is not an approach to it which would bear any fruit.  The question must be left to the distillers.  The Minister and his organisations in constant contact with them will eventually break into the market and put the Irish whiskey industry on a par or nearly so with the Scotch counterpart. I do not think that the motion is a concrete contribution.  I believe that everything lies with the distillers and that the matter is so complex that it should be left to them and our very good Minister.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McQuillan's motion is a good one and that he has made a very good case for the solution of this problem.  In fact, he made so good a case that I thought there must be a catch in it somewhere. I do not know what the trouble is&mdash;for if Deputy McQuillan is right and if the Minister is right, the distillers must be fools.  What is wrong there?  Have the <Col N="387" /> distillers paid too much attention to quality?  Have we gone too far in that direction and, if we have, is that a bad thing?  I am not sure to what extent the distillers work with one another.  I do not like the solution that the Minister proposed, that the distillers would appoint some anonymous organisation or distillery or group which would then start to make something which they were ashamed to make themselves.  I do not like the idea of the one year product.  I do not know what the law in foreign countries is regarding the age of whiskey.  I could not see us being able to produce in a year's time enough for a current year's crop and keep on producing it year after year.</P>

      <P>And we would have to keep it for how long? At any rate, that seems to be a headache for the distillers.  I know that the Scotch distillers advertise in American periodicals and magazines.  If you take up the <i>New Yorker</i> you will see 24 or 25 advertisements for separate named brands of whiskey.  I understand there is combined marketing for Scotch whiskey, but in that combine they maintain the name of the firm making that whiskey for many years.  That is important from the consumer angle.  I am not a judge of Scotch whiskey, but I know a good deal about Irish.  I do not know to what extent this Scotch whiskey varies, but it is quite obvious that the Scotch people, by advertising or by the quality or by giving it the kind of flavour the Americans like, have got very much further than we have got or are likely to get in the near future.</P>

      <Col N="388" /> The Minister seems to be quite unsure and has not got a solution to this bad state of affairs.  I do not think his predecessor had any solution either. The disturbing thing that emerges from the whole discussion is apparently that the distillers have not got a solution, either.  With a declining trade&mdash; and it is extraordinary that it has declined&mdash;the production and output give us a headache.  It seems to be a contradiction in terms.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate because I felt that I had not a great deal to contribute to it, but some aspects of the matter are being ignored.  Deputy McQuillan gave us a very interesting account of the efforts made 50 years ago by the Irish distillers to secure the consent of a British Royal Commission to the making of a law prohibiting the use of the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; except in association with pot-still whiskey.  I think they were right to try it.  The great majority of Irish whiskey drinkers will hold the view that the only drink worthy of being described as &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; is pot-still whiskey. The distillers who tried to convince the British Royal Commission 50 years ago that that was right failed in their efforts.  The British Royal Commission agreed to allow the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; to be used in association with patent still whiskey.  I think mankind has lost a great deal because of that foolish decision by a British Royal Commission. It would have been far better for the world if the name &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; had been kept for the decent product produced by pot-still distillers in this country instead of being allowed to be associated with this semi-synthetic product which passes under the name of &ldquo;Scotch.&rdquo;  However, we have got to recognise that, since then, the world's taste has been debased and is now mainly directed towards procuring this inferior product which comes from the whiskey blenders who use a mixture of mature and immature spirit and pass it off as whiskey instead of the proper beverage, the pot-still product, to which that name should be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand the reluctance of the main Irish distillers&mdash;who, for <Col N="389" /> many years, have been producing good pot-still whiskey&mdash;to turn now to the production of an inferior product if there is any prospect at all of their being able to get back the market for the good product and educating the taste of the whiskey drinkers of the world, or any part of the world, in favour of good whiskey instead of the inferior blended product.  We have to recognise, however, that the bulk of the export market in the world is for blended whiskey&mdash;the lighter type of whiskey which is now sold mainly as Scotch whiskey.</P>
    <P>When, last year, I asked Córas Tráchtála, Teó., as the Minister has just mentioned, to arrange a conference between the distillers and Ceimici Teóranta and the Whiskey Exporters' Association to prepare a policy for an attack upon the American market with a blended whiskey I was fully convinced that that was the road to success. I am not as convinced now as I was then because, since then, we have had carried out by an expert organisation a market survey in the United States.  We cannot ignore the outcome of that survey.  These experts went round many cities in the U.S.A. asking bar keepers, bar workers and individual customers in bars to express their view upon the quality of Irish whiskey and to indicate their preferences in regard to whiskey.  Their view is that it is still a very open question whether or not we are likely to succeed better in the American market with the traditional Irish pot-still whiskey than with a blended product.  Before I left office, I did not see the full report which was submitted as a result of that survey.  I saw only a partial report.  I have seen since in the annual report of Córas Tráchtála, Teó., that the survey included taste-testing with pot-still and blended Irish whiskeys.  The report continues: &ldquo;The conclusion was that it would be rash to decide against the traditional whiskey with its established market, which as indicated above could well be extended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A very small part of the American whiskey market would represent very big trade for us.  It is true that all the imported whiskeys, both Irish and Scotch, are sold only in what could be described as the luxury market of the <Col N="390" /> U.S.A.  The Americans themselves mainly drink a product called rye whiskey, which Irishmen would call poison.  We cannot hope to cure them of that very bad habit and get them to drink a proper product such as we have available for them but in the luxury market of the U.S.A. there is an opening for imported whiskey.  That is mainly met by Scotch whiskey now. Big and all as the Scotch whiskey trade is in the U.S.A., it represents only 5 per cent. of the total American consumption of whiskey.  One per cent. would do us.  Is it possible to develop an educated taste for good pot-still whiskey in America which would secure for Irish whiskey 1 per cent. of the American whiskey market?</P>
    <P>I do not think we should abandon the idea of extending the market for pot-still whiskey in the U.S.A.  I do not think we have now to take that decision, as I was disposed to take some 12 months ago, in favour of concentrating our efforts on a blended product.  I believe we can, if we devise the right approach, help to retain and develop the market for pot-still whiskey and develop also an Irish product which will sell in America as a Scotch type of whiskey and get some of that trade for us.</P>
    <P>There is, however, this to be recognised. It is mainly a question of how much we are prepared to put into the promotion.  One appalling factor revealed by that American survey was that some 50 per cent. of the individuals approached by the market surveyors had never heard of Irish whiskey.  The question was asked here &mdash;and it is a proper question&mdash;whether we would do as well in the American market with Irish pot-still whiskey, without having argument and trouble here, if we spent the same amount of money on it as is now suggested we should spend on a blended whiskey.  I think that we might.  It must be quite clear that we cannot develop a trade in whiskey in the American market unless we are prepared to spend a great deal of money. But who will spend it?  I do not think there is any prospect whatever that the whiskey distillers here could, from their own resources, put up the money required and maintain <Col N="391" /> the expenditure at the level required for a long period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>Can they put up the whiskey, even?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever about that.  Perhaps I should deal with that, to some extent.  The Deputy spoke about restrictions placed upon whiskey exports during the war. That is true.  We decided that it would be the best policy, during the war, to make sure of our own supplies and to export the surplus.  The British Government, for another reason, preferred to leave their own people without any whiskey and to export it all.  I think we took the right decision&mdash;certainly from the point of view of those who wanted the supply of whiskey and also from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, and I do not think we took the wrong decision from the point of view of the publicans.  In due course, these restrictions upon the export of whiskey were removed.  I think I had the pleasure last year of signing the Order which removed the last of them, finally.  However, long before the war was over, I met the distillers' representatives and told them I was prepared to facilitate them if they were prepared to increase their distillations.  Now, that did not mean trade in 1945, 1946 and 1947.  The Irish distillers export whiskey at seven years old which meant trade in 1951, 1952 or 1953, and they were reluctant to undertake the financial commitment involved in that expansion, the substantial increase in distillation in 1944 and 1945 to deal with the particular situation seven years hence which they could not foresee.  If there is to be any encouragement to distillers to increase their distillations now, in anticipation of a growing trade seven years hence, then, to some extent, the Government must underwrite their commitments. I do not see any alternative to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our law requires that whiskey cannot be sold here unless it is five years old.  The American law says we cannot export whiskey to the United States at any lesser maturity than we allow it to be sold at home and there is a factor which we must take into account when <Col N="392" /> considering the possibility of breaking in on the Scotch trade in the United States.  The Scottish law permits whiskey to be sold in Scotland when it is three years old.  If we were to compete with the Scottish blenders and exporters of Scotch type whiskey we would be at the initial disadvantage that our exporters here would have to trade in whiskey which was not less than five years old, and therefore would cost more money to mature, against the Scotch exporter who can trade in whiskey at not less than three years old.  Should we change the law and permit of the sale here of whiskey of three years maturity?  That is a very large question of policy and, from the point of view of the interests of distillers, I have grave doubts whether we should or not because, up to the present, at any rate, the law has operated to give our distillers a certain protection in the Irish market that they could not otherwise get and their position here would be weakened and, consequently, their ability to extend anywhere might be reduced if we were to change that law.  That situation will change as time goes on and it is a matter that can be considered again and again but up to the present I am satisfied that it would have been a mistake to have changed the law here to permit of the sale in the home market of three-year-old whiskey.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of whiskey in the country and if we are thinking of a blended product there is a prospect of increasing the production of whiskey for blending.  As a matter of fact when I left office some months ago there was at that time a prospect that the alcohol factory at Carrickmacross might be sold to one firm that was interested in converting it to the production of patent-still whiskey.  They had made inquiries regarding the distillery and had inspected it.  I think Deputies know that a very small capital expenditure would convert any of these industrial alcohol factories into whiskey distilleries for the production of patent-still whiskey and there is available in the stocks of the other distilleries in the country sufficient pot-still whiskey to enable substantial quantities of the blended product to be sold if there was <Col N="393" /> more Irish patent-still whiskey available.</P>
    <P>The difficulty would not be in getting sufficient pot-still whiskey to meet an expanded trade in blended whiskey. It would be to secure an increased production of patent still whiskey and that can be done if plans are made for converting one of the industrial alcohol factories.  I thought for a time about the desirability of the Government or a Government organisation doing it but I think, on the whole that it is undesirable that the State should go into the whiskey distillery business or that State funds should be tied up in stocks of whiskey being held to maturity.  I believe&mdash;and this is an argument against one part of Deputy McQuillan's motion&mdash;that a State organisation trying to sell whiskey in the United States would run into real difficulties.  There is in America a certain prejudice against State trading and in any event a State organisation could not undertake the trade promotion methods that must be used if there is to be an expansion secured there.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McQuillan was unfair to existing distillers.  There are two main distillers in this country. As I understand the situation, one of them is not much interested in export markets at the moment because its home trade is extending sufficiently to take care of the supplies of maturing whiskey which it can see ahead for some years.  The other distillery is very much interested in the export trade and when I was in New York last year I met their representative there and learned something of the very strenuous efforts they were making to expand their trade in that section of the United States market, around the eastern seaboard, and that their company was spending a great deal of money on an advertising campaign, but that the campaign was barely noticed in the American Press. When one thinks of publicity in America one has to think in terms of enormous sums of money.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Whiskey Exporters' Association, a new association formed last year, and I told them that, when <Col N="394" /> I invited them to put up a scheme for the development of an export trade in blended whiskey, I was not ruling out the possibility of Government financial aid.  I told the Dáil at the time, and I still think, that many of the people on that deputation I met, members of that association, were people who just had stocks of whiskey on their hands and were thinking of selling these stocks to a Government organisation and that their interest in the export trade did not extend very far beyond getting rid of the immediate stocks that were worrying them.  So far as I know they did not produce any scheme such as I invited them to prepare.</P>
    <P>My experience with the members of that deputation&mdash;the deputation included some of the smaller distillers, as well as bonders, blenders and exporters who were not distillers&mdash; convinced me that if we are to try to develop a whiskey market without having the full co-operation and very active support of the main distillers we are not going to get very far.  They are fairly conservative in their outlook. That is true; they are perhaps too conservative.  They are, I think, unduly influenced by their recollection of another large distillery which some 25 years ago went into liquidation, and too determined to avoid the fate of the D.W.D.  They can avoid that fate by the conservative policy they are following but we can, I think, induce them to go further provided we are prepared to take from them some part of the very substantial risk which is involved in the expansion of their production with export trade in mind. That risk is considerable and it is no good minimising it.  A man who is making boots or clothing is making them this year to sell next year at the latest.  The man who is making whiskey is making it to sell seven years hence.  No one can forecast with any certainty what market conditions will be or what trade possibilities are going to exist in seven years' time. However, by some arrangement to give State assistance I think we can get some part of our trade back.  We must do it.  Whiskey exports are important to this country.  As Deputy McQuillan pointed out, they are falling <Col N="395" /> off very substantially.  Exports this year are dropping below last year.  All our export trade is important.  Every possibility of increasing our export trade must be investigated and the existing export trade must not be allowed to diminish.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that the Minister is interesting himself in the question of the distillery industry.  It is an important industry which had significant and substantial export business in the past.  We must give it every possible encouragement to fight to maintain that business, and while I would rule out State trading in any sense in that commodity, I think State aid will be required and I would like to leave open the very old question, whether the main effort should be directed towards increasing trade in the traditional pot-still Irish whiskey or a blended product, or whether investigations should be made to see if it was possible to do both.  That possibility may not be there.  Many years ago I tried to do some trade promotional efforts for Irish whiskey in Canada.  I thought it might be easier there because there was a Government monopoly in whiskey in some of the Canadian States, but we found there was a very bad whiskey exported from Belfast with more shamrocks, round towers and greyhounds on the label than you would see in the whole of Connemara.  It had so prejudiced public opinion against Irish whiskey that you just could not get them to look at Irish whiskey.  I am afraid that is still the case to some extent.  There is bad whiskey being sold as Irish whiskey and sometimes as &ldquo;Irish type&rdquo; whiskey.  Only a small part of it is Irish whiskey.  It is only by very effective trade promotional efforts and advertising that you can remove misunderstanding, break down prejudice and get a market for the good product we have to sell, and it is a good product. It is as a good product and high-grade beverage that we can get sale for it.  That is the market we are after and it is the only market available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to Deputy Lemass that it is most unreasonable <Col N="396" /> for him or any other Deputy in this House to put up the case that no whiskey in the world can touch Irish whiskey and that the pot-still Irish whiskey is the whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the best whiskey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass is entitled to his views on this.  The Americans are entitled to their views. The Scotch are entitled to their views, and I personally am entitled to my views, but the facts for the last 50 years have proved that in spite of the fact that the distillers maintain there is no whiskey in the world to beat their product yet their whiskey is not selling and has not sold, and less and less of it will be sold each year.  That is the plain fact.  If we get it into our heads that it is the customers we must please and not ourselves, then we will get somewhere with this matter.  There is no good in the Ceann Comhairle or I suggesting that this is a great commodity if the customer shrugs his shoulders or wriggles his spine after letting down a glass of Irish whiskey and says: &ldquo;I do not like that.&rdquo;  What is the use of trying to sell it to him then?  How many years are we going to wait until his taste so develops that he will care for that commodity? Nobody suggests that we close down the pot-still outfits at all.  They can cater for the home market.  Deputy Lemass let the cat out of the bag, even though he feels himself that the Irish pot-still is the best product on the market, when he says the fact that we cannot sell Irish whiskey unless it is five years old helps to protect the Irish distillers from Scotch competition.  We know that if the five-year period was raised to-morrow morning the Irish distillers were sunk.  The Scotch can sell their whiskey at three years old and they do so in America, but the Irish whiskey cannot be sold until it is five. If we produce a blended commodity and change our laws with regard to America we will have to allow the Scotch to come in here and the Irish whiskey in competition will not stand a pup's chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan from Louth, and now Deputy Lemass, are all keen to bolster up the case of the distillers, <Col N="397" /> and their sole argument in favour of the distillers is that this whiskey is the best whiskey produced in the world.  It is like everything else that we do in this country.  Everything produced in Ireland is the best in the world.  We live in a kind of cuckoo land here.  We say no country in the world is like us. Perhaps, it is a great way to live, putting a shell round ourselves like that.</P>
    <P>I did not deal in detail with the by-products that are available in the distilling industry.  I wonder how many Deputies realise that at the present time in America several of the distillers could give away the whiskey and make a substantial profit on the by-products, that the whiskey itself is actually only a side line in the distilling with these American outfits?  The benefits conferred on the American agricultural community from the by-products available from the distilling industry are tremendous.  Not alone have farmers all these by-products available for feeding stuffs but they are available in the field of medicine, in the industrial sphere, in the plastic world and so forth.  The by-products of the distilling industry are now being fully utilised so that from the moment the barley goes into the ground until the final processes are finished there is not the slightest bit of waste in all that takes place.</P>
    <P>There is an advantage to the community as a whole.  The Minister has suggested that the distillers have indicated their willingness to accept Government aid to back their own commodity.  I am not a bit surprised at that.  That is practically the suggestion Deputy Lemass is making to the Minister, that the distillers who have for 50 years failed to get an export drive going should now be backed up to the extent of practically 200,000 dollars per annum to sell a commodity that will not be bought by Americans or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the report issued by Córas Tráchtála and let us make our minds up to this that the distillers &mdash;I will not say all of them but individuals&mdash;made use of every possible means available abroad to ensure that pot-still whiskey would appear in the most beneficial light when the reports <Col N="398" /> would be discussed in this House.  I will not go any further into that.</P>
    <P>As far as the investigation that was carried out on the American market with regard to the possibility of developing an export trade, at the time Córas Tráchtála started that investigation it was rather significant that an Irish distiller had its own agents over there and carried out its own investigations.  That was the first time they thought of it.  They reported naturally enough that the pot-still whiskey was the whiskey to sell in the American market.  It all boils down to this.  Are we going to give to the customers what they want or ram down their throats what we want them to take?  Because a few people in this country since 1870 have said that the Irish pot-still whiskey is the best, are we going to keep up that outlook to-day when we see the evidence that our sales are falling year after year? It is even admitted by the spokesman of the distillers in this House that if the present restriction on the five year period was removed the Irish distillers would be in a bad spot in their own country.</P>

      <P>As far as American laws are concerned, no whiskey can be imported into America at an earlier age than that at which it is sold in the country of production.  In other words, if we sell whiskey in Ireland at a five year period it must be five years old before the Americans will buy it from us, but if our laws allowed whiskey to be sold in Ireland at three years' <Col N="399" /> maturing period then we would be entitled to export that whiskey to America.  The Scottish exporters are exporting to America at three years.</P>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House. The Tánaiste has pointed out that the inter-Party Government from 1948-1951 got down on their knees to the distillers and were as nice as could be to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it another way.  The inter-Party Government in their concern to see the distilling industry expanded, consulted these gentlemen and suggested to them that the time had arrived when they would have to take more active steps in order to ensure the desirable expansion and that these gentlemen listened in a courteous fashion to the advice and admonitions of the inter-Party Ministers and having heard them, let it in one ear and out the other and disappeared: that this went on from 1948 to 1951, and in 1951 we had a change of Government and the same admonitions and good advice were given again to the distillers but there was a different spokesman&mdash;Deputy Lemass as he now is.  Then, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he requested the distillers to take all possible steps to increase their export trade.  In 1953 we find, after all the efforts made by both Governments, that we are selling less whiskey abroad than we were in 1948, prior to the advice being given to these men.</P>
      <P>It is admitted by the Tánaiste and by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce that this is an industry that could be of tremendous importance to the country and yet neither of them has a solution.  Are we to take it from the Tánaiste that if this 12 months' period that he mentions is given and at the end of 12 months we find the situation is the same, he has made up his mind to take the necessary steps at the end of that period? The motion I have here states that steps should be taken immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The steps outlined in the motion.  At the very beginning of the discussion I emphasised that the words &ldquo;if necessary&rdquo; left the Minister plenty of scope.  I am convinced from what he said and from having listened also to Deputy Lemass that it is necessary to set up this company because these individual distillers have flouted the different Governments and there is no use in saying we cannot touch these people, that we need their services. There are three other distillers in the country who are prepared to work and co-operate and it is these small groups who have acted as pioneers in producing blended whiskey.  There are two excellent blended products available at the moment.  Why not get a group of distillers who are willing to get together? Why not get as many as possible if we cannot get them all, and get them to pool their resources because that is what is necessary. Otherwise, in the long run, this State will be forking out valuable dollars to back up one or two distillers who are now adopting, as I would describe it, a pig-headed, stubborn attitude.  These people will get spokesmen in this House to back them up for the next 50 years.  Deputies will come in and say on their behalf as an excuse, that they could not build up an export trade because Fianna Fáil during the war years prevented them from selling whiskey in America.  That is just &ldquo;bull&rdquo;.  I do not know if that is parliamentary language or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Deputy from Louth who mentioned this particular business to know this&mdash;that in 1934, well before the war, the Irish distillers got first preference from President Roosevelt to sell Irish whiskey in America and were given their quota a month before it was given to the Scottish distillers when prohibition was repealed.  The answer given by a prominent member of the Seanad who was a member of one of the distilling organisations at the time was: &ldquo;I want all my whiskey for my customers at home.  I cannot supply American customers.&rdquo;  That answer can be given in full if necessary and the Minister who got the quota was <Col N="401" /> the Irish Minister in America at that time.</P>

It was put down to find out what the reactions are, and I thought it would be much better to clarify the situation. I am sorry that the Tánaiste, although he has agreed right down the line with everything I have said about the distilling industry and the need for taking active steps, can only tell me that he is going to make further appeals to the distillers to remember their responsibilities, after six years' experience of them and knowing he is going to get the same answer in 12 months' time. Why are we allowing invaluable time to slip by while not a day in the week passes that we are not told of the absolute necessity of increasing our earnings in the dollar area?</P>
      <P>I can see that if this particular matter were allowed to develop as it has developed for the last six years we will have another election in three or four years' time and there will be another motion before the House by some other Deputy, and he will be pushed off with the same skill that the present Tánaiste displayed in this debate to-night.</P>
      <P>I want this motion to be put to the House unless the Tánaiste is prepared to give me a guarantee that if this company is not established by the distillers themselves within 12 months he will accept this motion and have such a company set up by the State at the expiration of that time.</P>

I cannot say whether this will materialise but, if it does not, we will have to fish again and perhaps in other waters.  It is unreasonable to ask me at this stage to give a guarantee, or even to say, without advertence to circumstances, that I will do certain things, because one does not know what the situation will be 12 months hence.  In any case, the motion would commit us to setting up a State factory to produce blended whiskey, even for the Irish market, and nobody wants to do that.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following be adopted as a Standing Order of Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>123A.  There shall be appointed, as <Col N="403" /> soon as may be after the commencement of every Session, a Select Committee, to be called &ldquo;The Committee of Public Expenditure&rdquo;, to examine such of the Estimates presented to the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order No. 117 as may seem fit to the Committee and to report what, if any, economies consistent with the policy implied in those Estimates may be effected therein.</P>
    <P>The Committee shall consist of 17 members, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary and five of whom shall constitute a quorum.</P>
    <P>The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 67 and 70, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Committee may appoint sub-Committees and may refer to such sub-Committees any of the subjects which are within the purview of the Committee.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Committee shall be <i>ex officio</i> a member of each sub-Committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee and its sub-Committees shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and to adjourn from place to place.  Three shall be a quorum of each sub-Committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee shall have power to report from time to time.</P>
    <P>In the last Dáil I brought this matter up and at that time it seemed to have a reasonable hope of becoming practical politics.  However, circumstances ruled otherwise, and, with the ending of the previous Dáil, the motion lapsed.  I find myself in a difficulty in avoiding as far as possible a rehash of previous arguments.  My arguments on the previous occasion are on the records of the Dáil and I do not want to waste the time of the House by undue repetition.</P>
    <P>This matter of a committee to consider the Estimates is one which I think is, or should be, of interest to every individual member of the House and also to the entire House collectively, <Col N="404" /> because what it seeks to do is to enable the Dáil to function a bit more expressly than it can under present conditions.  The Dáil, after all, is responsible to the country for the running of the State's business and I believe that at present there is a gap, and a very wide gap, in the Dáil's knowledge and the Dáil's interest.  I think a committee such as this would close that gap.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make undue reference to the fact that the system works elsewhere under similar parliamentary institutions.  Some of the reports of an Estimates Committee in another place might lead one to think that an estimates committee was not altogether a good thing.  Some of them are characterised more by the number of words in them than the amount of effect they are likely to produce, but then that is something that is likely to happen to any parliamentary institution. I do not think we should allow any possible failings to blind us to the possible good that might come.</P>
    <P>At present the only check, the only intimate check, the Dáil has on the business of the State is through the Public Accounts Committee.  Of necessity, the check that it makes is from one and a half to two years after the event and my feelings on this subject are very much coloured by 11 years' experience of the Public Accounts Committee.  It has been borne in on me time and time again that something more was needed to ensure economy.  One of my difficulties in presenting a case for this motion is that I can think of quite a number of special items in the business of the State which I think I could develop to prove my point, but obviously that would be very unfair because I should be speaking without full knowledge and it would not be at all fair to pinpoint a particular Department or section of a Department as being open to suspicion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but I do not think this is the place for it, and from that point of view I have more or less to pull my punches.  However, I hope <Col N="405" /> to give some general ideas of the type of inquiry which an Estimates Committee might usefully make, without in any way suggesting that Departments are being lax.</P>
      <P>The system at present is that the preparation of Estimates is a more or less continuous business in Departments, just as the auditing of the accounts is a more or less continuous business.  The Estimates have to come to finality at a certain time of the year and must be presented to the Dáil for its consideration, just as the accounts must come to an end on 31st March each year and be presented to the Public Accounts Committee.  What happens to the two sets of figures presents a very marked difference.  So far as the accounts are concerned, they come before the Public Accounts Committee and can be examined in detail, with the aid of the accounting officers of the Departments and anyone else whom the Committee wishes to examine.  In other words, the Committee has available to it the people who are responsible for the accounts and can query specific items in them.</P>
      <P>So far as the Book of Estimates is concerned, the Dáil, in Committee on Finance, of course, discusses the Estimates, but, in plain fact, what the Dáil does discuss is the policy of the Estimates and the administration of the previous year.  It is not possible for the Dáil to examine these in any business-like way.  There are many things in the Book of Estimates which, from a business point of view, are far from clear.  It is not possible for Deputies to discover how it works and why it works in any Department.  It is not physically possible to do so.  We cannot have in the Dáil officers from the Department to answer particular queries, and it is not possible in a debate on the Estimates to have the give and take that one gets by question and answer in the Public Accounts Committee, a Committee of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the pressure of parliamentary time is such, in the financial part of the year anyway, that the examination of the Estimate must necessarily be cursory and restricted entirely to policy.  I do not think that <Col N="406" /> is altogether a happy state of affairs. There are people who think these matters are very technical and that Deputies, possibly, are not qualified to make an examination into the efficiency of a Department or even into inter-departmental work.  I do not think that the Dáil should go on record as suggesting that it is not capable of doing work like that.  My own view on this sort of high pressure business which goes on in the case of business audits is that the type of work they do can be related to State work or Government work in Departments. Politicians who get elected to the Dáil have their weaknesses but they are a fair cross-section of the public and I think that it is only right that they should have an opportunity to make an examination of the Estimates on behalf of the public.  I think that such an examination would prove to be quite useful.  No one would suggest that where £108,000,000 is asked to run the public services for the year, a very useful examination could not be made to discover possible economies.  I do not want to suggest that necessarily one must view the Civil Service with the eye of suspicion, but it must be remembered after all that as compared with an ordinary private enterprise, one particular motive is lacking in the Civil Service and that is the profit motive.  That is the motive which operates most to keep a business run efficiently and that motive does not apply to the public service.  Something else must replace it.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger that a Minister in dealing with his Department may unduly allow himself to be persuaded that certain steps are necessary to carry out his policy.  His job is to get policy carried out.  I do not see how any Minister could possibly have time to ensure that in fact his policy was being carried out in the cheapest possible way; yet it is obviously in the public interest, the taxpayers' interest, that the business should be carried out in the cheapest possible way.  On the question whether a committee of the House would help to ensure the best possible way, some doubts might be expressed.  The same <Col N="407" /> doubts could be expressed as to the efficiency of the Public Accounts Committee in dealing with the Appropriation Accounts.  After all, the Public Accounts Committee consists of members of this House, none of them expert in finance or accountancy.  They have, of course, only to finish off the job that has been started by such experts. Still there is always a certain amount of business brought before the committee with which they have to deal in a common-sense way and, though I believe doubts have been expressed from time to time, my own opinion is that normally they do carry out their functions reasonably well.</P>
    <P>There is also a doubt as to whether, even if an Estimates Committee discovered there were things which might be done better, whether, in fact, any improvement would result.  Again, the Public Accounts Committee has no real power, yet we know that its recommendations are quite frequently followed. As to the type of work which an Estimates Committee might usefully do, as I have already said, without going into particular details or pointing to any Department or sections of a Department, it is not very easy to make a clear case, but there are certain lines of inquiry which anyone, who was on the Public Accounts Committee is bound to have in mind.  There is, for instance, the difficulty in discussing the Accounts or the Estimate of any Department&mdash;the fact that the Committee on Finance dealing with it is limited to the affairs of that particular Department, in other words what is called a vertical inquiry.  A horizontal inquiry is not possible and yet there are many things in the Civil Service which are common to the several Departments into which some inquiry should be made.</P>
    <P>For instance there are technical staffs, engineering staffs, in several Departments.  I do not want to go too far but I think it would be fair to suggest that occasionally one might have some sort of suspicion that there may be a certain amount of overlapping. At the moment, it is not at all certain whether that is true or false <Col N="408" /> and it is essential to discover whether it is true or false.  An Estimates Committee could inquire into it.</P>
    <P>There is then the question or the use of office machinery in Departments. There are such things as contract forms.  There must be a multiplicity of them in the different Departments and the different offices.  There are several other things of a similar kind&mdash;the use of staff and whether or not there is redundancy.  I know that internally there are certain checks. The Department of Finance itself checks the Estimates of all Departments. There is within the Department of Finance and in the Civil Service, a section known as &ldquo;Organisation and Methods&rdquo;.  So far it is fairly restricted in its use.  I think that in the Department of Finance there are three officers engaged on O. and M. but in any other Department the most there is is a fairly junior officer.  I think there should be a parliamentary inquiry through the Estimates Committee, which would see if something further could not be done in regard to O. and M.</P>
    <P>A point I want to make is that a committee such as this would have to act in harmony with the Department. Inevitably there will be points of disagreement but as long as the committee transacts its business in such a way as to be reasonable, no difficulty should arise.  In fact, I think there is no reason to suspect that anything would happen other than a reasonable way of doing business.  If the committee attempted to do anything else, it would first of all fall foul of the Government and the fact that it would be falling foul of Departments would probably stultify any work the committee tried to do, so that I do not think any difficulty would really arise in that respect. One of the great difficulties of the present moment is the growth of public business.  The business of the State and the business of this House have grown enormously.  There has been continual pressure in the financial part of the year in the discussion of Estimates, so that there should be plenty of scope for a committee dealing specially with the subject.  There is also the fact that, with the growth of <Col N="409" /> public services, it must become increasingly difficult for Ministers to exercise complete control of their Departments.</P>
    <P>That, again, leaves some useful fields for Deputies but, unless they have a committee to work through, the ordinary Deputy is stultified in any such approach.  The ordinary approach to discovering how a Department works is through the medium of parliamentary question.  That suffers from two defects; one is that the Deputy asking the question has to take a leap in the dark, more or less, because he hears something and puts down a question to the Minister to elicit what the true position is.  It does not really constitute an inquiry at all.  He is also limited as to how far he can pursue the matter once he receives an answer. A debate on the Adjournment is the ultimate limit and, even there, there is no way of having a proper examination.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that I have reverted in this motion to calling this suggested committee a Committee of Public Expenditure.  That was my original proposal.  The general idea was adopted by the former Minister for Finance but he changed the title to Committee of Estimates.  Now I personally do not care what it is called.  My only reason for preferring &ldquo;public expenditure&rdquo; to &ldquo;estimates&rdquo; is that I think a clearer picture is given as to what the real function of such a committee would be: to call it purely a Committee of Estimates is a rather slavish copy of something that happened elsewhere and is, I think, inclined to give people the impression that the only concern of such a committee is to look at the Book of Estimates, as presented to the Dáil, and make such inquiries as are obvious on the face of that.</P>
    <P>I do not think a committee could work in that way at all.  To my mind, the name does not matter.  For one thing, the proposal sets the limit on the committee: &ldquo;to examine such of the Estimates presented to the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order No. 117 as may seem fit to the committee and to report what, if any, <Col N="410" /> economies consistent with the policy implied in those Estimates may be effected therein.&rdquo;  That confines such a committee to direct public business.  I think that possibly to change from &ldquo;public expenditure&rdquo; to &ldquo;estimates&rdquo; which was suggested by the former Minister for Finance was due to a sort of fear that this committee might tend to start inquiring into certain State-sponsored companies because it could be argued that they represented in a way &ldquo;public expenditure&rdquo; but, in fact, the terms of reference of the committee are quite clear.  Its inquiries are limited to the Estimates as presented.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I have no particular feelings on the subject of the name.  Indeed, if that were the only difficulty it would be easily overcome. I think, however, that &ldquo;Committee of Public Expenditure&rdquo; gives a clearer idea of the intention of the committee; that is, to inquire into public expenditure and ensure that for every 20/-spent value is received for every £1 spent and that no more pounds are spent than are absolutely necessary. It must frequently happen in public business that certain desirable objects have to be obtained and expenditure is not necessarily the first consideration. What I wonder is how far that principle prevails because no private Deputy has any evidence of any kind on that particular matter.  No private Deputy has any evidence as to how the Civil Service works and I think it would be useful to have a committee to inquire into that.</P>
    <P>I have no idea as to whether or not I am, as it were, pushing an open door. The Minister has been very discreet in any conversations I have had with him in this matter.  I have not pressed him for an opinion.  It was not that I hoped to sway his mind; indeed, I thought it would be better if I did not, but I appeal to him to consider the fact that this is possibly worth a trial. I do not see how it can do any harm. The amount of good it may do is naturally conjectural; it will depend on who is on the Committee and how they go about their work.  But I do not think that the fact that the good it may do is conjectural should deter us from trying something which has <Col N="411" /> proved useful elsewhere and which, I think, could prove even more useful here.</P>
    <P>This House, after all, is the only thing that stands between the country and bureaucracy.  There is a set tendency all the time towards having things done in a swift, direct way.  Bills that are introduced and Acts that are passed repeatedly have provisions in them under which the Minister does most of the work by Order.  The details are not in the Act at all.  Doubts have been expressed here time and time again as to the wisdom of that procedure and the taking away of control from the public direct.  The Dáil does not know how far things will go because Ministers can do so much by Order.</P>
    <P>The situation is similar in relation to the financial business.  Deputies meet here and, after discussion, they pass Estimates for the public service; but they know very little of the background behind those Estimates.  I consider it is their duty to know.  At the present time we are debarred from giving assistance in relation to economy except in the loosest possible way and I cannot see that that kind of assistance in a debate on Estimates is of any practical value.</P>
    <P>If there is any way in which the functioning of such a Committee could be limited to a certain length of time in order to discover whether useful work is or is not being done I would be very happy to incorporate that limitation, but I do not see how that would work.  If it does not work and if the Committee fails to produce any worthwhile results the Dáil has a very easy remedy, namely, to reverse the proposition I am putting before the House to-night.  I think myself that eventually a committee system may grow up entirely in relation to parliamentary control and I think this would be a useful step in the right direction because it would provide Deputies with something to do, something which would prove of a real value.</P>
    <P>One very important point is that it would give Deputies an insight into the running of the State.  That is <Col N="412" /> something they find it very difficult to achieve at present.  It would not astonish me to find that Governments might resent that: there is naturally a tendency to produce a rabbit out of a hat, though that does not necessarily mean that that particular rabbit is a better rabbit.  I think the general idea is reasonably clear from the terms of the motion.  Of course one Committee could not deal with all the various facets likely to be presented to it and, therefore, I propose that the original Committee be given the power to set up sub-Committees to deal with specific lines of inquiry. What has been found useful in another place is the fact that the chairmen of the various sub-Committees form a committee of their own to suggest lines of inquiry.  Probably that would work here quite well.  If, however, some other method can be suggested, a method which is parliamentary, I will be happy to hear of it.  I hope the Minister will not start talking about efficiency and bringing in experts from outside to advise because, for that, I would not give tuppence. My concern is not only to ensure increased efficiency in the Civil Service, if it is necessary, but to ensure also parliamentary control.  Parliamentary control is the proper thing.  It is the really important point.  As it is, parliamentary control suffers because of one very wide gap; that is, that Dáil Deputies have no immediate concern with or knowledge of how the Estimates are framed or how efficient Departments are within themselves.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the relationship between the various local authorities throughout the country and the central Government through the Department of Local Government.  As a member of a local authority I have frequently had doubts raised in my mind as to just how well the various local authorities and the central Government get on together, whether it is not possible that a more streamlined machinery could be found, whether there is not overlapping there with too many checks and re-checks as between the two sets of bodies.  A parliamentary inquiry into that would be very illuminating and very helpful, not only to the Government as a whole but <Col N="413" /> to the Minister for Local Government It would certainly be very interesting to members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am seriously tempted, of course, to go into a few more precise details of things that I think it might be useful to inquire into but, as I have said, I do not think it is quite fair.  In what I have said about the Department of Local Government I am not suggesting in any way that it has a deliberate policy of hampering local authorities, but there is a certain amount of delay and friction between the two and I think an inquiry by a body of sensible men in this House might lead to smoothing out the difficulties that are there.  Very much the same thing applies to other Departments.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to one or two things that I would be glad to see inquired into in a general way.  I am far from satisfied that Organisation and Method is being operated as far as it should.  I am not at all happy about the use of experts in various Departments. Further than that I do not wish to go.  I think I have said enough there to raise questions in Deputies' minds as to just how efficiently the Service is being run, and whether we can be satisfied with it or whether we can as private Deputies through a committee help the State to be more efficient.  Of this I am very sure, that it is certainly the desire of the Civil Service to be efficient and to run well. That is one thing I do want to say.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that my 11 years' experience on the Public Accounts Committee has continually favourably impressed me with the devotion to duty, to put it that way, of the Civil Service, but that does not say that the Civil Service is perfect.  It does tend to be a closed body with a special point of view and, I think, a bit of the ordinary common sense point of view of the man in the street, and the man from down the country blowing through it might do a great deal of good, and that this is a good parliamentary way to do it.  I heartily recommend it to the Minister and to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheldon, in putting down this motion, has made it quite clear that he has put it down and has spoken in the House on it with the view, in his mind, that it will assist in economy, and by &ldquo;economy&rdquo; I mean economy in its true sense, that is to say, getting the best value for one's money.  With that aim everyone will be in entire agreement.  It is particularly essential at the present time that we should do everything in our power to ensure that whatever moneys are voted by this House for any particular service or for any particular aim or for any particular policy should be so spent and so utilised as to get the best possible value.  Where the Deputy and I, however, may possibly differ is on whether this is going to achieve, because I pay him the compliment of accepting that he does in fact believe that it would achieve what he has in his mind.</P>
      <P>In expressing the views that I will express on this motion to the House I want to make just this reservation: I have not had the experience that Deputy Sheldon has had of serving as a private Deputy on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Perhaps more is the pity.  Certainly, the Deputy's service on that committee has been long and he has given it a very great deal of attention and, for that reason, his views must be given due weight.  I have only had, as the occupant of this seat for the moment, some four or five months of viewing the Civil Service machine from the inside, not a very long time and a time which has been, as the House will accept and appreciate, somewhat full of other conceptions as well as that of standing back and looking at the picture of the machine as such.  I am, therefore, in this position that, while I have views certainly on this motion at the present moment I shall not say that those views are as crystallised as they might be after perhaps another 12 months or two years, when I have had an even better opportunity of judging the machine from the inside.</P>

      <P>It will take me only two years to judge this particular aspect of it.  I believe that what is at the back of Deputy Sheldon's mind in putting down this motion or in suggesting that there should be this committee is that he wants, as he says himself, to inquire how the Civil Service works. However laudable may be the Deputy's anxiety to learn how the Civil Service works, I do not think that that is in itself a good reason for the establishment of this committee.  I think the Deputy is making one very big mistake and that the House would be making one very big mistake if they accepted this motion on the basis that such an Estimates Committee has been in use for some time across the water.  It is not unfair to say to Deputy Sheldon that the real reason why this thought occurred to him was that he has read or seen of an Estimates Committee that has been in operation in Great Britain since 1912.  In fact, everybody admits on the other side, according to all the information available to me, that, certainly up to the end of the last war, that Estimates Committee was a complete failure.  I think that is admitted on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy does accept that.  What is the prime difference now since 1946, say, and the previous time?  The prime difference is the very thing that Deputy Sheldon stressed several times during his speech, that the public business is tending to become more and more great and the reason this Estimates Committee has been kept in Britain after some 30 years of failure was that in Britain they do not discuss the Estimates in detail in their House in the same way as we discuss them in detail in this House.  Their method is that they will take one or two groups of Estimates in any year and they will discuss only certain limited and picked groups of Estimates and you will find quite often there that there will be years in which Estimates of a particular Department do not come before the House as a whole.  I believe that if this motion were adopted here it would be the thin end of the wedge and that the next step <Col N="416" /> would be a suggestion in the future that there was not any necessity for this House to discuss the Estimate for every Department because the Estimates Committee would go into that discussion and Deputies would gradually find in this House that there were arguments being put forward that the detailed discussion of the Estimates for the various Departments that is carried on here year after year would not be necessary.</P>

      <P>Quite, and if the Deputy looks he will find that they do not take every Estimate every year in the way we do here.</P>

      <P>There is no suggestion in England that the Committee on Estimates deals with Estimates which do not come before the House of Commons. There is no separation as to what comes before the House of Commons and what comes before the committee. Most of the useful work of the Estimates Committee is done by using it for inquiries which have no relation to one particular Department at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  That is exactly what I am saying.  What I am saying is that in the British House of Commons they do not consider it necessary to discuss in the House as a whole the Estimates for each Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because perhaps they will be discussed in Committee. <Col N="417" /> I do not want to permit in this House any step to be taken that could be utilised in future as a suggestion that it is not necessary to discuss Estimates as such in relation to each particular Department and I think that would be ultimately the logical outcome of this motion if the committee that it is proposed to be set up here was in fact to have any reason at all.</P>
      <P>What is the position in regard to expenditure?  We all know that, by and large, it is on matters of policy that savings may be effected on the one hand or increased expenditure may be necessary on the other hand.  By and large, that is the main reason for less expenditure or more expenditure. I have not any idea what exactly the Deputy has in his mind as regards this committee.  I understand from him that he says it will not discuss policy. Very well.  I will accept that because, of course, if he tried to make the point that it would discuss policy I would at once join issue with him on it.  I will assume that it will not be for any question of policy and that it will be able to avoid the pitfalls of taking the dividing line between what is policy and what is pure administration.  It is a very, very difficult line in many cases to take, but I am assuming that such committee would be able to take that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will it operate?  Is it intended that it would operate before the money was spent?  Is it intended that it would operate before the Estimates came into this House?  If the Deputy concedes that the debates will be taken in this House as well, is it intended that it would operate before the Department of Finance has concluded its scrutiny of the Estimate or would it merely operate after the Estimate has been taken in the House and has been approved?  For the very good reason that the Deputy, even with his 11 years' experience on the Public Accounts Committee, is still in the same position as I was in five months ago of not having seen things from the inside, I do not think that he really has a clear mind as to what he is looking for in this committee.  I say that with all due respect to the Deputy's own view, accepting, as I <Col N="418" /> said a second ago, that he is clearly looking for something that he believes will bring economy and sincerely believes will bring economy.</P>
    <P>How does the machine work?  It is necessary to look at it for a minute. The ordinary departmental method is quite simple in essence.  The spending Department makes its proposal.  The Department of Finance puts in its criticism, its limitation, its restriction on that proposal.  After considerable adjustment, perhaps even adjustment on policy level in the Government, the amount that is to be included in the Estimate for the next year is agreed. That having been done, the detailed way in which that money will be spent is again put forward by the spending Department to the Department of Finance and is sanctioned if it is within the limits of the Vote and if it is within the limits of the administrative direction at the particular time.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy has in mind that this committee would operate only after the sanction has been given.  The effect of it in that respect would be that you would tend on the one hand to take the line that the Department of Finance need not exercise its critical function because the critical function would be exercised by the committee or else that the committee would be merely working as an <i>expost facto</i> quicker intermediary on public accounts, a quicker survey than the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>In passing I might say on that that the Deputy is also well aware that on the other side there was a suggestion at one time that there would be a general Public Expenditure Committee to cover the Estimates Committee they have and the Public Accounts Committee and that that was rejected out of hand because it would invalidate and harm the non-Party line that is always taken on the Public Accounts Committee.  I think that was the main reason why they rejected that.</P>
    <P>I cannot see for the life of me where the Deputy thinks this committee will have a useful function.  If it will take up its stand between the time the Estimate is framed and the time the work will be done it will add yet another cog to the administrative <Col N="419" /> machine.  It if is to do its work after the work has been sanctioned and when the work is being carried through it will operate only in the same way but in a slightly quicker way perhaps than the Public Accounts Committee.  If the latter is the case, it could be met much easier by another system of dealing with the Public Accounts Committee to ensure that it in its turn is far more a constant thing as it is ordered rather than that the Public Accounts Committee should wait until the whole accounts for any particular year are completely audited and completely published.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies from time to time have become exasperated with the Department of Finance and with the Minister for Finance of the day but, until they have had experience in ministerial office, I do not think they really appreciate that the Department of Finance is not the same as other Departments.  It is because the Deputy <Col N="420" /> regards the entire Civil Service as being exactly the same that he considers that this committee would have a function.</P>
    <P>There are spending Departments and non-spending Departments and the non&mdash;spending Department consists of the Department of Finance, as the Deputy is aware.  As one of my colleagues in this House on one of the benches opposite said to me when I was appointed last June, the essential thing for a Minister for Finance is to know how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in every single language under the sun, parliamentary and unparliamentary.  I visualise that, if this committee had any function, Deputy Sheldon wants to interpose it as another basis like that.  I do not think that would have any use.  I move the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 10th November.</P>
