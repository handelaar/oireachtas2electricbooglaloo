   <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Taoiseach cannot be here this morning because of the workload associated with the Presidency of the European Union. However, I cannot understand why the T&aacute;naiste has consistently failed to turn up to represent the Government in the Chamber. I recall instances when previous Governments were in power when people went into hysterics because both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste were absent and the country could not be properly managed. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who represents the Executive this morning, should understand that, having travelled approximately 12,000 km around the country in the past few weeks, the extent of frustration and depth of feeling and anger among people is the most palpable I have ever seen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that we are dealing with questions to the Minister.</P>

	<P>We are dealing with Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He is entitled to say what he wants. Does the Chair want to take over that as well? We may as well close the place down.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny asked whether the Minister understood the frustration that exists. Is that not a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what type of protective mood the Chair is in this morning, but neither the Taoiseach nor the T&aacute;naiste is here. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has been handed a brief from which he will answer questions, one of which I would like to ask him now. People outside this House are talking about <Col N="1422"/>the arrogance, incompetence and broken promises of the Government. The Government promised 2,000 extra garda&iacute;, but none was delivered, it promised 200,000 medical cards, but none was delivered and it promised 3,000 hospital beds, but none was delivered. It wasted &euro;52 million of public money on electronic voting. The streets are not safe to walk. The old are left in despair and the young are without facilities. A shambles has been made of decentralisation. There is a despicable broken promise whereby the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe are to be allowed to walk the streets and probably canvass for some of the political parties.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the Government has no shame and that its programme for Government has been abandoned? How does he account for the fact that thousands of people talk about the litany of broken promises? Will the Minister tell the people why the Government has failed to live up to its word and has reneged on the promises given to the people when it bought their trust in 2002?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The people will tell the Government that on 11 June anyway.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I also have been out on the hustings and the people I have met are in a very buoyant mood.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What are they growing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>If matters were as bad as Deputy Kenny says they are, his party would be doing better in Dublin. Judging by this morning&rsquo;s opinion polls it has some questions to answer. There has been an outstanding performance by this economy and by workers here. The levels of employment and investment and the general performance of our economy will stand comparison with those of any country in either the EU or the OECD.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is despite the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is spending too much time abroad.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The record will show categorically &mdash; it will show it in Cork South-West as well &mdash; that this country is performing well. In the first five years we met our targets and surpassed many of them. We are only half way through this term and we will meet our targets in this term as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have a bet with the Minister on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to note that the Minister&rsquo;s opinion is that people are very buoyant. In discussing issues with people on the doorsteps in Dublin, one Fianna F&aacute;il candidate <Col N="1423"/>had difficulty in remembering what countries joined the European Union on 1 May.</P>
    <P>If the Government has met all its targets, will the Minister explain why it has failed to reduce waiting lists, why it has not delivered 2,000 extra garda&iacute;, why it has broken its promise to provide 200,000 medical cards, why it has not delivered 3,000 extra hospital beds, why the Minister present failed on the nitrates directive and on live exports and made a shambles of decentralisation? The imminent announcement of decentralisation to Portlaoise is not valid, according to the Minister&rsquo;s staff. Workers from other Departments are being given preference and the 50 the Minister mentioned are not even included in the decentralisation programme. How can he stand up here and say the Government has met its targets when it has proven itself to be the worst ever Government in the past 50 years?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Government kow-towing to the IRA?</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that Deputies leave it to their leader to ask supplementary questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that the key indicators of economic performance have all been met. They are outstanding and bear comparison with comparable economies anywhere in the OECD in terms of growth in double digit figures over the past decade, with employment creation at an average of 9%, which has increased the workforce from 1.2 million to 1.8 million, inflation in low single figures and investment at an all-time high, with &euro;43 billion in direct foreign investment into Ireland last year. I hope and expect that this level of performance will continue. We are only two years into a five-year term and I assure the House that we will match if not surpass the record achieved in the last term in office of this Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government goes on previous performance it will be in deep trouble.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the Minister&rsquo;s last statement as a threat.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced the closure of a number of long-established Garda stations and a number of suburban legal aid centres. Will the Minister for Agriculture and Food tell the House exactly what Garda stations and legal aid centres are involved? We are entitled to know because the Minister for Agriculture and Food will know better than most how this is undermining rural communities in particular, especially given the closure of post offices that is already under way.</P><Col N="1424"/>
    <P>Can I have the Minister&rsquo;s attention? Will he say which suburban law centres will be shut down? The head office has been transferred to Cahirciveen although virtually no staff transferred with it. However, I have discovered that there is a second head office in Dublin and the chief executive is there. He must travel to Cahirciveen with the director of legal aid and other senior staff when they wish to get certain business done. Is this the model that will be applied to decentralisation? The Government is engaged in the forcible relocation of 10,000 civil servants. Many of them have put roots down in this city and their children are being educated here. If the Minister for Defence had not got diplomatically ill this morning, I would have asked him about his forcible transfer of staff to a premises in Roscrea that is apparently owned by a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s two minutes have concluded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How can one reconcile the professed aspiration of decentralisation with the proposed shut-down of Garda stations and post offices? Look at the experiment where staff have been transferred. New staff had to be recruited to take up the positions. The Minister apparently intends to close some of the Garda stations in the areas of highest crime in Dublin. Which ones will close?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some experience of decentralisation because 75% of the Department of Agriculture and Food has been decentralised out of Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>How many were the result of the Minister&rsquo;s decision?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent decentralisation was to Johnstown Castle in Wexford and to Cavan and Castlebar.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not run Garda stations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of them run Garda stations?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised the question of decentralisation. It is intended that there will be further decentralisation under the current programme to Portlaoise. That has commenced already and will continue. It is voluntary. There is an implementation body under the chairmanship of Mr. Phil Flynn and it has produced its report. It will produce another report in July. Each Department has an implementation group and the decentralisation programme is monitored by the decentralisation group within each Department. The voluntary nature of the decentralisation programme is continuing.</P><Col N="1425"/>
    <P>The interesting aspect is that public statements are made, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, by party spokespeople while in the individual towns identified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer the question?</P>

   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;questions are being asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What occasion did the Minister offer for statements on decentralisation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Richard Bruton, this is a Labour Party question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no occasion whatever and no answers to questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to the Labour Party, Deputy Bruton should leave the questions to its Members.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as to what is being done about it, when it will start and when people will come down to those towns. With regard to the other question Deputy Rabbitte raised on Garda strength and the closure of Garda stations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What ones will have to close?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Garda strength is at an all-time high. If the Deputy has a specific question, he should put down a parliamentary question on the matter.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, with regard to the role of the Chair, the Chair might have been negligent this morning in that the Deputy asked two questions rather than one and, under Standing Order 26(3)(a), he is only entitled to ask one question on a topical issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I did not. I asked one question about Garda stations and I did not get an answer. I merely pointed out the conflict of closing rural Garda stations and post offices with a professed commitment to decentralisation. With all due respect, I will explain what I am asking without help from you.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with an unprecedented situation. The Ceann Comhairle should take note of the frustration felt by Deputies who are not receiving answers in the House. This must be remedied. The Ceann Comhairle has a role, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in requiring that questions are directly answered. I hope my question will be directly answered.</P>
    <P>The relocation of 10,000 civil servants to 51 different locations around the country has been mis-termed decentralisation. Whatever one calls it, will the promises made in this regard be complied with? I ask this question of the Minister for Agriculture and Food because I have before me the report of the decentralisation implementation group, which contains <Col N="1428"/>recommended deadlines for decisions and notification of civil servants about their future.</P>
    <P>The report states, for example, that information provided by Departments on business units, grades and staff numbers for transfer should be collated by the Department of Finance and signed off by each Secretary General for inclusion in the central applications facility, with a proposed deadline of mid-April 2004, and that fact sheets should be finalised for each of the 53 destination towns and placed on the website of the decentralising organisation, again by mid-April 2004. It refers also to the indicative time scales for the availability of accommodation. The deadline for responsibility of the OPW is the end of April 2004. It refers to the launch of the central applications facility being early May 2004 and the development and overall training plan, for which many civil servants have been waiting, as being the end of May. The end of May deadline, and the other deadlines, have all passed.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Apart from the political opportunism of dropping this bombshell in the budget speech, will the Minister for Agriculture and Food now say to more than 10,000 civil servants throughout the country who are wondering will they have to get a bedsit in Birr and travel back to Bray for the weekend to see their families, or go to Cavan to work for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that they will have the information before the local and European elections, or is it more cynicism politically to wait until the elections are over?</P>

	<P>Decentralisation is not a new project. It has been going on successfully for some years. I speak as a Minister of a Department where it is extremely successful. Some 75% of the staff of the Department have decentralised to different parts of the country, and decentralisation is continuing. The current programme is a coherent one and an implementation group has been set up. The Deputy referred to the first report of the implementation group. There will be a second report in July.</P>
    <P>The central applications facility is already on the website. People are encouraged to give the destination of their choice. The whole programme is voluntary and we expect it to be successful. I do not accept what I hear from spokesmen for different parties in Dublin who are opposing decentralisation while at local level in local towns they are demanding that the programme be expedited and accelerated. This is the height of hypocrisy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked why the deadlines of end of May for locations for child care facilities support services for those moving and individual implementation plans were announced. Civil servants are asking why the deadlines they were promised will not be complied with and the Minister has not answered the question. He referred to his Department&rsquo;s plans which are a total shambles. He is talking about moving the Department of Agriculture and Food laboratories from Model Farm Road to Macroom. People <Col N="1430"/>living within six kilometres of the laboratories will have to drive to Macroom in the morning and drive back in the evening. This is not decentralisation, it is increasing the burden and stress on families. Is he expecting people to move to Macroom from Model Farm Road?</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I expect you to insist on an answer from the Minister. While deadlines were given and people are expecting to have to make plans for their families and themselves, are these deadlines now broken? Is it the case that this will not be announced until after the local and European elections and does it not indicate what a shambles and cynical exercise it is?</P>

	<P>On the one hand, the cant on the doorsteps in Dublin is that the Government is bulldozing civil servants out of Dublin and, on the other, we are now being told we are not doing it quickly enough. If the Deputy took the time to access the websites of any of the Departments or State bodies he would get an update on exactly what is happening. The overall implementation group published its first report and it will publish its second report. Each Department and State agency has an implementation committee.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office issued the 13th and final volume of the 2002 Census of Population on 22 April 2004. The report covered housing characteristics and the following are the highlights. Approximately 197,000 dwellings, representing 15% of the total housing stock of 1.28 million dwellings occupied at the time of the census, were built in the intercensal period 1996 to 2002. This represents <Col N="1432"/>an annual average of close to 33,000 dwellings compared with 19,000 in the previous five year period. The 2002 census identified 110,000 occupied flats or apartments, representing 8.6% of all dwelling types &mdash; up from 6.5% in 1991. A third of these apartments were built since 1991.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>Apartment living, however, varied considerably from county to county. Dublin city, at 29%, had the highest proportion while south Dublin, at 2.6%, had the lowest proportion. Owner occupied dwellings continue to have the most prevalent occupancy status. While the number of such dwellings increased by 22.7%, from 807,000 to 991,000 between 1991 and 2002, their share of all housing units actually fell from 80.2% to 77.4% &mdash; the first time such a decline was recorded in recent decades.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>The number of private rented dwellings almost doubled from 71,000 to 141,000 between 1991 and 2002, following declines observed during the previous 30 years. One in nine dwellings at State level are now rented privately. More than three-quarters of private dwellings had five or more rooms in 2002, while the corresponding proportion was 40% in 1961. However, the census results contain some evidence of increased numbers of one, two and three roomed dwellings being built since 1991 following falls during the previous three decades.</P>
    <P>Of the 1.28 million dwellings in the State, more than 400,000 made use of individual septic tanks in 2002. Most of them, 94%, were in rural areas where more than three quarters of dwellings use this method of sewage disposal. A further 19% made use of public schemes. In urban areas, 93% of dwellings were serviced by public schemes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Central Statistics Office on the achievement of the goal, which it set out in its statement of strategy for 2001-03, to disseminate the full range of census results within two years of census day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear what the Minister is saying about apartments and one bedroom dwellings and so on. Does she not feel there is a need to look more closely at what is happening in reality? Apartments are being built without provision for children and without facilities for raising a family. A great deal of social deprivation will be created due to difficulties people will have raising children in premises built essentially for short term profit for those building them. Can the Minister give figures on the number of children being reared in the apartments referred to and compare the figures she has given to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area which clearly state that there should be building in the metropolitan area, but only local growth should occur in Wicklow, Kildare and Meath?</P>
    <P>Is it not the case that the strategic plan has failed, given that a quarter of all housing stock in counties Meath and Kildare was built between 1996 and 2002? The Government has no intention to ensure compliance with strategic planning guidelines. With all our talk on decentralisation, <Col N="1433"/>it does not sound as if the Government is doing anything to counteract the concentration of population in the Dublin area.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He did it very well, but that does not interfere with my right to ask a supplementary question.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The relevant question on the Central Statistics Office was on the figures for the children. Those statistics are not available in the census report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case will the Minister be mindful of the need for those figures to give a more accurate reflection of the nature and quality of family life of people living in those areas, and the sustainability of those residential areas?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When I answer questions on statistics, Deputy Sargent frequently asks me questions on quality of life. May I dare suggest yet again that it is not possible to determine quality of life on a statistical basis?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a point of order. It is on a question asked about the type of statistics that have been collected by the Central Statistics <Col N="1434"/>Office. Surely such a question is in order and there should be a response to it. If certain types of statistics are not being collected, the Deputy is entitled to ask why they are not being collected and what the Minister intends to do with the Central Statistics Office to make sure that such statistics are collected in the future. That answer has not been given.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Members confine themselves to asking supplementary questions relative to statistics rather than drifting into policy, perhaps it would be clearer for everyone in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>A relevant answer would be useful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent frequently asks questions about quality of life. This is a very important issue, but it cannot be determined statistically in a census. As the Deputy will be aware, prior to the beginning of the census or the publication of the final document, a pilot project takes place which incorporates some of the questions which can finally end up on the census form. A similar pilot project took place in April. Some of those questions will be used. Anybody and everybody is invited to make submissions about the type of questions they feel should be on the census form. I know Deputy Sargent has been involved in one of them as we discussed it here before.</P>
    <P>The questions on this housing report are already very specific and deal with the type of accommodation a household occupies, when it was first built, the nature of the occupancy and so on. It is quite detailed regarding the type of property and its age, as that was the focus of that census. In future the census will be able to deal with other issues. This one also dealt with the number of those houses which had Internet access, a question which would not have been anticipated ten years ago. Different questions come on to the census form and I know that the general public is invited to make submissions as to what those questions should be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there any statistics on apartment living, which as we know is expanding? Is the CSO keeping statistics on the number of apartments being purchased in blocks by landlords, or being retained by developers that are then rented to tenants, many of whom are highly transient? Due to  apartment block purchasing, for instance in many suburban areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy please ask the question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have statistics on the percentage of apartment blocks which are now landlord owned? Does she have statistics on the clusters of apartments owned by property developers and builders, which are being held <Col N="1435"/>and let to transient tenants, leading to a lack of community building and so on? Owner occupiers, young couples who buy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine herself to questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle. This is a new social phenomenon around our towns and cities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question deals purely with statistics.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I want to know if the CSO is capturing this important change. The number of apartments owned by landlords and the clusters of apartments owned by property developers which are held in groups make up to 60% of new apartment block developments in cities and towns.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The statistics which have been gathered are those which I read out from the 2002 census. There are 110,000 occupied flats and apartments, which represents 8.6% of all dwelling types. One third of them have been built since 1997. It is significant that Ireland at 77.4% has one of the highest owner occupancy rates in the EU surpassed only by Greece and Spain. Despite the fact that undoubtedly there is an increase in the number of people living in flats and apartments, that seems to indicate that the ownership rate is still much higher than all of our counterparts in Europe apart from two.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s answer is helpful up to a point. The point about new apartment blocks in recent times is that over 70% of them are investor or developer owned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a statistic. Has the Deputy got a question for the Minister?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister agree to look for those statistics? We need to know the number of landlords and extent of cluster ownership of these apartments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The question relates to the census. The census is a statement of where individual people are on a particular night. In this case it was Sunday, 28 April 2002. The information, therefore, is as I have outlined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the information supplied by the public to the census, what are the returned figures on rented dwellings and how do they compare to rented dwellings registered with local authorities? Did the census highlight those figures, in other words, the level of compliance by owners of rented dwellings with the regulation that they should register with local authorities?</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1436"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry but I do not understand the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The census shows the number of rented dwellings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that figure match the figure for rented dwellings registered with local authorities, which would indicate the level of compliance with the regulations in place regarding the registration of rented dwellings with local authorities?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy should table a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a matter for the Central Statistics Office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Minister&rsquo;s figures &mdash; my question is entirely statistical &mdash; if we take the total volume of households from the census and the total number of owner occupied dwellings there is a difficulty with the figures. My question is straightforward. Is it the Minister&rsquo;s conclusion that from the form as structured it is impossible to discern the ownership pattern for accommodation? The Minister of State said she can identify the number of people who are renting and those who are owner occupied. I have a difficulty in that these figures do not stack up.</P>
    <P>If we want to identify, say, the degree of multiple ownership, that is, the people who owned four or five houses five or six years ago and who own 20 today, the census offers no guide on that. In the revision of the form, and regarding the people who are the registered owners, is the Minister in a position to state the degree to which multiple ownership has become a dominating pattern in apartment and house purchase or is a separate survey required to identify the new landlordism in Ireland?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The question asked on the census is helpful and while it may not address all the points the Deputy raised it gives us some indication. People were asked the type of accommodation their household occupies. The basic answer was given, whether it was detached, semi-detached etc. On the question as to the nature of occupancy of the household&rsquo;s accommodation, the options were owner-occupied where loan or mortgage repayments are being made, owner occupied where no loan or mortgage repayments are being made, being purchased from a local authority under a tenant purchase scheme, rented from a local authority, rented unfurnished other than from a local authority, rented furnished or part furnished other than from a local authority and occupied free of rent as in the case of a caretaker or company official. The information that has been gleaned from these questions is useful because <Col N="1437"/>the questions were specific. As far as I am aware, the Deputy got a copy of the census report. If not, I can ensure he gets the full table.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be helpful in asking if it is not in the public interest that we should know the changed nature of ownership because it arises in regard to tax, policy and so on, in other words, the people who have the number of houses they own multiplied by three or four from that information, which is very confusing. I suspect, for example, that some of the landlordism is buried in the alleged owner occupancy side for tax benefits. How will the Minister of State identify the degree of speculative ownership? If it cannot be done from that census, does it require an entirely separate investigation in the public interest?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good question but I am not sure it can be answered under the census, the reason being that we are asking an individual about his or her position. To get the information Deputy Higgins is requesting would almost envisage asking a tenant if he or she knew how many other houses the landlord owns&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which would not be for the tenant to answer because he or she can only do that on the census form.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A pilot survey could be done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The information would have to be gleaned from the landlords themselves. How do we survey landlords, as it were?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They could register with local authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We could have a day of national confession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying it is inappropriate to do it. I do not believe it could be done under the census because we are asking the question of an individual in his or her own home.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is statistical but it is vital that we pursue Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s question. Many apartments are bought off the plans by investors and that is creating a new landlordism, as he said.</P>
    <P>I expect from the Minister&rsquo;s subsequent reply that my question is not a difficult one. She said the census is a measurement of the people on a particular night in various locations. In that case, is it not possible to find out from the number of apartments, about which I asked initially, how many children, either in terms of locations or even on average, live in those apartments, which in many cases were not built for children. They were built for a single person or a couple but no provision was made for children. Is it not possible <Col N="1438"/>to give us an indication whether children are being reared in those apartments?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is, all I can say is that for the purposes of this report, that information has not been extrapolated, except in regard to the number of persons rather than the age groups of those persons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State indicate if there is any intention to correlate the number of people who say they are living in rented accommodation with the numbers of apartments and flats registered with local authorities, and to use that information?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the function of the Central Statistics Office to correlate it with local authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the function of Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On that question, it is incredible that we know the numbers of people living in an apartment but we do not have a breakdown of the ages. Are we suggesting there could be four or five adults living in a one or two bedroom apartment? Is it not possible to know the ages? I understood the census contained a question on ages. Are we saying the information has not been collected or collated? Why is it not possible to indicate the number of children living in apartments?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>If that information is available it has not been extrapolated for the purpose of this report.</P>

In view of the Government&rsquo;s 67% tax take on oil prices and particularly in view of the strength of the euro against the US dollar, the universal oil trading currency, I call on the Government to make a significant contribution to controlling inflation by cancelling the 5 cent per litre oil price increase provided for in the 2004 budget.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 11, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders, back from committee; No. 12, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a Council framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking, back from committee; No. 13, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council creating a European order for payment procedure, back from committee; No. 14, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a Council framework decision on attacks against information systems, back from committee; No. 14<i>a</i>, motion re Standing Order 63A &mdash; procedure relating to removal of judge; No. 1, Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2004 [Seanad] &mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 14<i>b</i>, motion re Article 35.4 of the Constitution, to be taken after the announcement of matters under Standing Order 21(3) &mdash; approximately 3.45 p.m. &mdash; and the order shall resume thereafter; No. 19, Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003 &mdash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; and No. 21, Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 [Seanad] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 14<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate; the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 1: the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes; the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Private Members&rsquo; Business shall be No. 41, motion re rural development (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

	<P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, and 14<i>a</i> without debate agreed to?</P>

   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not object to the proposal regarding Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive. With regard to Nos. 14<i>a </i>and 14<i>b</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to intervene but I draw the attention of the House to the statement I made in recent weeks and again yesterday that to ensure the interests of the House and natural justice are best protected, Members should refrain from engaging in public comment or discussion. By doing so they could prejudice the decision of the House in the discharge of its obligations if called upon to do so at a later stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no intention of infringing that ruling. However, no comment is allowed on Nos. 14<i>a </i>or 14<i>b. </i>With regard to No. 14<i>b</i>, is the Government happy that the evidential material referred to in the motion, which appears to have been acquired unconstitutionally on foot of a warrant which was outdated, will be admissible to the committee which is to investigate the matter? Does the Government expect that a High Court writ will be issued today against this matter proceeding, either by No. 14<i>a </i>or No. 14<i>b</i>?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling and I seek clarification. I appreciate that we are in uncharted territory but it is important that the procedures we adopt are fair and proper. I also wished to ask about the possibility of court proceedings but Deputy Kenny has anticipated my question.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on two other points. Section (5) of the new Standing Order states: &ldquo;The Select Committee shall, at all times, give due regard to the constitutional principles of basic fairness of procedures and the requirements of natural constitutional justice.&rdquo; This issue arose in relation to a committee investigation of another case. How is it to be copperfastened?</P>
    <P>Section (9) refers to the right of the judge and his or her legal representative to be heard prior to any vote on a motion regarding Article 35.4.1o. Can it be specifically stated that the judge could be heard by the special committee? This is not stated in the Standing Order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that each Member be fully involved in this matter, regardless of the work of the special committee. That is the spirit in which the procedure is being approached. I would like clarification on that matter so that it is clear that this is a matter for the Oireachtas, as laid down. In that regard, what time is it expected will be needed for the procedure to take its course? Will that change, depending on legal action which may be taken by Judge Curtin&rsquo;s team?</P>

<Col N="1441"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal before the House refers to Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, and No. 14<i>a</i>.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On No. 14<i>a</i>, it is important that Members, who will subsequently be called upon to make a decision on this case, are fully informed of its detail and are not dependent on the report of a select number from within the body of the House. The Technical Group, which constitutes two political parties and Independents, will have only one nominee. There is a difficulty there. As an important decision is, perhaps, to be addressed, we are keen to ensure that all Members have full details and all explanations offered.</P>
    <P>Last week, we were requested to refer Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, to committee without debate. As a result of the number of committees, it is impossible for the Technical Group to cover each of them and we do not have representation on the committee dealing with these matters. However, we understand that only three of the four items have been addressed, and in a very short time. Furthermore, there has been no report to the House on the committee&rsquo;s deliberations. This has been promised continually in relation to these matters and has been done in the case of the European refugee fund, for example. With regard to these matters, however, there has been no report back. The Technical Group has no way of evaluating our questions and concerns and whether or not they have been addressed. They certainly have not been answered.</P>
    <P>No. 11 deals with matters which oblige us to recognise and execute confiscation orders issued in other member states. This can have serious consequences for citizens in this jurisdiction. I will not go through each of them individually but they are important matters. The process of addressing such EU-led propositions by the House is unsatisfactory. Matters are referred to committees which have little time and are already overburdened with 40% of legislation which goes through the House. This procedure is not practical. We must recognise that the way we conduct our business with regard to important matters which can seriously impinge on the rights of citizens means these issues not being addressed by the Houses. I have made this point on numerous occasions and I make it again today.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the propositions and enthusiastically support the motion referred to in No. 12. While I have some concerns regarding the detail of the motion I wish to see it progressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate these proposals. The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not debating the proposal. I make the point that I do not speak from a position of opposition to the motion but <Col N="1442"/>from a concern for the importance of proper scrutiny. That is the point I have made continually and I repeat it this morning in relation to Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a point of order regarding No. 14<i>b</i>. No. 14<i>a </i>is to be taken without debate. No. 14<i>b </i>is to be taken at 3.45 p.m. Will the Minister clarify what is proposed to happen at 3.45 p.m. Is it proposed to have a debate and, if so, what are the arrangements for such a debate?</P>
    <P>On a matter related to another forum, I understand a High Court writ has been issued. Does the Minister have information regarding any further steps that might have been taken on that writ?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In particular, has the Government received any information on the possibility of an application for an injunction?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo what has been said by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in regarding the four items back from committee on which there are no reports before the House. They are substantial issues. It was agreed that all material would be reflected in reports to be circulated to Members. It is not satisfactory for a person to have a report and not circulate it to the House.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if the Minister clarified how it is proposed to proceed on Nos. 14<i>a</i> and 14<i>b. </i> What information will be put before the House today and what are his views in terms of Members&rsquo; responses to it given this unprecedented step forward?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in moving the motion at 3.45 p.m. will address in detail the issues raised. I can assure Deputies that fair procedures will be observed. The steps being taken are unprecedented. I accept the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s admonishment that Members must be careful in any statements they make. The matter of composition of the committee will be dealt with tomorrow.</P>
    <P>On reporting procedures, I refer Deputies to subsection (8) of the motion which states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Following the completion of its proceedings, the Select Committee shall furnish a report of those proceedings to the D&aacute;il, together with appropriate transcripts and associated audio-visual material. Provided that the Committee shall first send its report to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, who shall arrange in the first instance for the report to be circulated to the members of the D&aacute;il and to the Judge who is the subject matter of an Article 35.4.1 motion. Provided further that the D&aacute;il may subsequently order <Col N="1443"/>that the report be published and laid before the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Yesterday evening, the Taoiseach reported that the Secretary General to the Government had the previous day received another letter from Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors indicating they had instructions to commence legal proceedings on behalf of the judge against the State. It is still the case that the Government has not had sight of any proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors have stated to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office that they intend to serve, later today, a plenary summons and statement of claim.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On whom will it be served?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not yet know what will be the content of the proceedings. However, the Government is satisfied, in light of legal advice received from the Attorney General and senior counsel, that the procedures it proposes to adopt are constitutionally sound. To date no court order has been made that prevents this House running its intended course. That is what we intend to do.</P>
    <P>The Government Whip will today propose the amendment of Standing Orders by the introduction of a new Standing Order which will facilitate a process pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will later propose to the House a motion calling for the removal of Judge Curtin. The Leader of the Seanad will shortly afterwards propose an identical motion in that House. The process previously outlined by the Taoiseach will then officially commence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach reported last week, in the context of that process, that in a letter dated 21 May 2004, Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors had requested of him an opportunity to make submissions on the motions which it was envisaged would apply in this matter. In a letter dated 25 May 2004, the Secretary General to the Government outlined to Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors the proposed scope of the process in great detail. On Monday, a short letter was received from the solicitors in which they suggested submissions will not now be made to the Government but may be made to the Oireachtas. Other correspondence, concerning reports from the Garda Commissioner and the DPP, were received and replied to last week. Copies of all correspondence will be circulated to Members of both Houses in the context of the motions being considered.</P>
    <P>The removal of a judge is a solemn process provided for by law. It is a process of removal, not an impeachment, a term incorrectly used. That term is used at Article 12 of the Constitution <Col N="1444"/>regarding the President. The process we are undertaking is not a trial. There is, however, a duty to accord fair procedures. The past five weeks from 27 April have involved giving opportunities to Judge Curtin to make representations and submissions and to provide explanations. We have now reached a point where the matter is to be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the context of motions to be laid before them. The Government is satisfied it can proceed in the manner as outlined. Members queries will be dealt with by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform later today.</P>
    <P>The Government Whip will ensure that party Whips and justice spokespersons will be advised of all details regarding the motion to be discussed this afternoon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Deputy Kenny, I remind Members that a Member who contributes to today&rsquo;s debate on the motion will not be permitted to make another contribution on the matter when it comes back from committee. Members will be aware they can contribute only once on a motion. I will hear briefly from one member of each party and will then put the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. Is the Government satisfied that data and information received by the committee, when established, by way of material acquired from Judge Curtin&rsquo;s house on the basis of an out of date warrant will not be deemed as unconstitutionally acquired? Will that material be admissible to members of the committee?</P>
    <P>As regards No. 14<i>b</i>, will Opposition spokespersons on justice be in a position to reply to the motion tabled by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe have an opportunity to make a contribution in that regard if he so wishes? We have not been down this road before. A new Standing Order is to be introduced later today. If a Deputy from a particular party, or none, makes a contribution today and, during the course of committee proceedings, new evidence or details come to light which would warrant all Members to contribute on the matter to the best of their ability, then we should amend Standing Orders to provide that he or she be allowed to contribute more than once. A Member who contributes today by way of initial reaction should, on the basis of further details and discussion, be facilitated in making a further contribution when the committee reports on the matter given the duty of Members of the Oireachtas to deal with the removal, as distinct from the impeachment, of a judge. If we are to fulfil our constitutional duty in this regard, Standing Orders should be flexible <Col N="1445"/>in allowing for more than one contribution where that might be patently obvious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On whom is the court order being served? It is important we have that information.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no court order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a plenary summons.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know on whom it will be served.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too sure who is in charge. It is of concern to me that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is in charge of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has put her question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is of even greater concern when it turns out he is not in charge of the country. Will the Minister who is taking questions state if we know who the court order has been served upon?</P>
    <P>I will ask the rest of my questions before I am interrupted by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. We are all conscious of the seriousness of this business. I ask that we try to obtain clarification to ensure that the procedures are proper.</P>
    <P>On the statements being made, I concur with Deputy Kenny that we should consider changes to Standing Orders to ensure it will be possible to allow Members contribute for a second time as the process unfolds.</P>
    <P>In what capacity is the Minister proposing this motion? Is it as a Minister or on behalf of the D&aacute;il?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to speak on this because I feel it is eating into D&aacute;il time, but it is important that we receive clarification on the questions raised by the media on whether this is a Government or Oireachtas action or whether it is being taken against the Government or against the Oireachtas. If we are to challenge it, our language should be clear and every reference to this process should be accurate. I understand the proceedings are being taken on behalf of the Oireachtas rather than the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify the procedure in respect of the committee? I understand from information offered yesterday that those nominated to the committee are obliged to remain in service throughout the period of its session. This could last for an <Col N="1446"/>indefinite period. It is impossible to say for how long at this point. I understand that if a Member were to become ill or were for some other reason unable to attend the session, he or she might not be able to re-engage subsequently in the work of the committee. If more than one Member were to find themselves in such circumstances, the committee would not be able to proceed and it would have to be reconstituted. This is a little like the position in respect of a jury. These are serious questions on how the process will be conducted.</P>
    <P>It is a serious and important issue and therefore it is important that the House be fully informed as to how the procedure applying to the committee&rsquo;s examination of all the facts will be undertaken. There are concerns over the information offered yesterday and I ask the Minister to clarify the position to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is still the case that the Government has not had sight of any proceedings. However, I am informed that the solicitors of Mr. Justice Curtin have stated to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor that they intend to serve later today a plenary summons and statement of claim.</P>

	<P>We do not know because they have not been served yet. This afternoon, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will move a motion in this House and will outline the procedures in great detail. He and the Chief Whip are available for any briefing on any detail. The motion will then be adjourned to allow the committee to be established. The committee will be established tomorrow and it will carry out its work under the terms of reference under which it will be established by Standing Order.</P>

	<P>The position is similar to that on other motions. It will be discussed with the Whips and they will agree on how we should proceed. I have been told that the Whips have been in constant discussion on this matter. There has been unanimity regarding how we should proceed with this unique, solemn and grave matter. We must bear this in mind all the time.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation for the way in which matters have been dealt with. We want to ensure that fair procedures and due process are observed and that nothing will be done that would in any way prejudice the outcome of the decisions of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is the Houses of the Oireachtas that will ultimately make a decision on this matter.</P>

	<P>I promise I will not go on about it. The central issue in this matter is the admissibility of evidence and material collected in the house of Mr. Justice Curtin given that the search warrant was out of date, which appears to have been the case. Is the Government happy that this evidence is admissible to the committee and the Members of the Oireachtas? Again, I strongly recommend that because we have not been down this road before and because it is a solemn process involving grave responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&rdquo; So starts <i>Ulysses</i>, and I suspect that, as he progressed his way across Dublin, Mr. Bloom little thought that here today, almost 100 years later, we would be recollecting his epic saga. The reason I refer to this today is that if one were to look at the media coverage of this Bill, one might well infer that its sole purpose is to protect the exhibition &ldquo;James Joyce and Ulysses&rdquo; at the National Library of Ireland, which will open shortly and mark the centenary of Bloomsday. However, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to remove any doubt over section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, which provides that the right of making available a work to the public includes, <i>inter alia</i>, performing, showing or playing a copy of the work in public. In the context of the Act, work means, with some exceptions which do not affect the issue before us today, a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement of a published edition or an original database and includes a computer programme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that within section 40, the reference to &ldquo;showing&rdquo; was intended to cover audio-visual works, for example, the showing of a film. However, it has been suggested that the reference to &ldquo;showing&rdquo; effectively created a public exhibition right. This would mean that, for example, an artist could prevent the &ldquo;showing&rdquo; of his or her painting by a gallery.</P>
    <P>Last November, my Department held a meeting with a number of national cultural institutions. In a related submission, it was suggested to us that the showing of an original protected artwork in the permanent collection of a gallery could be a restricted act.</P><Col N="1453"/>
    <P>More recently, my Department took a call from one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading legal firms. It stated that it was acting on behalf of an exhibitor and indicated it was satisfied that the Act effectively created an exhibition right. It wondered whether this was the intention. It was advised that it was not intended to create such a right and that the Department was not aware of any particular problems which had arisen as a result of the provision which, of course, had not been tested. It suggested that the position was unsatisfactory and left exhibitors in a very difficult position. It opined that a rights-holder could force the closure of an exhibition. While I do not know what exhibitor they were acting for, I am aware it was not the National Library.</P>
    <P>An amendment to section 40 was one of a number of issues which we planned to address in the copyright area. However, given that many exhibitors may be faced with difficulties in this area, we have decided that rather than awaiting a suitable intellectual property vehicle, we should move to make the amendment now. Legislation is essentially about balance. Does our intellectual property legislation achieve this balance? Overall, it probably does, though the issue is complex, often with very good arguments on both sides. The issue is complicated by the nature of intellectual property law.</P>
    <P>Last month we welcomed ten new member states to the European Union and questions were understandably raised as to how the Union would function with so many around the table. It is now just over 30 years since we joined in 1973. At that time, our legislation was Irish in the sense that, generally, while we may have looked to how others addressed issues, we determined what went into our legislation. After we joined, of course, some of our legislation was determined by what was decided in Brussels. We were part of this process but obviously in many instances compromises had to be made.</P>
    <P>In the field of intellectual property matters were quite different. Here the international influence went further back, to the Paris Industrial Property Convention of 1883, and the Berne Copyright Convention of 1886. Both have been adapted many times since and both are now administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation. With 180 member states, the negotiation process is understandably slow and trying to reach agreement on issues which may be viewed quite differently by the member states, is not easy. However, I believe we have a sound intellectual property regime.</P>
    <P>While the rights given in copyright might be seen by some as going unnecessarily too far, one must consider what is involved. When Sherlock Holmes apparently fell to his death at the Reichenbach Falls, public outcry led Arthur Conan Doyle to resume the stories about the great detective, explaining how he had not actually fallen. Arthur Conan Doyle need not have resumed these stories and could, if he wished, have prevented any publication of his <Col N="1454"/>earlier stories, subject, of course, to any contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>TS Eliot spoke of <i>The Moonstone</i> as &ldquo;the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels.&rdquo; This was published in 1868, but applying today&rsquo;s copyright law to it would mean that Wilkie Collins would hold copyright in the novel, but not in the concept of the detective novel. Copyright protects the expression of the idea, not the idea itself. So while we might not have enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, other detectives could be and were written about. So these rights, while they might lessen our enjoyment in some instances, do not threaten our well being. For this reason, the law is slow to interfere in the enjoyment of these rights. In the case of patents, the position is different, with provision for compulsory licences, where such are deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>While I believe that section 40 does not create a public exhibition right, it is clear that if the counter view were to be found correct, the implications of potential legal actions by copyright holders would be very serious. They would have a bearing on a national basis on practically every gallery, exhibition centre, and any other relevant premises that display copyrighted works across the country. The need for this amending Bill is to remove doubt over the display of artistic and literary works and to allow for their continued display in line with the strategic and business objectives of the relevant institutions.</P>
    <P>We, as a nation, rightly have a great pride in our artistic and literary heritage. The diversity, originality and value of that heritage should in no way be compromised by an interruption of the basic right to display artistic and literary material to the public under appropriate conditions. It would be grossly unfair and unreasonable if the display of items could be hindered due to a right created unintentionally by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.</P>
    <P>While it may not be relevant to the field of copyright law, it is pertinent to point out that a copyright holder may ultimately benefit from the public display of works of art and literature. The interpretation of work by the professional staff of the institution displaying it makes it more accessible and attractive to the viewing public. The positive aspects of this process are sure to influence future consumption and income for the copyright holder.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to provide some specific examples. The National Museum of Ireland occasionally exhibits works still in copyright which it wishes to display in the context of a specific exhibition or theme. A clear example is the Eileen Gray exhibition at the National Museum at Collins Barracks. Eileen Gray was born in Brownswood, County Wexford, in 1878 and died in Paris in 1976. She was a painter, designer and architect who made a major contribution to early 20th century design. She occupies a unique and seminal position as the <Col N="1455"/>head of what we now recognise as the modern design movement.</P>
    <P>Eileen Gray is today celebrated worldwide due to her influence on designers and architects like the great Le Corbusier. The exhibition in the National Museum contains original materials which were her property including furniture, drawings, records, letters and personal memorabilia all of which was purchased for about &euro;1.25 million. While copyright in the drawings and written material lies elsewhere, it should not be permitted to inhibit the National Museum from displaying and interpreting this important part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>There are works on display in the National Gallery of Ireland which are considered to be important heritage items forming an integral part of the story of the progression of art in Ireland. These include works by Louis le Broquy, Paul Henry and Jack B. Yeats. A large percentage of works on display at the Irish Museum of Modern Art are by living or recently deceased artists. The role of the museum, which incorporates an award winning education and community department, could be severely hampered by the creation of an exhibition right.</P>
    <P>Claims of exhibition rights might inhibit the National Library in its plans to place the works of some of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest writers, including Sean O&rsquo;Casey, on display over the coming years. This is of particular concern in view of its development of new exhibition spaces to facilitate such events. An exhibition right would have a negative effect on the library&rsquo;s attempts to enhance its role as the repository of the world&rsquo;s largest collection of Irish documentary material. Only now is the library finally in a position to share more of its treasures with the public and to offer the public the most up-to-date interpretative facilities.</P>
    <P>The effects of an exhibition right would also be felt throughout the network of private galleries which form an important part of the Irish art industry. The absence of a right to display copyrighted works could seriously hamper the ability of galleries to engage with art dealers, art owners and art enthusiasts. In the long term, the effect would be to compromise hard-earned international reputations. Even exhibitions in local libraries could be undermined by doubts about the entitlement to display copyrighted materials. This would affect the many exhibitions organised by proactive local librarians across the country.</P>
    <P>An exhibition right might attach to literary and artistic works travelling to Ireland from abroad. When a work in respect of which copyright remains extant arrives in Ireland, it is often following lengthy and complex negotiations. An exhibition right might place the copyright owner in a position to bring an action against the public or private institution planning an exhibition. The effect of such actions on what are often short-term displays could be the avoidance altogether by institutions of exhibitions of this type thereby <Col N="1456"/>denying the public access to developing art. These are examples of scenarios which could arise though there might not be problems in individual cases. Where an institution purchases an item directly from the holder of the copyright, there should be no problem.</P>
    <P>Other rights are not affected though exhibitors may wish to reflect on steps to ensure that no right is not infringed. To avoid doubt, the Bill provides that no infringement of any right created by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 in respect of an artistic or literary work occurs by reason of the placing on display the work or a copy thereof in a place or premises to which members of the public have access. I stress that this amendment is for the avoidance of doubt. We are not seeking to change the current position. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been a Member for some years and have not previously seen the high volume of emergency legislation which has recently come before the House. Only five months into the year we are on our sixth unplanned emergency Bill. We began the year with the Immigration Bill and subsequently dealt with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill came before us in April while last week we were presented with three new Bills to deal with the Curtin case. Before us today is the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>The pattern is emerging that when there is a problem, the Government legislates its way out of it. That is not the correct way to do business. Many worthwhile and important Bills are not receiving the attention they should or being enacted with the speed they deserve, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, the Commissions of Investigation Bill and the disabilities Bill. These important Bills are being held up for months at a time.</P>
    <P>The Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill has its background not in the uncertainty of the law but in another Government blunder. In 2001, the Government paid &euro;12.6 million for originals of works by James Joyce which it now wishes to place on display. It is disingenuous to contend that the Bill is declaratory in nature and does no more than declare the law as it already stands when this is not the case. The 2000 Act is very clear. In section 37, it provides that to make a work available to the public is clearly within the prerogative of a copyright holder. Under section 41(<i>b</i>), making a work available includes showing it. Any attempt by the Government to place copyrighted works by Joyce on display would breach its own copyright laws. The Government was aware of this when it paid &euro;12.6 million for the works in question, which is why it has brought forward this amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not declaratory but makes a substantive change to our copyright laws. To spare the Government, which spent &euro;12.6 million <Col N="1457"/>to acquire something it cannot use, further embarrassment, Fine Gael and other Opposition parties and Members will support the Minister. To be honest would be a good starting point, but I do not want to make a political meal out of the Government&rsquo;s mess.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a tragedy if these works and others like them were to be kept from the Irish people. I wish to move a number of amendments on the remaining Stages to clarify various issues such as the definition of &ldquo;avoidance of doubt&rdquo; and the retrospective application of the legislation. While I support the measure, the Government should consider that emergency legislation has become the norm rather than the exception. I am strongly of the view that we should not legislate our way out of problems at every hand&rsquo;s turn, which is happening almost every month.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike the Minister of State who presented a literary<i> tour de force,</i> I regret deeply that I have not prepared a range of choice literary quotations to decorate the few comments I will make on the legislation. Perhaps, I regret not having the support staff the Minister has.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Bill before us from the briefing I received last week. This is a very brief enactment with a single purpose, which is why it was intriguing to hear the Minister of State contend that it was not about the James Joyce exhibition. If the legislation is not principally to do with that exhibition, it is certainly the reason we are having this discussion.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s view that the alarm bells have rung so amazingly late, after a very elaborate exhibition was organised to salute the memory of one of the greatest literary figures of the world, certainly one of the greatest literary figures the island of Ireland has ever produced. It is amazing that at the last minute a specific new legislative measure should have to be introduced in this House to avoid doubt about the legal right of the National Library to present State-owned original Joyce works. One would have expected that matter to have been examined by the State immediately on the acquisition of those works.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the legislation will have implications far beyond these holdings of the National Library. However, the reason the legislation is being introduced today, with a short time devoted to it and an expectation that it will be quickly passed, is that there is a serious legal doubt about the ability of the National Library to present these works, which are part of the heritage of the State, and this wonderful, important exhibition. More humility should have been shown on this matter in the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech in acknowledging the lacuna that existed there, rather than his bravado in asserting that everything is fine and that the legislation is being introduced only as a <Col N="1458"/>belt and braces proposition, which as Deputy Hogan says does not stand up to forensic scrutiny of the legal position. The Labour Party and I will nevertheless not seek to delay enactment of the legislation to close off a legal loophole which would have involved certain consequences for the important Joyce exhibition had it been taken advantage of by the copyright holders.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said we have a very good legal intellectual copyright regime, but I am not so sure. I would like the Minister of State to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to deal with the general framework within which we control intellectual property rights in this State, the progress regarding a common platform of intellectual copyright within the expanded European Union, and how the legal regime in this country and across the EU impacts on the growth potential of our State. Although we are primarily concerned about intellectual copyright in so far as the arts are concerned in the measure we are discussing, intellectual copyright goes well beyond that. It is fundamental to the future growth and development of our economy that we are modern in our approach and that we give justice to copyright holders but are flexible enough to ensure that the commercialisation of new intellectual property can be proceeded with in this State in a way that is not restrictive or in a way that is not restricted more than in competitor economies.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to address this issue at the conclusion of the debate. I hope he will first present his analysis of where we stand regarding the legal regime in this country and its impact on the commercialisation of intellectual copyright in this State <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our competitor nations. Will he let us know if there is an identified need for further legislative change in this area that goes well beyond the minor clarification, to use the Minister of State&rsquo;s words, or amendment that is proposed in the Bill?</P>
    <P>Because he has heard the direct report of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, the Minister of State will be aware of its visit to Canada last year. One of the purposes of the trip was to look at Canada&rsquo;s intellectual copyright regime, which has enabled some of its dynamic universities to develop a commercialisation arm in a way which provides a model to be looked at in some detail to see how we can turn some of the intellectual property generated in our cutting edge universities and colleges of technology into added commercial value for this State. This is a separate issue which I raise in this discussion because it is of vital interest to the development of our economy and to the maintenance of the cutting-edge technologies that have driven the economy in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I take no issue with the proposal before us though I would have preferred if it was presented with a little more humility. The role of libraries is germane to the discussion. Libraries are an extraordinary community resource. There has <Col N="1459"/>been an extraordinary development in the State-wide library network in the past five to ten years. Libraries are not just repositories of books which people take out and return within a week or a fortnight. For many communities, libraries are now a historical, cultural and artistic hub. We need to acknowledge that in a way we have not done up to now and allow libraries to develop to their full potential.</P>
    <P>The National Library is a unique institution, but despite the comments of the Minister in his Second Stage contribution, it is still daunting in terms of public access. Few people who are not scholars or readers or who have not been introduced to the National Library would find it easy to walk into the library and access what is available there. I am aware that the director of the National Library has in recent times made great strides towards addressing this issue, and much of the newer material in the library is available on its website through the Internet.</P>
    <P>Regarding physical access, however, it would be more likely for a foreign visitor to Ireland to be ushered into the library than for a Dubliner or a citizen of this State to walk in off the street. The website has provided greater access, but we should look again to see how we could make the treasures of the National Library more accessible physically and make the extraordinary depth of scholarship available in the library available to a wider Irish audience than is currently the case. I am not criticising those who do a superb job in the National Library institutions, and I know that this issue is not the prime responsibility of the Minister of State who will be responding to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope we will enact this legislation. I hope that the James Joyce and <i>Ulysses</i> exhibition at the National Library will be a remarkable success and will be one of the appropriate markers of the centenary of Bloomsday, an iconic celebration of the literary traditions of this very literate nation.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Morgan and Twomey.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan pointed out in his contribution that at least six emergency Bills have been produced by the Government in this year alone. Since the beginning of the 29th D&aacute;il close on a dozen emergency Bills have been introduced. There was also other legislation, such as the planning amendment Bill at the end of 2002, the Bill in which we changed the law relating to domestic violence because of a court decision. While some of the emergency legislation was unavoidable because of court decisions, Bills such as the Electoral (Amendment) Bill and other legislation was due to Government policies being pursued in a wrong way. This is the emergency legislation with which the Government is seeking to correct legislation which it brought before the House. The Bill was passed by the Oireachtas in 2000 by the same Minister who is seeking to put in place this amendment Bill.</P>

	<P>It is emergency legislation. The Minister of State can call it what he likes. However, the Bill is obviously linked to the Joyce exhibition at the National Library. While it has wider ramifications, this does not deprive it of its surreal aspect. There has often been talk in this centenary year of the setting of <i>Ulysses</i> of what a walk around Dublin would be like in 2004. While I suspect it might take a visit to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to hear Members discussing legislation like this to find out, I wonder what James Joyce would make of it.</P><Col N="1461"/>
    <P>As a means of illustrating the national canon to the wider public, the Bill will not be opposed by my party. However, there are other copyright issues which the 2000 Act failed to properly tackle. It is unfortunate that we are introducing a very short amendment Bill to deal with one aspect inconvenient to the Government rather than considering the wider aspect of copyright law. For example, debate is ongoing about the sale of original work by visual artists where the benefit and added value goes to the buyer of the work rather than the artist. The idea of royalties for painters is a copyright issue that could and should be dealt with in legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>This also applies to royalties and copyright in a musical context. In recent years, people have appended their name to music without having had anything to do with its production &mdash; I am thinking of the Louis Walshs of this world, who claim to be songwriters and performers. An issue also arises in regard to the way royalties for music are divided between performers, writers and record companies and promoters. Consumers are being ripped off in this area because they are being charged for having the right to own these works of art. A question arises as to who should benefit in this area.</P>
    <P>A proper debate on copyright would address all the issues and it is unfortunate the Government has chosen not to do so. My party reluctantly supports the Bill and looks forward to proper legislation coming before the House in due course.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the introduction of the legislation which seeks to clarify section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. The uncertainty which arose in regard to section 40 has caused a significant level of difficulty for museums and art galleries. The amendment of the legislation will uphold the public interest and clear up the misunderstanding which has arisen in regard to copyright legislation in the State.</P>
    <P>It is refreshing to see the Government bring forward legislation in a speedy manner. It raises questions as to why the same could not be done with other legislation such as the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 and the long-promised ground rents Bill. The Government does not fully appreciate the anxiety and financial strain the ground rent issue causes to those whose leases are about to run out. It is a pity legislation on this issue could not be brought forward with equal speed.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that section 40 of the 2000 Act could be used to restrict the showing of an original protected artwork in the permanent collection of a gallery or display of manuscripts by the State. This would mean that an artist who had sold his or her work could subsequently prevent the showing of his or her painting or original manuscript by a gallery or museum. The most prominent case where this uncertainty related to section 40 has emerged is in regard to <Col N="1462"/>the threat hanging over the upcoming James Joyce and <i>Ulysses</i> exhibition at the National Library, which is part of the Bloomsday centenary celebrations.</P>
    <P>While understanding the desirability of the swift passage of this legislation, it would have been prudent to take this opportunity to transpose EU Directive 2001/84/EC on the resale right for the benefit of the author of the original artwork, which is due to be transposed, in any event, on 1 January 2006. The transposition of this directive would address the dissatisfaction which has been raised by artists that they do not benefit from a subsequent sale of their painting at a possibly much higher price than they receive when their artwork is first sold.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening remarks referred mainly to detective-type novels. If his back-up team would like the names of some broader thinkers, I recommend that writers such as James Connolly and Bobby Sands be added to the list. I am sure this would enlighten many Members on the benches opposite.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is being rushed through to fit in with an upcoming exhibition. However, copyright is an important issue, not only in the context of intellectual copyright but also other copyrights which are constantly developing. During the debate on the Finance Bill in 2004, a whole section was dedicated to giving tax concessions to those who develop new systems in biotechnology and IT. Given that copyright was considered for tax concessions, a significant value has been put on new developments happening at present.</P>
    <P>This debate is in the context of one exhibition on State property. Will the legislation need further amendment next year if others challenge other copyrights? While such challenges might not refer to intellectual property rights, which have been alluded to by other Members in regard to the visual arts, there may also be problems with other types of copyrights and property rights.</P>
    <P>Given that this problem has arisen so soon after the introduction of the original legislation, perhaps we should reconsider it in its entirety so that we do not have to regularly rush through emergency legislation on other copyright issues. This issue is not that significant although it could have been embarrassing for the Government if one of its exhibitions had been held up due to copyright. However, we need to consider all the relevant legislation so that we are not just fire-walling when copyright protection issues arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that much of our legislation relates back to the 19th century. This is a matter we must consider because copyright is becoming important and sizeable costs and profits are associated with it. The ownership of music copyright can earn an individual millions of euro and we must ensure a problem of this nature does not arise again, particularly if it can affect the economy.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Hogan, Howlin, Boyle, Morgan and Twomey for the contributions and their support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short but it removes a doubt that had potentially serious consequences. Deputy Hogan may be correct in his interpretation but it is my belief that clarity is required. When we transposed the final elements of the information society directive earlier this year, most of it had already been included in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. We undertook detailed consultation and many of the comments received were more pertinent to the Act than to the directive. We are now examining those comments to see what further changes to the Act are warranted.</P>
    <P>Already, however, we have identified some areas where some change is desirable and I expect we will have another opportunity to discuss copyright in the House and in the committee, as suggested by Deputy Howlin. I agree with him that much of the work done in the universities in the past is increasingly being dealt with on a commercial basis. Universities increasingly address the importance of protection and commercialisation of intellectual property and that will benefit the country.</P>
    <P>The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 contains 376 sections so it is not surprising that as it is being applied, rights holders and users identify problems in certain areas. Since that Act was implemented questions have been asked about problems that have arisen, the matter raised by the grandson of James Joyce among them. That is the reason behind this Bill, contrary to what Deputy Boyle thinks. The matter was being examined but because it became such an immediate issue, it was decided not wait for the further changes we intend to make to the Act. I can also assure Deputy Twomey that artistic works are covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed. We will revisit the area in the near future and I will consider Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s proposal.</P>

	<P>Section 40, which provides for the making available of a work to the public including,<i> inter alia</i>, performing, showing or playing a copy of the work in public, does not create public exhibition rights. Suggestions have been made that the reference to showing might create an exhibition right, allowing a rights holder to prohibit the exhibition of a work such as a painting or a manuscript. As I explained, the reference to showing was intended to cover audio-visual works such as films. The fact that these suggestions had been made, however, creates an element of uncertainty. That is why we are making this change to make clear what was intended.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes any doubt as to the meaning of section 40. To accept the amendment would lead to the inference that we intended to change the law and that was never our intention.

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (6) lays down the general principle that before the Ombudsman can consider a complaint the consumer must have given the financial service provider concerned a reasonable opportunity to deal with it. This is as it should be. The aim is that financial service providers should avoid causes for complaint and when complaints are made make a real effort to deal with them in a way that is satisfactory to their customers. If one examines the legislation as a whole and the particular sections, one can see clearly where they fit into the scheme and context of this Bill. In Section 57BX one will see that section 6 as drafted is an integral part of the overall scheme of how complaints are conducted. I am authorised to say that subsection does apply to the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Richard Bruton seeks to include the words &ldquo;and in the case of a Credit Union has made reasonable efforts to use fully the dispute resolution options which are available to the consumer as a member of the Union&rdquo;. Deputy Burton tabled a similar amendment. Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also referred to the exhaustion of all dispute resolution options available to a complainant under the credit union rules.</P>
    <P>The substance of this is included in the more abstract language of subsection (6) which provides that a consumer is not entitled to make a complaint unless the consumer has previously communicated its substance to the regulated financial service provider concerned and has given that financial service provider a reasonable opportunity to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is to be much commended for having such detailed procedures in place in its internal rules and that very much protects its position under the new subsection (6). However, when drafting legislation, it must have general application. I join in the tributes which other Deputies have made to the credit union movement. The Minister had very detailed discussions with the credit union movement about the substance of this Bill. It does not mean that one must include it by express reference in every subsection of the Bill. The Bill, as drafted, meets any legitimate concerns it has. One cannot after subsection (6) state that as well as covering every financial institution it also covers the credit union movement. Clearly the language of section 6 as drafted covers that. It provides that any financial service provider, including a credit union, should have a reasonable opportunity to deal with matters. What constitutes a reasonable effort is something the Ombudsman would examine in co-operation with IFSRA&rsquo;s consumer director.</P>
    <P>Clearly the fact that the credit union movement has a detailed code on this matter is very much in support of its position. It has already gone to the trouble of laying down a detailed internal code on this matter, and there will be a <Col N="1466"/>presumption in favour of that, although the Ombudsman can review these codes or determine that they should be improved in certain respects. I am not clear on the position in other financial institutions, whether their codes are as well developed. I suspect they are not. The position regarding credit unions is that they are fully protected.</P>
    <P>I hope complaints against credit unions are few, given that their customers are also members. For the same reason every effort can be made by a credit union to settle complaints in preference to going to the Ombudsman. However, if a consumer is not happy with the way the credit union has dealt with the complaint that person, having exhausted the internal procedures of the credit union, has the same right as a customer of any other financial institution to have a complaint dealt with by the Ombudsman within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies can appreciate that I cannot accept amendments that would prevent a consumer from bringing a complaint to the Ombudsman until unspecified dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am willing to accept that the Minister&rsquo;s interpretation of subsection (6) will mean that members of credit unions must have made reasonable efforts to use the dispute resolution machinery within the credit union movement. On the basis of the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that this will in practice protect credit unions and that the rules of membership must be availed of before having recourse to the Ombudsman, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 53, in the names of the Minister for Finance and Deputy R. Bruton, arises out of committee proceedings. Amendments Nos. 54, 56 and 66 are related. Amendments Nos. 53, 54, 56 and 66 will be discussed together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 41, line 44, to delete &ldquo;and the Regulatory Authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These amendments address concerns expressed by the present voluntary ombudsman schemes that giving information on individual complaints to the regulatory authority might be seen as compromising the confidentiality of such complaints. The regulatory authority is satisfied the provisions of section 57CQ for co-operation between the Ombudsman and the regulatory authority as strengthened by amendment No. 66, will give it sufficient information to permit it to adequately discharge its statutory consumer protection mandate.</P>
    <P>The new power proposed for the authority to require the Ombudsman to provide it with specific information is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the <Col N="1467"/>elimination of the present requirement that copies of all complaints and of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s decision on them be automatically copied to the regulator. We must remember that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and, if necessary, to direct that a financial institution compensates such an individual. It is the authority&rsquo;s responsibility and specifically that if its Consumer Director to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers. The authority will also now have the power to penalise financial institutions in cases where their actions breach regulatory requirements. It is important that the authority be able to draw on information available to the Ombudsman for dealing with individual complaints. It is not possible to be explicit on what information might be required. For example, it would be important that the Consumer Director be alerted at an early stage to emerging problems so that they can be addressed by the issue of codes or regulatory directions. Such information might also be needed in connection with the authority&rsquo;s use of its new sanctioning powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied the arrangements provided for by these amendments strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, respecting the necessary autonomy of the Ombudsman and on the other, ensuring that the authority can discharge its consumer protection functions in a way that draws on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s experience.</P>
    <P>The amendments were put to the Department of Finance by the regulatory authority as an agreed package following consultation between the authority and the existing ombudsman schemes. The authority is satisfied this gives all the power it needs to discharge its responsibilities. The important issue is that consumer complaints are dealt with promptly by the ombudsmen and that the consumer benefits from a virtuous cycle whereby complaints are judged against standards laid down by the regulator and in turn these complaints influence those standards in a way that benefits the consumer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad this amendment is being made. It is important that privacy be protected when someone makes a complaint. When a complaint is made to an ombudsman, that is where it should lie.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the Minister up on an issue he raised. It relates to what happens when a consumer complaint unearths malpractice. We have seen in recent days that consumers could be the victims of malpractice that occurred not only within the past six years but even further back. Where a complaint relates to malpractice dating back a long time and has only recently been uncovered, what is the system for alerting the <Col N="1468"/>regulator, the Revenue and whoever else must investigate it? That is the first issue.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The second relates to what happens regarding the consumer who made the complaint. On a strict reading of the Bill, the consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the event occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. However, if the consumer only discovered the malpractice in the past 12 months but the malpractice predated it by more than six years, would the consumer still have his or her complaint heard by the ombudsman and hope to get a reasonable settlement or will malpractices that date back a considerable period be deemed to be outside the remit of the ombudsman?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows more about common law than I but is it not correct that if one only discovers a malpractice now, under ordinary law it can have occurred more than six years ago? Am I correct that the restriction to six years applies to the discovery rather than the act? Will the Minister of State respond to these issues? The first relates to ensuring that malpractices are notified and that there is a communication system, without necessarily naming the complainant, which gets to grips with the malpractices. We need to provide protection for the consumer whereby if a malpractice comes to light and they make a complaint, their complaint, because it was only discovered within a period of six years, can be adjudicated by the ombudsman even though the event occurred more than six years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Bruton welcomes the substance of the amendment. However, I have bad news in respect of the time limit. The Bill provides that the consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. The key word is &ldquo;occurred&rdquo;. If it occurred more than six years ago, one cannot go to the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The regulatory authority can examine conduct which occurred before the six year period and recommend a code of practice on such conduct. However, the jurisdiction of the ombudsman is limited.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has that been done?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the balance struck in the legislation. That is the time limit for a complaint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The malpractice we are seeing now only came to light recently. It has alerted the Oireachtas more sharply to this matter than when the Bill was discussed on Committee Stage. That is the difficulty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there is a point in that regard and we will have to reflect on it. In the general law there has always been this difficulty with the Statute of Limitations and when the <Col N="1469"/>injury becomes apparent. Divergent judicial opinion has been expressed on that. This legislation is clear in that it refers to the event having occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. It does not mention it coming to light or one becoming aware of it. I accept the Deputy has a point and I undertake to have the matter re-examined before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This could be partially addressed by giving power to the regulator to refer a complaint, regardless of the time lapse. Take the example, as happened this week, of matters coming into the public domain which refer, as do many of the recent disclosures at Allied Irish Banks, to events that occurred more than ten years ago. In the foreign exchange overcharging scandal, much of the overcharging occurred outside this Statute of Limitations period which is the concept the Minister of State is applying. I assume the concept is partly based on that and also on the desire for finality with regard to certain events. We are aware that people can get caught up in complaint situations that go on for years and can become vexatious.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, however, much of what has been disclosed about recent financial scandals, particularly those in AIB, relates to matters that occurred more than ten years ago. AIB has said in its public statements that it will make restitution voluntarily to the people who have suffered, provided they can be identified. Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and I were confident from the start, given our knowledge of banking, that identification of a high percentage of the currency transactions which were overcharged was highly achievable. Subsequently, AIB and the regulator have indicated that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it remains the case that while the people subject to the foreign exchange overcharges will be recompensed voluntarily by AIB, and I understand that the regulator will also have the power to do this, there is also the right of an individual who was so wronged or overcharged by the bank to make a complaint. Aside from being reimbursed, they might wish to make a complaint. The Minister&rsquo;s most recent amendments changed the Bill significantly and this is one of the issues about which I complained. He made a number of the penalties or sanctions discretionary. He also said that if the banks admitted to the fault, a discretionary and contractual arrangement can be entered into between the financial services regulator and the offending financial services institution.</P>
    <P>That is fine and dandy, but for the individual who was the subject of the wrongful act by the bank, personal compensation for the money lost might not be the full issue. They might wish to pursue a complaint. In the context of this week&rsquo;s events, the six year limit is unnecessarily short, especially in view of the trawl by the Revenue Commissioners. They wrote to more than 120 people whose names cropped up in a trawl of <Col N="1470"/>people who had overseas accounts which appear to give rise to tax issues. Many of these people are tax compliant because they legitimately held those accounts. A number, however, are not. Many of them are elderly and we have heard on the Joe Duffy programme and many others the distress caused to them and their families. In some cases, the account holders are deceased and this has caused distress to their heirs.</P>
    <P>The banks say they settled their responsibilities to the Revenue Commissioners via the DIRT and other inquiries and made significant settlements in some cases. However, the individual customer, who might be an elderly person and who, rather like Mrs. Scanlon, expected their bank to look after them, accepted its advice and put their money in a bogus non-resident account, is now facing heavy penalties. Since all this occurred more than six years ago, they will not be able to pursue a complaint to the ombudsman when this legislation is enacted. The complaint they would pursue would be, I assume, that they were consciously and negligently misdirected by the bank into a product which had serious tax implications, was not in line with tax law and about which they were not advised.</P>
    <P>The problem with the ombudsman scheme is that such people are obviously barred. The regulator and the Revenue Commissioners are not barred but the individual elderly lady or gentleman is. I know the Minister is a fair-minded person. The banks can be addressed through the system but there should be recourse for individuals. Many of these people were encouraged to avail of non-resident accounts, although we do not know by whom. Perhaps they were encouraged by counter clerks who were receiving bonuses. People did not run into the Bank of Ireland in Blanchardstown and ask for a bogus non-resident account. They did not even know of such a thing. It was a matter of a word in the ear. Customers were told that the bank knew of a way of getting a good rate of interest.</P>
    <P>These people are definitely liable to refund the tax evaded, plus whatever penalties are due to the Revenue Commissioners. However, they should also be given &mdash; although they have not been so far &mdash; recourse in the matter of the banking structures that put them in this pickle. In any fair system, they should have some redress. If a patient suffered in this way at the hands of a medical practitioner he would have recourse to the courts. I hope by the time this Bill goes to the Seanad the Minister and his officials will have thought this out and decided that individual customers should be allowed redress.</P>

	<P>It is important to bear in mind that a person may complain to the regulator about a matter that occurred more than six years ago and the regulator may take it up with the institution. That facility is still there.</P>

<Col N="1471"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was glad to hear Deputy Burton acknowledge that. It is also important to remember that the ombudsman must have his or her own system. Six years is the normal and reasonable compromise that has been inserted in the pensions legislation for the pensions ombudsman, so this time limit did not fall out of the sky. There is a balance to be struck. The ombudsman must be allowed to run his or her office. As Deputy Burton acknowledged, complaints can go back a long time. There must be some reasonable limitation.</P>
    <P>In the AIB case, the regulator ordered refunds using moral suasion. This legislation expressly provides the power to do that. I do not agree, although this is not directly related to the Bill, that the statute of limitations necessarily bars claims arising out of the recent saga. There are many intricacies in how the statute applies to old accounts and the question of whether there has been movement in the account for many years. There are also claims and contracts involved. The issue is not clear-cut. There is a clear-cut provision in the legislation, however, and the regulator will be empowered.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was advanced by Deputy Burton that a discretionary power should be given to the regulator to enable him or her to filter cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>

    <P FLI="0">We went through the detail of the arguments for this change on Committee Stage, but I will briefly refer to them again. As we know, the recourse of appeal to the District Court is already provided for in legislation relating to credit unions. This Bill prescribes recourse to a court of higher standing, the High Court.</P>
    <P>This is an inconsistency. All legislation should refer in the first instance to the District Court. This is important because of the matter of affordability. People cannot, as a rule, afford to go to the High Court. Many people will be debarred from seeking referral to the courts in exercise of their right of appeal against the findings of the Financial Services Ombudsman. We must ensure that legislation accommodates the interest of the consumer and, importantly, that justice is available to the least well off in our society, as it is to those who can afford to buy their way to having their cases heard.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the importance of affordability. We cannot place obstacles in the way of people seeking to exercise their right of recourse to the courts. I recommend to the Minister that he accept the proposal, as presented in amendments Nos. 58 to 63, inclusive, to substitute &ldquo;District Court&rdquo; for &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;, and, as in amendment No. 64, to delete &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;. In this way we can ensure equity of opportunity to all citizens, which the Bill as presented clearly does not. People have the right to have their cases heard.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about how the courts may judge cases that are presented to them. However, there will undoubtedly be a significant drawing of breath on the part of many who may wish to have their cases referred if they find out that the High Court is the first court to which they can address the matter. I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendments and to recognise that equality of opportunity and access to the law is the constitutional right of every citizen. We should ensure this is upheld in this legislation rather than placing obstacles in the path of the referral of any finding of the office of the financial ombudsman. I recommend these amendments to the Minister and hope he will accept them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments, although I understand his motivation. Chapter 6 seeks to establish a judicial appeals procedure for the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Deputy referred to the Constitution, but the High Court is the constitutional forum to which citizens have a right to have recourse. The District Court is a court of local and limited jurisdiction, while the High Court is a national court. The District Court sits in many different districts around the State transacting a great volume of business of a general character, such as routine criminal matters, road traffic offences, minor civil claims and certain matrimonial proceedings. The district judge sits in an assigned district or, in the case <Col N="1473"/>of Dublin, a number of judges are assigned to a metropolitan district. Clearly, substantial unevenness and inconsistency would develop in the application of the law if appeals to the District Court were to be permitted. It is important to realise that what is at stake is an appeal against a question of law being referred by the ombudsman to the courts. The High Court is uniquely qualified to make authoritative pronouncements on matters of law. It is not envisaged that there will be a substantial number of appeals from the ombudsman. It is important if they take place that they do so before the forum, which is the authoritative exponent of the law in the State. While I commend district judges on the enormous volume of business they must transact, it is not an appropriate forum for an appeal on a difficult question of financial practice and management on an application by the ombudsman under legislation of this character. Such an appeal would come at the end of a process where a complaint had been examined by the institution&rsquo;s internal dispute settlement procedure. There would then be an attempt by the ombudsman to mediate and, finally, there would be a formal determination by the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The precedent set in the pensions legislation was that the High Court should review the ombudsman&rsquo;s final determination, which is appropriate. It must be done out of respect for the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, a position which is being created in the legislation. If the appointment of the ombudsman is to be reversed, it should be reversed by the court established under the Constitution to make authoritative pronouncements on issues of law. It should not be left to the vagaries of decision-making in a wide multiplicity of District Courts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the spirit with which the amendment was tabled, namely, that justice should be accessible and decentralised as far as practicable. However, there must be a consistency in the application of the legislation and I do not believe that consistency would be secured if I accepted the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be corrected because, unfortunately, I do not have the salient notes from my earlier presentation. I recall in the credit union legislation that recourse is prescribed through the District Court as the court in the first instance. I am trying to establish that this should be reflected across the board. The credit union movement is incorporated within the legislation. The legislation would have deleterious effect in regard to what is being provided for in terms of disputes arising from within the credit union sector. I understand the District Court is the court that was prescribed in that case. Is it being suggested that this only satisfies a certain level of financial interest, that it is just a particular sector of society that can have its business or financial issues and differences dealt with at that level, while across the rest of the financial services <Col N="1474"/>sector, the High Court is the appropriate body? The Minister of State should look again at this aspect because I do not have the material with me today to confirm for certain, but this is what I recall from my preparation for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to the importance of evenness and consistency. Is he not reflecting a questionable view of the exercise of law and justice at District Court level? Surely all our courts should operate on the basis of evenness and consistency. I would be concerned if the Minister, who has a professional interest in the area of the courts, took the view that the District Courts do not apply evenness and consistency in terms of their judgments across the jurisdiction. They are not autonomous independent courts, they are part of the entire judicial system and process. Surely evenness and consistency is what is expected and required before the law for all citizens. I would be concerned at that response and the inferences that could be drawn from it.</P>
    <P>The High Court is a very prohibitive course for many citizens to take when one recognises that one is taking a case not against the finding of the Financial Services Ombudsman <i>per se</i>, but the financial institution against whom the complaint is made. Taking on a financial institution through the court system is a formidable and prohibitive process. What hope would one have taking on that process in the High Court, where the financial institutions can buy the finest judicial brains in the land? I again emphasise that we should consider approval of the District Court as the first court of referral on the basis of its affordability. I reject the notion of its unevenness or inconsistency. It is well placed to make an initial judgment call. It is a testing ground if a further appeal is required. I have accommodated this aspect in amendment No. 64 where further reference to the High Court is offered. This just relates to a point of law.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State understands why I make the case but I fear he will not accommodate what is in my view a very reasonable proposition, which is designed to secure the equal rights of all citizens before the law. Sadly and regrettably, recourse to the High Court has become the preserve of those who can afford to lose a case. Most citizens would be financially ruined if they did not succeed. This is a huge impediment and obstacle, and invariably people will not take that course. The financial institutions will be able to buy their way through the system because the fear of taking them on at High Court level will be the great impediment to justice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not like the Deputy to be under the misapprehension that I was suggesting that in general the District Court is inconsistent in its decision-making process. As I pointed out, the District Court must conduct a vast amount of business, much of which is of the same character. We are dealing here with the <Col N="1475"/>Financial Services Ombudsman. The ombudsman is the specialist in this area. He or she is the person who will constantly deal with financial institutions, building up a picture of the type of complaint he or she receives, making determinations about it, seeking to mediate in the first instance and then making determinations.</P>
    <P>An appeal against the ombudsman in the context of the legislation is entirely different from the type of high volume business the District Court routinely transacts. This is the point I was seeking to make to the Deputy, not that the District Court is inconsistent in its decision-making procedures, but that it might become inconsistent when faced with a specialised ombudsman in very detailed financial matters, where infrequent appeals will be taken. The ombudsman will build up confidence among consumers and recipients of financial services because he or she will have his or her volume of expertise. When an appeal is by a bank against a consumer, the ombudsman can be involved. In the case of a consumer who does not have means, the ombudsman will stand over his or her determination and protect the consumer. This position is safeguarded in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The appeal in this instance must be an appeal to a specialised tribunal. As I said in my reply to the Deputy, the High Court is the tribunal that authoritatively lays down the law in this country. While there can be an appeal against the determination as well as on a point of law, the nature of an appeal in this context will be very much based on legal grounds, not a fresh fight as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in appears to insinuate.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the position regarding the contact he has made with local authorities about the serious lack of planning enforcement by a number of local authorities as set out in a recent television programme (details supplied); if extra resources will be made available to local authorities to ensure that planning enforcement is effective; and if the matter has been discussed with the <Col N="1476"/>association of city and county managers.</Quest>
     <QRef>[16761/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A major concern behind the revision of the planning code which occurred in 2000 was to ensure increased compliance with planning law, in response to complaints about failures in the planning enforcement system from both individuals and local authorities. The introduction of a culture of enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 greatly simplified the existing statutory provisions to make it easier for planning authorities to take enforcement action in cases of breaches in the planning code. The Act also made a number of significant improvements to the enforcement provisions for persons who make complaints, in particular that all well founded complaints must be investigated by the planning authority and that complainants must be told of the progress of their complaint. The Act also contains special provisions relating to certain issues that were difficult to address through the normal enforcement process, including applications by persons who have repeatedly breached previous planning permissions, unfinished housing estates and quarries.</P>
    <P>While these provisions set out a strong legal framework for planning authorities to take enforcement action where necessary, statutory responsibility for the operation of the planning code is vested in each individual planning authority. Decisions on enforcement in particular cases are, therefore, matters for the planning authorities in question.</P>
    <P>My Department has been concerned in recent years to ensure that planning authorities have sufficient resources available to them to carry out their functions under the Planning Act. The Department has assisted planning authorities in the recruitment of planning staff by sanctioning additional planning posts, by liaising with the education sector on ways of training more planners and, as an interim measure, by assisting with the recruitment of planners from abroad. The latest figures provided by planning authorities show that there were a total of 1,567 staff, professional, technical and administrative, employed in planning departments in the county and city councils in March 2004. This is an increase of 43% over the numbers employed three years ago. The 2000 Act also allows planning authorities to recoup the cost of each enforcement action directly from the developer and to benefit from any fines imposed by the courts.</P>
    <P>Part VIII was commenced on 11 March 2002. While it is early to establish its impact on the overall level of enforcement activity by planning authorities, preliminary figures on enforcement actions by planning authorities in 2003 indicate <Col N="1477"/>that there has been an increase in the level of convictions, as compared to 2002.</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y" el="5" FLI="0">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P el="0">The Ombudsman in her recent report also acknowledged that there appears to have been some improvement in local authority performance on enforcement generally, although she noted that it is too early to make an accurate assessment based on performance over a period of less than two years since the introduction of the Act.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep under review the implementation of the enforcement provisions of the 2000 Act. Issues such as enforcement are regularly raised through the formal consultation mechanism established between the city and county managers association and my Department, and I will continue to press planning authorities to improve their performance on planning enforcement. I also welcome the statement by the Ombudsman that she intends to continue to monitor whether the Act is being properly and fully utilised and to be proactive in protecting public confidence in the planning system.</P></Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree this is not just a local problem, but rather a major national problem? The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme to which I referred in my question highlighted very serious breaches of planning laws which seem to go unchallenged by local authorities. This occurs through a lack of commitment or will in some cases or through a lack of resources in other cases due to the pressure on planning departments. The Minister stated that there was a 40% increase in personnel in planning departments. However, does he not agree that the programme highlighted serious breaches of planning laws? These have done irreversible damage to the environment in the areas concerned, have degraded the quality of life for many people and in many cases highlighted a &ldquo;David versus Goliath&rdquo; tussle between millionaire developers and individuals who had to put up their own resources to challenge the breaches in the courts.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that this is unsatisfactory and that he must bear responsibility for the problem? Will he give details of the steps the EU is taking against us as a result of our failure to deal with so many unauthorised quarries and mining developments throughout the country and which were the subject of a number of issues raised by that programme?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal in detail with the quarry issue in another question.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general point the Deputy has made. As Minister, I would not stand over lack of enforcement or implementation of the law. I believe the Deputy was involved in many of the discussions on the Planning Act 2000, which brought in many important new measures. Those <Col N="1478"/>measures are only being put in place throughout the country at the moment. I would not accept that there is widespread disregard for the law. Many people tell me that the law is implemented too harshly. However, the Deputy is right when he says that any flagrant breaches of the law cannot and should not be tolerated. The number of prosecutions rose substantially from 2002, when there were only 32 convictions, to 137 convictions in 2003. That is a substantial increase, which is the effect of the legislation passed by the Houses and the implementation of Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important that local authorities exercise their statutory duty in full and put much emphasis on enforcement. I provided substantial resources on a range of enforcement matters for local authorities. I expect them to use those resources, whether human or financial, to the absolute maximum to ensure compliance with the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister call in the managers of the authorities that were highlighted in that programme to get explanations from them on their failure to implement and enforce the planning laws? Has he considered introducing legislation to prevent those cowboys who breach planning laws from applying for and receiving planning permissions until such time as they apply the conditions on permissions already received?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always looking at ways to improve the law. There is no law in place that cannot be improved. Issues such as those the Deputy rightly raised and were raised in that programme represent areas in which we could improve planning law. I have asked my officials to do that. I meet the city and county managers association on a regular basis and I have spoken about these issues. In my last discussions with it I laid great emphasis on the range of enforcement that is required. It is not simply a matter of new laws passed by the Oireachtas. What we need is a lot more emphasis on enforcement on a range of issues within local authority areas. I will not be satisfied until I see those who degrade the environment stopped in that activity.</P>

<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 5 together.</P>
	<P>My Department continues to examine possible measures aimed at moderating land costs for housing and other essential public infrastructure. As part of this process, my Department is giving consideration to the report on ownership and control of building land, which was commissioned from Goodbody Economic Consultants, and to relevant recommendations in the Ninth Progress Report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, on the subject of property rights. The National Economic and Social Council is conducting a major study on housing and land policy and its report, which is expected to be finalised shortly, will also be very relevant in this regard. I intend to publish the Goodbody report in conjunction with the publication of the NESC report.</P>
	<P>I welcome the report of the all-party committee. I note its assessment that, having regard to modern case law, it is likely that the central recommendation of the 1973 Kenny report, namely, that land required for development by local authorities should be compulsorily acquired at existing use value plus 25%, would not be found to be unconstitutional. Based on this assessment, the committee has recommended that this &ldquo;designated area scheme&rdquo; should be re-examined with a view to its implementation following such modifications as are necessary or desirable in the light of later experience.</P>
	<P>The committee has also identified a number of different mechanisms that could be considered as an alternative to the designated area approach in order to recover betterment, including development levies, planning gain, and new taxation initiatives. Moreover, it has suggested that, notwithstanding its view on the constitutionality of the Kenny proposals, change along the lines recommended in 1996 by the Constitution Review Group may be desirable, that is, that existing constitutional provisions concerning property rights would be replaced by a single new provision. As I am sure the Deputy will agree, these are complex issues with significant implications for the role of public authorities and the operation of the building, and in particular the housing, markets. They merit, <Col N="1480"/>and are receiving, careful consideration by my Department.</P>
	<P>Meanwhile, the operation and future potential of Part V of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 2000 as a mechanism for the provision of social and affordable housing should be emphasised. Following its amendment in December 2002, activity under Part V has increased significantly. During 2003, 163 housing units were acquired, with nearly 1,900 units under construction or proposed on foot of Part V agreements; this compares with delivery of only 46 affordable units in 2002. A further significant increase in output under Part V is expected in 2004.</P>
     
 </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>In the week when we have been told the average price of a new house in Dublin has gone up to &euro;320,000, that is an obtuse reply from the Minister about the issue which is at the centre of high house prices, namely, the cost of building land.</P>
    <P>I have a number of specific questions arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply. First, when did he receive the Goodbody report on land hoarding, particularly in Dublin? Why is he now proposing to delay its publication until the NESC report is published? What is in the report that will cause discomfort to supporters of Fianna F&aacute;il that he is delaying its publication? Why will he not publish it immediately? Second, for anyone who has not read the report of the all-party committee it is useful that the Minister should summarise its contents for us but can he tell us what he intends to do about it? He told us that he welcomes the report. Does he accept the recommendations in the report and will he do anything about implementing them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I already told the Deputy and am happy to repeat, the report was received at the end of 2003. There is nothing in the Goodbody report that discommodes me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not publish it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy will let me answer I will tell him. The NESC is doing a major study on this issue &mdash; we referred it to NESC &mdash; and it is important that the two reports are published together. That would be helpful. We will then have the differing assessments, and I would be interested to see the NESC report on these issues, which are complex.</P>
    <P>I and I am sure all Members, appreciate the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which paves the way in one particular area for dealing with these issues. The NESC report, which should be published soon, is badly needed. I would be interested to see what is in the report, although I have no foreknowledge at this stage of its views on this issue, particularly in terms of land policy, its usability and availability and all the questions <Col N="1481"/>that surround that. We must have a factual discussion on these issues to come to conclusions.</P>
    <P>Even though there is not a simple pathway forward, based on some of the issues that have been signalled already, I am struck by the level of activity under Part V which I have seen while travelling throughout the country. That is beginning to bed down and managers and the various developers in different parts of the country are putting much better methodologies in place, which are speedier, and we can see from the figures what has actually been built and what is beginning to come through the system.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect I find difficult to understand. Ten days ago I opened an affordable housing scheme. It happened to be in Tramore, in my constituency, but no one would consider Tramore to be a poor or backward area. Property in the area can be very expensive but this affordable housing scheme consisted of three bedroom houses, with three bathrooms, the main bathroom being <i>en suite</i>. They had fine gardens and were finished extremely well, yet the price of each house was &euro;118,000. To say I was surprised at the value is to understate how I felt, particularly in terms of the quality of the houses which were built by a major national company, not a small local builder. I have opened other schemes throughout the country and the prices of those houses are &euro;138,000 and &euro;140,000, which leads to some questions.</P>
    <P>I am coming around to the view that in regard to this issue the problem is largely focused on Dublin &mdash; that was probably always the case &mdash; in terms of people getting housing here. I am aware in other county council areas, and Deputy Allen will be aware of this in Cork and other areas, that there was a shortage of people to take up the affordable houses being built. That is not common to particular areas; it happens throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We need a rational debate on this issue and what the Oireachtas committee has said points the way forward. I am enamoured by the view that where land is becoming available, it is vital that the local authorities&rsquo; land banks do not diminish and that we continue to enhance them, particularly for housing. If we do that, and the report highlights an existing land use value, plus 25%, to the local authorities, that would be extremely helpful throughout the country, not just in Dublin. If the Deputy is asking me my view, I am certainly positively disposed to that. In fact, I believe it is necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister appears to be living in a cocoon. He has mentioned figures but I am aware that his PR people pumped up the issue of affordable houses being available but not being taken up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That did not come from me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that in Glenheights Road, Cork city, there were more than 400 <Col N="1482"/>applications for approximately 20 houses. That is the level of demand. If affordable houses were available, people would take them. That is the reality. The Minister should not believe everything he hears from his PR people.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that since his Government took office, house prices have trebled? Houses are now 25% more expensive here than in the United States yet the Minister abolished the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant, opposed development levies and increased VAT. There is now a 45% take by Government.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a simple question, although it will not be the answer to all the problems in the housing area. Why is he suppressing the report on land holding in the Dublin area? Last October in this House he promised that the report would be published at the end of the year but we are now into the month of June and the report is still being suppressed in that it is not being made available to Members of this House. We can examine the spectrum of factors involved in housing because it is the most crucial issue for economic development and social cohesion but Members of this House are not getting the full picture because reports available to the Minister are not being made available to us. Why is the Minister going back on his promise to make the report available so that we can judge whether or not there is exploitation of first-time buyers and of all house buyers by a small few? Let us get the full picture.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refute the suggestion that I am suppressing the report. I did the courtesy to the NESC, which is preparing a substantial report, of giving it sight of this report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>What about courtesy to the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The basis of the Deputy&rsquo;s supposition is that land hoarding is going on in Dublin. He might be surprised to see what is in some of the reports.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not publish the reports?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am anxious to publish this report. I have done the courtesy of showing the report to the NESC, which is preparing a major report on this area. So that we do not have just one view but an overall balanced view coming into the marketplace, it is better for the Oireachtas and those who are interested in the discussion nationally to see all the reports made available together. We should be able to do that shortly. That will lead an interesting debate on this area.</P>
    <P>There are many conflicting views, as Deputies know. I am sure Deputies Allen and Gilmore have been told that land hoarding is taking place, as I have been. I have also heard the that land hoarding is not taking place. A recent report, which was not carried out by my Department, said there was no land hoarding in Dublin and <Col N="1483"/>showed that the land bank in Dublin is held by 27 different developers. One could not describe 27 developers as four, five or six, as is the perception. We need to get to the root of the facts in these reports. That will help to point our way forward and to come to conclusions.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s point, which was previously made in the committee. There must be a basis for local authorities to acquire land at existing land use value plus approximately 25%, as the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has suggested. There is a solid basis for that. The upholding of Part V confirms that we will be within constitutional grounds to do that and that will play a useful role.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest to Deputy Allen that we have resolved all problems in this area and I did not mean to point specifically to Cork. There are areas where tremendous value is being given and other areas where we cannot build enough quickly enough. I accept that. We must strike a balance between the two.</P>
    <P>No more than the Deputies, I want to see the cost of housing reduced. People&rsquo;s incomes and costs have gone through the roof in recent years. I do not say that is a bad thing. People&rsquo;s standard of living and their earning capacity is enormous. However, as a percentage of people&rsquo;s disposable income, there is very little difference between house prices now and 20 years ago. Like me, most Deputies were caught at the time when interest rates reached 29% and 30% and nearly destroyed us all. Those rates were not sustained over a long period but rates of 14% and 15% were the norm when we were trying to buy houses years ago. It also took us some time to save 20% of the cost of a house to get an 80% mortgage. I do not say this as a justification for the way things are today but we must take a balanced view.</P>
    <P>We are building more than 72,000 new houses every year and the majority of them are being bought by first-time buyers. The funding is there to do that. I accept that we have a gap. People are falling between below the income level for a commercial mortgage and are above the level which qualifies them for social housing. We are trying to fill that gap by imaginative mechanisms. Part V is one of those. Other initiatives in that area will also be helpful.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Single people who are unable to provide housing for themselves from their own <Col N="1484"/>resources are entitled to apply for social housing which is provided by either a local authority or a voluntary housing body. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to single persons and other categories on their waiting lists in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities, my Department continues to advise local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been asked to submit action plans setting out their social and affordable housing programmes for the period 2004 to 2008. My Department expects to have these plans in draft form from all authorities over the coming weeks. Given the nature of continuous housing need, the preparation of these action plans will be beneficial to local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years and providing a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. My Department will be examining individual plans to ensure that they match the profile of needs in local authority areas. It is intended to agree activity levels with each local authority in the autumn of this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not need to come to the House to hear that reply from the Minister of State. When I raised this matter last November, I received exactly the same reply. I was preparing to make notes on what the Minister of State would tell me so that I could challenge him but he has given exactly the same reply as last November.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister of State what he is doing to house people on housing waiting lists. Of the 48,000 people on housing lists, 32% are single people. What is the Minister of State doing to reduce that number and to provide social housing for single people and particularly for single men, who are the biggest sector of that 32%?</P>
    <P>The Minster of State&rsquo;s reply means that nothing has been done in the past eight months. The crisis in the housing sector, particularly among single people and, more particularly, among single men, has got slightly worse and not better. Informing me of the letters being sent out to various housing authorities means nothing and is not an indication of measures taken. Will the Minister of State shorten his answer to informing the House of what he is doing about the crisis?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tried to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s questions. The housing budget for this year is &euro;1.88 billion. A few weeks ago, the local authority spend, which is approximately &euro;700 million, was announced. That will allow the needs of approximately 13,000 of the 48,000 people on the waiting lists to be met this year. They will <Col N="1485"/>include a number of single people. If 25% of the people on the lists are having their needs met, the number of single people housed may not be high, but these figures give an indication of what is being done.</P>
    <P>We are trying to break down the attitude among local authorities that they must build three-bedroom semi-detached houses. It takes a while to break down that attitude. When the new local authority action plans are submitted, they will be judged. When an authority establishes the housing needs of its area, my Department will examine its plans to see if they are in accordance with the needs of the people on its housing list. For families with five or six children we will want to see four bedroom houses, and if a local authority area has a large number of single people, we will want to see provision of suitable accommodation for them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister of State is suggesting that what he is doing constitutes action and is effective, will he inform the House how many single people have been accommodated under the actions he has taken? Can he furnish the House with figures or indicate any alleged success from what he is doing? Organisations which deal with homeless people highlight the lack of provision of social housing, specifically housing designed for single people, as one of the most severe hurdles in accommodating homeless people and enabling them to make the transition from emergency to permanent accommodation. Will the Minister of State provide the House with those figures?</P>
 
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 10% of all local authority housing allocations are to single persons. Given there are almost 7,500 to 8,000 direct allocations per year, approximately 750 or 800 single people are being accommodated each year. Also, approximately 1,800 units will be provided this year by way of voluntary housing, a growing sector. A much higher percentage of voluntary housing units are allocated to single people perhaps because many housing associations cater for elderly people and those with special needs. I do not have a specific percentage in that regard but it is much higher than the 10% provided by local authorities.</P>

     <Quest>if his Department is making financial provision for the measures needed to counteract some of the damaging effects of climate change in view of the fact that Dublin City Council alone estimates a need for &euro;150 million for coastal defence work and that the Chartered Insurance Institute world-wide says that with present trends, losses due to climate change will outstrip global GDP in 60 years.</Quest>
     <QRef>[16809/04]</QRef>
<Col N="1486"/>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is responsible for ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s coastal zone is used in a sustainable way to the best advantage of the Irish people from an economic, aquacultural, leisure, social and environmental perspective. In this regard, he requested in July 2002 all coastal local authorities to submit proposals for coastal protection works for the period 2003-06.</P>
    <P>From my perspective, the EPA published comprehensive research undertaken at NUI Maynooth in 2003 entitled, Climate Change: Scenarios and Impacts for Ireland. This identifies, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible implications of a sea level rise for Ireland and the impacts this may have. Major cities such as Dublin were seen to be most vulnerable from an economic perspective. The research specific to Ireland, and international policy analysis of the impacts of climate change through the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, will help inform long-term planning in coastal zone management and other policy areas to allow the expected impacts of climate change to be integrated into policy formulation and the costs of adaptation to be best managed.</P>
    <P>The prime global response to climate adaptation requirements is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to levels that would prevent dangerous human induced interference with global climate systems. The Kyoto Protocol is consequently important as a first step towards the necessary global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 60 to 70% by the end of this century, as identified by the IPCC. Achievement of these reductions will delay and reduce the damages caused by climate change and the need for adaptation and, will ensure that the global costs of adaptation will be lower than those identified in the report referred to.</P>
    <P>The IPCC third assessment report, the authoritative scientific perspective on climate change mitigation and adaptation, was not able to determine comprehensive quantitative estimates of the benefits of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations at various levels but is satisfied that stabilisation at lower concentrations will generate greater benefits in terms of less damage. It is also clear that the impacts of climate change will be greatest in those parts of the world least able to afford the cost of adaptation in the required time frames.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, my priority has been to support international efforts for ambitious targets for emissions and to meet these targets nationally.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to ask a question relating to the Kyoto Protocol because we are dealing with the extent to which climate change is already having an impact. The Minister is dealing only with the matter from an economic point of view given he stated Dublin was vulnerable for economic reasons. Given the costs associated with the floods two years ago of &euro;10 <Col N="1487"/>million on clean-up and &euro;2 million on damages, will the Minister act on European Commission research in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s likelihood to experience not just increased rainfall but, increased heavy rainfall and, likewise research from the Institution of Civil Engineers to which he may also have been referring in his reply given NUI was involved in the research which predicted a half metre rise in mean sea level in the next century?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister taking on board that advice which stresses the need for not just coastal local authorities but river-basin local authorities to erect considerable defence walls? It has been mentioned that Dublin would require a three metre defence wall. Will such projects be included in his Department&rsquo;s Estimates? In planning terms, will he take on board the retreat of clay cliffs in Killiney and the dunes at Portrane not alone in terms of existing flood plains but in terms of predictions of likely increases in flood damage in areas currently not affected from a planning point of view? To what extent is the Minister taking on board what is already happening regardless of our success or otherwise in enforcing the Kyoto protocol, which is another day&rsquo;s work. I believe the Minister appreciates that we must deal with what is happening now. Will such projects be included in his Department&rsquo;s Estimates?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, referred in his reply to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. To what extent can local authorities depend on the Government for assistance in terms of providing necessary defences against rain and flooding in particular?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will agree this is a complex area. Much of the impact referred to will not take place until the end of the current century from approximately 2075 to 2100. Plans are being put in place to deal with this issue. I am aware from time at OPW that climate change capacity was built into the various schemes designed to deal with the floods. Even though we had not reached existing impacts, significant allowance was made not alone for the worst case scenario that had ever occurred but for potential scenarios taking account of models in different parts of the world. Climate change has been directly catered for in the flooding schemes initiated in recent years.</P>
    <P>This is a much more complex issue with which to deal in terms of coastal areas. There is a threat to Ireland and many other countries in terms of how one mitigates this problem. Clearly, one can put in place various elements of coastal protection but, we could spend all the money in the world on this issue and still not resolve it. One has to deal with this matter in a targeted way. My Department is working with the local authorities in that regard.</P><Col N="1488"/>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department is currently rolling out the river basin management systems, some of which have already been completed. The systems will not alone manage the river basin but the entirety of issues in terms of what is happening to the water within those areas. This measure was seen by the EU as the way forward. Ireland is leading the way and, in that regard many schemes are already well advanced in different parts of the country. These schemes will throw up potential solutions to dealing with such problems. However, it will take a combination of Departments and local authorities to come up with agreed solutions to the problems. The question of finding the necessary resources arises, but resources are being made available to deal specifically with flooding issues and the erection of barriers to combat flooding. That is a wise decision.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall the major flooding incident some years ago whereby a new motorway was flooded while old roads were not. The NRA should have taken into account potential water levels and its ability to deal with them in extreme scenarios. With road levels, in terms of the topography of an area in which road is being built, such issues should also be taken into account. We have asked the NRA to ensure that is done in future. There is no excuse for the failure of the development, planning and construction sectors to take into account existing impacts and potential future impacts. That is the best way of getting value for money in terms of dealing with these issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue. Will the Minister say if his Department is currently engaged in discussions with some of the insurance companies which are threatening, and in some cases have already carried out such threats, to withhold insurance cover on the basis of risk of flooding? Are attenuation tanks in new developments viewed as a critical factor in providing house insurance? Will the Department assist householders in existing and new developments in obtaining insurance cover? He will be aware that there are threats hanging over properties because of insurance companies withholding or threatening to withhold cover.</P>
    <P>Given the prediction of the Chartered Insurance Institute, is the Government liaising with insurance companies to ensure ongoing cover is available and that conditions are taken into account to ensure they are satisfied they will not have to withstand costs that will bring them down as companies? This is obviously what they are afraid of.</P>
   </Speaker><?oasys _cl10.5-?>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue largely concerns the Office of Public Works, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance. When I had this responsibility, I instigated an all-Ireland mapping and modelling process to identify potential dangers for local authorities and developments to ensure we would not build in areas that would obviously be prone <Col N="1489"/>to flooding, either now or in the future. That is important. It is equally important that people are able to insure their properties. There were instances in countries where there has been flooding in which people could not get insurance and had to seek alternative methods.</P>
    <P>I do not have information on the question on my Department&rsquo;s engagement to date, but if the Deputy tables a parliamentary question, I will certainly obtain it for him. Generally, the OPW, as the operational arm of the State, is more fundamentally engaged in this area on behalf of the State. It is doing a very good job.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Rabbitte</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the information available to his Department regarding the reported investigation by the EU into whether many quarries in this country are being worked illegally due to lack of planning permission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[16521/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002 the European Commission wrote to my Department about two specific quarries. Ireland provided a detailed response in both cases in early 2003 and there has been no further communication from the Commission in either case. There has been no correspondence from the Commission on a wider investigation by the EU into quarrying activity in Ireland, as was recently reported in the media.</P>
	<P>My Department recently provided the Commission with details of the new statutory provisions relating to quarries which came into effect with the commencement of section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on 28 April 2004. That section is intended to address concerns about the need for all in the quarrying industry to conform with modern environmental standards.</P>
	<P>Section 261 introduces a once-off system of registration for all quarries. It applies equally to quarries that have been operating before the planning system came into operation in 1964 and those operations begun since. Only quarries for which planning permission was granted in the past five years are excluded.</P>
	<P>Under the registration system, quarry operators must supply full details of their operations to the planning authority. Following registration, a planning authority can impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or may require such a quarry to apply for planning permission and submit an environmental impact statement in certain circumstances. Authorities will also be able to restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry which has received planning permission more than five years ago. <Col N="1490"/>Any quarry which is obliged to comply with section 261 and fails to do so within the appropriate period will become an unauthorised development, regardless of its previous status and, as such, may be subject to enforcement proceedings by the planning authority.</P>
	<P>The enactment of section 261 is intended to enable planning authorities to better regulate the operation of quarries in their area both by providing them with comprehensive information on such quarries and increasing their powers of control over quarrying operations as they expand. In parallel, my Department has issued comprehensive guidelines to planning authorities on quarrying and ancillary activities. They offer guidance to planning authorities on planning for the quarrying industry through the development plan and determining applications for planning permission. They also include a practical guide to the implementation of section 261. I am confident these guidelines will help ensure that quarrying in Ireland operates to the highest planning and environmental standards.</P>
</Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did it take four years to bring section 261 of the Planning and Development Act into effect? How many quarries have been registered since it came into effect on 28 April? The Minister stated the EU Commission is not conducting any investigation into quarrying in Ireland, which contradicts the newspaper reports to that effect. Is his Department conducting any investigation into the illegal operation of quarries in Ireland? Can he supply the House with an estimate of the number of quarries operating without appropriate planning permission?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the new registration system, as provided for in section 261, the detailed information required by relevant quarry operators was to be supplied by 27 April of next year. Therefore, we are well placed to meet the deadline. I dealt with this issue the minute I entered the Department. Quarrying is a huge business. It might surprise people that it is worth approximately &euro;20 billion to the Irish economy per year.</P>
    <P>We should have a balanced approach, ensure that we meet the environmental standards and give some of the industries a lead-in time to change their ways, as many did, to be able to conform to the new and much stricter regime. We must send a clear message to those who do not conform that they will be out of business; it is as simple as that. The industry will now be subjected to a quite sophisticated planning and enforcement regime. We have even approached quarries that came into being before 1964 and imposed conditions upon them, thus causing considerable angst.</P>
    <P>This problem has arisen only recently. I am aware of the point Deputy Allen made &mdash; I did not see the programme in question but I heard about it. The behaviour in question is obviously unacceptable. We have dealt with the two cases the Commission raised. It has not come back to on them so I take it that it is satisfied. The <Col N="1491"/>Commission has not corresponded with us in any way about any EU investigation into quarrying in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not have the answers to some of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions on the numbers involved, but if the figures are available I will obtain them for him. Given the timeframe for putting all the details together, I suspect they are not fully compiled by all the local authorities at this stage. We should deal with this issue.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only asking for an estimate. Since the Minister was in a position to give us an estimate on the economic value of quarrying, I presume he made some inquiries into the extent of non-compliance with planning regulations before he brought section 261 into operation. I am only asking that the Minister share this estimate with the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the information with me but I will get it for the Deputy. If I had it I would be quite happy to make it available to him. I had available to me the estimate of the total value of quarrying to the economy last year. I presume we do not have the one the Deputy requires because we probably have not received all the figures from the local authorities. As he knows, section 261 of the Planning and Development Act came into effect on 28 April, which is only a matter of weeks ago. As soon as I have the desired information, I will be quite happy to make it available to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree there is considerable concern among communities, particularly on the perimeter of Dublin, over illegal quarrying? A cumbersome system applies in the making of applications for quarrying whereby the operators have to apply for a waste permit to the EPA or the local authority, depending on the tonnage. In addition, they must apply to the local authority for planning permission. Communities are unaware of how to obtain information or make a submission. Will the Minister examine ways of streamlining the system?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that many quarries, which may have been quarrying illegally, were also used for illegal dumping? We have a difficulty in Wicklow in that respect.

	<P>It was expected that section 261 would be included and I would like some more detail on the matter. What would the Minister say to local authorities that have benefited from materials coming from unauthorised quarries? Is a particularly bad example not being given when material is coming from unauthorised quarries for local authority use? What has the Minister done, said or threatened in that regard?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with the points being made by the Opposition spokespersons. Like them, I want the issue resolved. Rightly or wrongly, quarries have operated for many years in a largely unregulated fashion. I did not seek to blame my predecessor for the delay in introducing this. I simply said that when I found this issue, it was very complex and difficult to deal with. I was determined that section 261 would be implemented one way or another. As often happens with groups that represent sectional interests in society, some might have thought the regime was too hard and people would be put out of business. Ultimately this needed to be done and has been done. We had up to April 2005 and the section was only implemented in the past six weeks. I expect changes in this area will be quite rapid.</P>
    <P>Deputies Timmins and Sargent are right in saying public consultations on these matters are important. We have assisted local authorities by giving good guidelines as to how to deal with the matter. Both through regulation and the law, we pointed out that it is incumbent on those operating quarries to have a good neighbourly policy and engage with the community. They must be open and explain to those living in proximity to quarries what is going on. The local authorities have an obligation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Now that the section has been implemented, I have no doubt that new incoming councillors will make themselves familiar with these regulations and will use the guidelines to ask their officials to advise them of the arrangements for registration, local consultation, the number of quarries registered, the assessment of illegal activities or those who have sought to stay outside the system and refuse to take part. A range of issues needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s point about the County Wicklow scenario, I have made &euro;7 million available to local authorities for enforcement this year to curb the illegal dumping of waste. I have also made substantial funds available to the Environmental Protection Agency and have established the new Office of Environmental Enforcement. We hope to see a substantial change and I hope the days of illegally burying waste are over.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the progress made to date in the review of the retail planning guidelines relating to floor space cap on retail warehouses; when he expects the process to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[16511/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>

<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The retail planning guidelines prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 sq.m. gross retail floor-space for large-scale single retail warehouse development. This aspect of the guidelines has been under review, taking account of the need to ensure proper planning and sustainable development, while also supporting effective competition in this sector of retailing in <Col N="1494"/>the context of ongoing developments in retail formats. To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. Some 71 submissions were received and have been assessed. The submissions received raised many complex issues and these will be fully taken into account in considering further whether any changes are needed in the guidelines. I expect the process to be completed shortly at which point I will announce the outcome of the review.</P>
     </Speaker>
   
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That reply is almost verbatim the reply I received to the same question I asked on 27 April and 4 March. The review of the retail planning guidelines was announced in August 2003 and the 71 submissions to which the Minister referred have been with him for some time. Is it not the case that the Minister intends to lift the 6,000 sq. m. cap on gross retail floor space to facilitate in particular IKEA, which has made no secret of its wish to develop in the State, and he is delaying the announcement of this decision until after the local and European elections for fear of the outrage it will cause in the retail sector generally?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy would be entirely wrong if he thought that was my view.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see. Time will tell.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has nothing to do with the local elections. Having reviewed the submissions, as many organisations would like to see the cap lifted as would like to see it retained. There is no consensus. Two large bodies of opinion represent the views which are in conflict. Many issues feed into this matter, as the Deputy will be aware. It is not simply about expanding floor space. In addition, there are issues of location and traffic. The Deputy referred to one company whose operation I have seen abroad. The volume of car movements going into and out of some of its developments is incredible.</P>
    <P>I have not read any of the submissions yet as I am waiting for the assessments to be completed so that, along with my officials, I can read them. The Deputy&rsquo;s assessment of my view on this matter is wrong and I cannot allow that perception to prevail. I have an open mind on many matters and I will be interested to see the assessments. I do not come to this debate with any fixed position, especially the one the Deputy suggests.</P>
    <P>The matter is complex and will take some time to tease out in this House. We will wait and see. While it may be implicit in the way the Deputy posed the question, from being around the country more than most Deputies, it would appear to me that, by and large, these guidelines are working well. While I do not base that view on any scientific assessment, it is my sense that the very large stores, which would be substantially larger and probably would have made the arguments that they could not function under the constraints of the cap, seem to be <Col N="1495"/>functioning well within the guidelines and the scale seems to be appropriate. I will wait to see what arises over the summer. I am sure we will have a good debate in the autumn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said the submissions have been received in favour of and against lifting the cap on retail floor space. In his role, as Minister, does he feel he has any remit or responsibility to adjudicate on the basis of sustainability in this matter? Will increasing car dependency, to which he referred regarding other countries, be a factor in his decision? Outside the lobbying and submissions, does the Minister have a view rather than just adjudicating as to which is the heavier basket, that for or that against?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Time will tell just how right or wrong my suppositions are. Will the Minister indicate to the House when a decision is likely to be made on this matter? Given that we have been receiving similar replies on this issue for a number of months, is there a particular reason references to the national spatial strategy which appeared in the March version of the reply no longer appear in the April and June versions?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There certainly is not. The submission has not come to me and I do not have unlimited officials. Staff have been dealing with a range of issues in this area and it has been difficult to complete this process. There is no mystery. I am as anxious as the Deputy given that I initiated the process and would like to reach a conclusion.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with Deputy Sargent. It comes back to the spatial strategy point which I have made on a number of issues in this debate. There are many issues which feed into sustainability, one of which I have just enunciated while replying to Deputy Gilmore. Sustainability is clearly an issue when making decisions on traffic, for example. It is not a simple question of moving a cap from one figure to another. There could be very significant consequences of doing that. I have questioned publicly whether one should take initiatives in Dublin or try to encourage development in other parts of the country in a different way. There are many different avenues to explore under the spatial strategy and sustainability and I very much intend to take them into account in trying to come to a conclusion.</P>

     <Quest>if he will report on the progress of the implementation of the national climate change strategy.</Quest>
     <QRef>[16572/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>

<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</P>
	<P>Among the positive signals for the environment, the EPA report, Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2004, outlined a modest reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. Emissions are down from 31% above 1990 levels in 2001 to 29% above in 2002, which is the first reduction in a decade. Ireland is pursuing a challenging programme to limit the growth in greenhouse gas emissions through the vigorous implementation of the Government&rsquo;s national climate change strategy. The strategy sets out a systematic programme to meet our Kyoto obligations by 2012. I initiated a review of the implementation of the strategy to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. This process is ongoing and incorporates an update of greenhouse gas emissions projections with a particular emphasis on cross-cutting economic instruments to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto targets. These instruments include emissions trading and other flexible mechanisms which have continued to be developed at national, EU and international levels since the strategy was formulated.</P>
	<P>The Government is ensuring that Irish industry and the power generation sector can participate fully in EU emissions trading starting in January 2005. In this context, the EPA has submitted the national allocation plan to the European Commission for approval. The installations included in emissions trading produce approximately one third of Irish greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions trading will enable these sectors to meet their reduction obligations in the most economically efficient manner through access to least-cost emissions reduction opportunities across the EU and more widely.</P>
	<P>The study underpinning the development of the national allocation plan identified the overall national distance to target in the Kyoto period 2008 to 2012 at 9.2 million tonnes CO<?oasys _of8-?>2 equivalent per annum. Achieving reductions of 4.3 million tonnes CO<?oasys _of8-?>2 equivalent will be the responsibility of the emissions trading sector leaving reductions of 4.9 million tonnes CO<?oasys _of8-?>2 equivalent to be achieved within the rest of the economy. I am satisfied that 1.2 million tonnes CO<?oasys _of8-?>2 equivalent can be achieved within the sector of the economy outside emissions trading at or below a cost of &euro;10 per tonne of CO<?oasys _of8-?>2. The Government has indicated its intention to purchase 3.7 million allowances on the international market.</P>
	<P>I am currently advancing the review of the overall national climate change strategy to take account of the foregoing decisions and I intend to publish the outcome in due course. I am satisfied that full implementation of the revised strategy <Col N="1497"/>over the remainder of the decade will ensure that our Kyoto obligations will be fully met in the 2008 to 2012 period. This will occur in the context of the arrangements for emissions trading together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review.</P>
</Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11-?><Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Government&rsquo;s calculations in drawing up the national climate change strategy published in 2000, greenhouse gas emissions would be 23% above the 1990 level in 2004 if none of the recommended actions was taken. As greenhouse gas emissions are 29% above the 1990 level, does the Minister agree that the national climate change strategy is in tatters? It is worthless. The figures are completely askew and the situation is much worse than the Government projected even if the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach had been adopted. Is the Minister saying the State will simply buy its way out of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol while not even attempting to reduce emissions? Does the Minister agree that this irresponsible approach amounts to the State failing to play its part in the global fight to prevent climate change?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for putting down his question as this is an important albeit complex issue. I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s summation. He fails to say that the level of economic activity is way beyond what was anticipated when the figures were originally put in place. If one factors in the level of economic activity on which the 23% figure was based and compares it to the activity which is causing emission levels of 29% above the 1990 level, one will see that there is not an obvious correlation. The figure should be much higher. We are doing a great deal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>What are we doing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing an enormous amount. If the Deputy wishes me to spell it out for him, I will.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing nothing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The energy efficiency methodologies being used in the building trade are at the top end in European terms and will deliver substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions trading regime which is legitimate for Ireland and other countries to participate in is another mechanism which can be used.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is dumping responsibility on poorer countries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Equally, our movement away from an over-dependency on heavy fossil fuels is crucial. Changes are being made by businesses in all areas of the economy not simply by companies in the energy sector which are switching from heavy fuel oils to gas. While this is not the perfect <Col N="1498"/>scenario, it represents a significant improvement. The targeted number of wind energy systems has been exceeded in terms of planning system approvals. We will get them in place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not allowed to connect to the grid.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Denmark produces over 30% of its energy needs from wind which means we can and should do the same. This should not be an adversarial issue. It is something we are all trying to grapple with sensibly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to be adversarial.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland would not have been invited to chair the OECD forum in Paris on this issue, in which all countries participated, if we did not have credibility. We have credibility and we have a challenge. The figures are not hidden internationally and everyone knows what Ireland&rsquo;s challenges are. We must face them. We do not have a nuclear industry, which is what masks the issue in other countries that benefit from very low carbon emissions. I do not want nuclear energy and I am sure nobody else in this House does either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues appear to.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We should balance that against the serious challenges on the other side. I am not trying to minimise the seriousness of what we face. A strategy has been put in place which is fully operational in Ireland. For the first time the figures show that we are seeing the decoupling of economic activity and emissions. We must ensure that between 2008 to 2012 we hit our target of 13% above the 1990 levels. If everybody does what he or she is supposed to, we will.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that while Ireland is incurring a great deal of pain for very little gain on this issue, the United States of America is giving us two fingers in failing to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol? What discussions has the Minister had with US authorities in his capacity as President of the Council of Environment Ministers in Europe to convince them to discontinue their role as environmental vandals and to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I met and had discussions in Paris with Michael Leavitt, the newly appointed director of the EPA in the US who was appointed by President Bush. I also met the EPA representatives in the UN following on from that meeting. I agree with the Deputy that it would be better for the world and all of us if America were to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, but sadly under the present Administration that is unlikely to happen.</P><?oasys _cl11-?>
    <P>It would be foolish, however, for Ireland on that basis to do nothing because it is quite clear that more and more American states are now <Col N="1499"/>looking to the future and setting targets more difficult than Kyoto. We should ask ourselves why. I have been trying to say to Irish agricultural interests, to unions and to IBEC that we must end this debate quickly. We are trying to negotiate on the impact next week. We should be much cleverer in this country in looking at the potential opportunities in the medium to longer term. There are enormous opportunities in employment and in research and development with potentially huge benefits to the environment.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has previously acknowledged, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation environmentally is far better than that of many countries which are trying to rise to a certain level. That does not mean we should be complacent. We need a much wider debate in this country which is less adversarial in the immediate impact. We need to look to our serious medium to longer-term opportunities, and see where the opportunities lie for Ireland. There are enormous opportunities for agriculture and industry in this country, and for the creation and sustaining of very many jobs, if we handle this correctly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Pursuing the question raised by Deputy Allen, an EU-United States summit will take place at the end of this month in Ireland. Will the Minister say if the failure of the United States to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol is on the agenda for that summit?</P>

	<P>The Minister should know the answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s position on the environment, in leading the EU in its Presidency, is clear. The environmental issue has been and remains on the agenda. It is very much part of the Irish EU Presidency agenda. On that basis it will certainly form part of the discussion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>As the sitting President of the Council of Environment Ministers, the Minister must be in a position to tell us if this important issue of Kyoto will be discussed when the current President of the EU and the President of the <Col N="1500"/>United States meet in one of the Irish castles at the end of this month. If the Minister does not know, then clearly that will not happen. This meeting is one of the great billed events of the coming summer, and one would have thought that if it is to have any meaning, an issue of this importance, with the United States so much out of line with the rest of the world regarding climate change and the Kyoto commitment, should be discussed. I find it astonishing that it is not even on the agenda for the meeting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will say it is on the agenda. We will wait and see. Does the Minister realise that his utterance about economic growth being the reason we could not comply with Kyoto is itself an admission of Government failure in decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, which are generally worse in Ireland than in other European countries? Since the Minister has indicated that we need to move to a leaner economic activity base, one which is much more energy efficient, would his Department and Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, help pursue that by bringing up housing insulation standards to end-1997 standards, as advocated by Energy Action, which would result in a saving of 7% of total national energy consumption, according to Energy Action? Would the Minister agree that this should be done with existing housing stock, whatever about the new 70,000 houses being built annually, and that since the existing housing stock is in need of serious attention, he should lead on that matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party clearly does not want economic growth and creation in this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has no basis for saying that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sick and tired of listening to the Green Party constantly undermining investment in this country, which has increased the numbers in employment from almost 1.1 million people to 1.8 million. That is what has the Irish economy where it is today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Standing Order 63A,</P>
    <P LI="2">1. Noting the following information from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform:</P>
    <P LI="3">(a) that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in August 2001, on receipt of information from Interpol obtained by the United States Postal Inspection Service during a search of premises in Fort Worth, Texas, concerning details of alleged customers of a company offering access to child pornography websites, commenced an operation in relation to persons allegedly so identified from this jurisdiction,</P>
<P LI="3">(b) that these details included the names, passwords and credit card and charge card details of certain persons,</P>
<P LI="3">(c) that one of the persons from this jurisdiction so named was a Brian Curtin, 35 Ashe Street, Tralee, County Kerry, and <Col N="1502"/>that subsequent inquiries indicated that this person was Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, with a home address of 24 Ard na L&iacute;, Tralee, Co Kerry,</P>
<P LI="3">(d) that a warrant to search Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home under section 7 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 issued from the District Court on foot of an application by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 20 May 2002,</P>
<P LI="3">(e) that Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home was subsequently searched on foot of the said warrant and that garda&iacute; took possession of a personal computer and other material during the search,</P>
<P LI="3">(f) that an investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Garda authorities in October 2002 and that the Director of Public Prosecutions instructed that Judge Curtin be prosecuted for knowingly having in his possession child pornography contrary to section 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998,</P>
<P LI="3">(g) that the trial of the said charge commenced on 20 April 2004 at Tralee Circuit Court and that on 23 April 2004 Judge Curtin was found not guilty of that charge without evidence being given in relation to the subject matter of the charge, the Circuit Criminal Court having determined that the aforesaid warrant was spent when executed at the home of Judge Curtin, and:</P>
<P LI="2">2. Calls for the removal, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, of His Honour Judge Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, from office for stated misbehaviour, being his conduct in and in relation to subscribing to, accessing and use of websites containing child pornographic images and thereby rendering himself unsuitable to exercise the office of a Judge of the Circuit Court.</P>
<P FLI="0">The motion in my name is unprecedented in the history of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and this is the first time a resolution calling for the removal of a member of the Judiciary has been moved under Article 35.4 of the Constitution or pursuant to statute.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that in moving this motion, without precedent in this jurisdiction, I am deeply conscious of the underlying obligation which binds all of the organs of State established by the people under the Constitution to act fairly and in accordance with the terms of that Constitution. For this reason, I am heavily constrained, in the interests of fairness, as to what factual material I can appropriately lay before the House today.</P>
    <P>The House has adopted a Standing Order (SO 63A) this day to provide for a framework in <Col N="1503"/>which resolutions under Article 35.4 can be dealt with. That Standing Order envisages that a motion under Article 35.4 and pursuant to section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 or section 20 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946 can be moved and can be either rejected or that the debate on it can be adjourned in order to enable a select committee to be established to examine the matter further. It is my present intention accordingly, having proposed the motion, to move the adjournment of further discussion on that motion so that the procedures envisaged by Standing Order 63A can be followed.</P>
    <P>I should say at the outset that the Constitution vests in both Houses of the Oireachtas a power to entertain and pass resolutions calling for the removal of a judge for stated misbehaviour or for stated incapacity. That power does not amount to the administration of criminal or civil justice and it is also to be distinguished from the process of impeachment set out in Article 12.10 of the Constitution which relates to the President. The presidential impeachment process under Article 12.10 consists of an elaborate procedure requiring 30 Members of one House of the Oireachtas to propose impeachment and such proposal requires the support of not fewer than two thirds of the total membership of the House in which the proposal is originally made. The impeachment charge is required to be investigated by the other House of the Oireachtas and requires that the other House may remove the President from office if at least two thirds of its total membership support a resolution declaring that the charge against the President has been sustained. In Article 35.4, by contrast, the term &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; is not used and each House must come to a separate conclusion on a resolution before calling for the removal of the judge, which can be passed by a bare majority of the Members of that House who attend and vote.</P>
    <P>Each House of the Oireachtas is vested with a separate power of making its own rules and Standing Orders under Article 15 of the Constitution. The power vested in each House to consider and pass removal motions in the case of the Judiciary is, as I mentioned earlier, not an instance of the administration of civil or criminal justice but, on the contrary, a distinct constitutional function vested in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is <i>sui generis</i>. It is to the Houses of the Oireachtas that the people have entrusted the function of removing any judge who engages in stated misbehaviour or who is found to be subject to stated incapacity where, in the opinion of the Members of those Houses, such misbehaviour or incapacity warrants the removal of the judge from office.</P>
    <P>Every judge appointed under our Constitution is required to make a declaration under Article 34.5 to uphold the Constitution and the laws. Every judge is likewise required to be independent in the exercise of the judicial <Col N="1504"/>function and to be subject only to the Constitution and the law. In a constitutional democracy such as ours which is, broadly speaking, in the common law tradition, the members of the Judiciary occupy a unique central position as independent arbiters and administrators of justice and are accorded great respect and dignity by the other institutions of the State because of their unique constitutional powers and functions.</P>
    <P>Central to the relationship between the Judiciary and the people is a duty cast on every member of the Judiciary not to bring his or her status as a member of the Judiciary into disrepute or in any way to breach the constitutional expectation of the people that the judge&rsquo;s ability to uphold the law and to administer justice fairly and impartially would not be compromised. There is, accordingly, a correlative obligation on the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to be vigilant to ensure that the standard of behaviour and capacity necessary for the proper discharge of the judicial function is maintained and is not compromised or damaged, and, where it appears to the Members of either House of the Oireachtas that there are serious grounds to believe that there has been a departure from those standards, to inquire into the matter in the context of exercising the Houses&rsquo; powers under Article 35.4 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it is not merely the entitlement of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to fairly and dispassionately discharge their functions under Article 35.4 in appropriate cases, it is their manifest constitutional duty to do so. Failure to do so in certain circumstances could be deeply damaging to the whole constitutional order.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is part of the mutual respect owed between the three arms of Government &mdash; legislative, executive and judicial &mdash; that the constitutional power and function of the Members of the Oireachtas under Article 35.4 should only be considered for exercise in cases where the facts appear to exceed a threshold of gravity which makes removal an appropriate option. There is no halfway house between a judge holding office and a judge ceasing to hold office under our law. It is not possible for the Houses of the Oireachtas, Government or the president of any court to permanently &ldquo;retire&rdquo; a judge while in office. As long as a person holds judicial office in accordance with the law, that person may not be side-lined or suspended from his or her judicial functions with indefinite effect.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were informed by Interpol that information had been obtained by the United States postal inspection service in the course of a search of premises in Fort Worth in Texas concerning details of alleged customers of a company which apparently offered access to websites on the Internet featuring child pornography. Since downloading and possession of child pornography is an offence under section 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act <Col N="1505"/>1998, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an operation investigating whether persons from Ireland whose names appeared as having used the services of the Texas company were in knowing possession of child pornography in breach of the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>The offence in question is a serious offence carrying a maximum punishment of five years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. The information supplied to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through Interpol by the United States postal inspection service included the names, individual passwords used for accessing the pornography website and credit card and charge card details of persons appearing to have a residence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the persons so named was a Brian Curtin with an address at 35 Ashe Street, Tralee, County Kerry. Subsequent inquiries made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that the person in question appeared to be Brian Curtin, a judge of the Circuit Court, residing at 24 Ard na L&iacute;, Tralee, County Kerry. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na applied to the District Court under section 7 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 for a warrant to search Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home at 24 Ard na L&iacute;, Tralee, County Kerry. This application was made on 20 May 2002 and Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home was subsequently searched in purported reliance on the warrant. Garda&iacute; took possession of a personal computer and other written and documentary material which they found in the course of the search. An investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in October 2002 and the Director of Public Prosecutions instructed that Judge Curtin be prosecuted for knowingly having in his possession child pornography on 27 May 2002, contrary to section 6 of the Child Tracking and Pornography Act 1998.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At a sitting of the District Court on 4 April 2003, that court declined summary jurisdiction on the finding by the court that the facts alleged constituted a most serious charge. Accordingly, the matter was dealt with on indictment in the Circuit Court at Tralee, County Kerry, in a trial which commenced on 20 April 2004 and which ended on 23 April 2004 on the basis that the warrant on which the garda&iacute; searched Judge Curtin&rsquo;s house was spent on the day it was executed, namely, 27 May 2002. Due to the manner in which the trial proceeded, the decision of the Circuit Court on the validity of the warrant was dispositive of the case and the merits of the prosecution case and the defence were not entered into. Judge Curtin was acquitted of the criminal charge against him.</P>
    <P>Because of the gravity of the charge against Judge Curtin and in the context of his acquittal on a legal ruling on the validity of a warrant on foot of which his home was searched, and in view of the fundamental importance of maintaining public trust and confidence in the integrity of those exercising the judicial power of the State, the Government considered it appropriate that it <Col N="1506"/>should, through its Secretary General, request Judge Curtin to provide it with a full and complete explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the search of his home and subsequent prosecution. The Government indicated to Judge Curtin that this explanation was being sought in the context of possible action being taken under Article 35.4 of the Constitution and pursuant to section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. For the sake of completeness, arrangements have been made for all the correspondence which was transacted between the solicitors acting for Judge Curtin and the Taoiseach, the Secretary to the Government and you, a Cheann Comhairle, to be placed in the Library for the information of Members of both Houses.</P>
   
    <P>I think it appropriate that I should, however, put on the record of this House the first letter in that exchange of correspondence which reads as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">27 April 2004.</P>
    <P LI="1">His Honour Judge Brian Curtin</P>
    <P LI="1">Tralee</P>
    <P LI="1">Co. Kerry.</P>
    <P LI="1">Dear Judge Curtin,</P>
    <P LI="1">I have been directed by the Government to write to you in the following terms.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">As you are aware, on the afternoon of 20th May 2002, His Honour Judge Peter Smithwick, President of the District Court, issued a search warrant to search your residence. A search on foot of that warrant was carried out on the afternoon of 27th May 2002. That search has given rise to a judgement of His Honour Carroll Moran in the Circuit Criminal Court last Friday in which, as you are also aware, the Court determined that the warrant was spent when executed. In consequence, it was held that material seized pursuant to that warrant was inadmissible in criminal proceedings initiated against you alleging that on May 27 2002, you had in your possession child pornography contrary to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. This resulted in your being found not guilty of that charge without evidence being given on behalf of the prosecution and, accordingly, without evidence being given by or on your behalf in relation to the matters, the subject matter of this charge.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The Government is deeply concerned by the circumstances giving rise to and surrounding these proceedings. The President of the District Court was on May 20 2002 evidently furnished by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information which enabled him to conclude that it was, in all the circumstances, appropriate that a warrant of the nature in question issue for the search of your home. The Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently initiated a prosecution against you alleging possession by you of child pornography. Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions has alleged in <Col N="1507"/>open Court that images found on your computer were those of children engaged in explicit sexual activity or depicting the genital or anal region of a child.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Apart from the position adopted by you at the trial regarding the validity of the search warrant, your detailed response to these matters and the allegations which gave rise to them, has never been recorded.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">We have been fortunate that since its foundation, the State has enjoyed the service as Judges of men and women of stature and integrity, who have generated an overwhelming public confidence in the judiciary. That public confidence is critical to the effective operation of our Courts and thus of our constitutional system. Clearly, any circumstances which threaten to undermine that public confidence are of the greatest concern to the Government, and must be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The situation which has now arisen generates, in the view of the Government, circumstances and concerns of a highly unusual and exceptional nature. You, as a sitting Judge, have been charged with a criminal offence. The most Senior Judge of the District Court determined that there was sufficient evidence tendered to him on May 20 2002, to justify granting a warrant to members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to search your home. That offence as charged and allegations underlying are extremely serious. Very serious allegations have been made against you in a Court of law by counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions. You have been acquitted of that charge, but that acquittal occurred in a context where your defence to the underlying factual allegations has been neither recorded by you, nor tested or adjudicated upon.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The Government, I should observe, is acutely conscious of the importance of the principle of the independence of the Judiciary in the exercise of their judicial functions. Necessary corollaries of that principle are the importance, indeed necessity, of maintaining public confidence in the judiciary and, therefore, having an effective system for the removal of judges when necessitated. Because of the exceptional circumstances to which I have referred (which I should observe, do not relate in any way to the discharge by you of your Judicial Office), having regard to the critical importance of public confidence in the Judiciary and in the light of the legitimate concerns generated by the facts as I have outlined them above, the Government, having considered this matter this morning, has directed me to write to you seeking factual information and comments from you and thus your co-operation in furnishing such information and comments to the Government.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Specifically, I have been instructed to request that you record, in the first instance in writing, your precise response to the allegations <Col N="1508"/>made against you in and surrounding the criminal proceedings to which I have referred. You should feel free in that response to address any matters which you feel to be relevant to your position in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Given the importance of the mutual respect due between the institutions of the State, and having regard to the critical importance of public confidence in the judiciary, the Government believes that it is entitled to expect a full and frank disclosure from you of the information and comments which are sought from you and to be apprised of the full circumstances surrounding the matters referred to.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Accordingly, it is expected that full and detailed factual responses will be given by you to this letter bearing in mind the considerations I have outlined above.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">In respect of this request I would be grateful if you could respond, in writing, furnishing the explanations sought in this letter not later than 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 4th May 2004. These can be faxed to my office at fax number (01) 6766830 or forwarded by e-mail to me at <i>dermot.mccarthy@taoiseach.gov.ie.</i></P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">For the avoidance of any doubt, I should make clear the precise context in which this information is sought. The Courts of Justice Act 1924 and the provisions of Article 35(4) of the Constitution, enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass a resolution removing a Circuit Judge from Office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity. In the light of the matters referred to above, the members of the Government &mdash; who can propose a resolution to this effect &mdash; require to be apprised by you of the information and comments referred to here so that they can fairly consider a decision to initiate such a resolution on grounds of misbehaviour. I should also observe the belief of the Government that subscription to websites containing explicit sexual images of children, possession of images of the nature alleged here, and/or a failure to co-operate with the Government in its efforts to ascertain all circumstances relevant to these charges would furnish grounds for the proposal of such a resolution. The importance of a prompt and comprehensive response is, I hope, apparent.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Given the urgency of this matter I am arranging for this letter to be sent to you, by hand, and in addition a copy of it is being sent to the solicitor who acted for you in the course of the recent criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">I await your response to this request from the Government and I look forward to your co-operation with the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P LI="1">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P LI="1">Dermot McCarthy, Secretary General to the Government.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Members of the House will also note that among the correspondence in the Oireachtas Library is a letter from the legal advisers to Judge Curtin to <Col N="1509"/>the Ceann Comhairle, which they asked to be made available to each Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in which they contended as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">Firstly, it appears to us that there is a absolutely no constitutional basis for the committee structure proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Having considered this matter and taken advice in respect thereof, we submit that the proper constitutionally mandated process for the impeachment of our client must consist of full hearings before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">Further in our opinion Judge Curtin is entitled to a trial before both Houses of the Oireachtas as this constitutional function of both Houses of the Oireachtas cannot be delegated to any committee or any other body.</P>
    <P FLI="0">While I am reluctant at this point to appear to become involved in legal debate by proxy on the floor of this House, I believe that two points ought to be made about those contentions.</P>
    <P>First, I believe and I am advised that the proposed process under the Standing Order is constitutional and does not amount, in any sense, to a &ldquo;trial&rdquo; by a committee or to a delegation of such a process to a committee. I would emphasise that the process envisaged by the Standing Order adopted today enables the joint committee to avail of the compellability powers regarding production of documents, records and evidence and will, accordingly, create a separate legitimate basis for the consideration of such material in no way circumscribed by the decision and outcome of the criminal proceedings against Judge Curtin. The decision on the exercise of compellability powers is one, of course, for the committee. Second, admissibility or relevance issues will be dealt with fairly and properly in due course.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware that it was out of respect for the judicial arm of the State that the Government sought an explanation and afforded an opportunity to Judge Curtin and his legal advisers to furnish such an explanation in advance of the tabling of any resolution under Article 35.4 related to Judge Curtin. The House should also be aware from the correspondence that no such substantive explanation was given and that the legal advisers to Judge Curtin take and took the view that the only bodies to which such an explanation might appropriate be tendered was the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves. I wish the House to know, accordingly, that the Government took every step to avoid a resolution under Article 35.4 being tabled without affording as a matter of basic fairness an opportunity to Judge Curtin to give reasons such a step would be inappropriate or unwarranted.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on the basis of material and information furnished to me, and in the absence of any substantive explanation indicating a basis for concluding at this stage at any rate that there was <Col N="1510"/>no stated misbehaviour, I regard it as my duty to place this matter before the Houses for the ultimate judgment of their Members.</P>
    <P>In so doing, I am, as I mentioned earlier, conscious of the overriding need that the manner in which the matter should now be considered by each House of the Oireachtas should demonstrably conform with ordinary fairness and constitutional norms.</P>
    <P>I stress that in moving this resolution I, like every other Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, am obliged to keep an open mind as to whether the facts and information as known to me, and as will become known to the Members of the Houses by means of the processes for which provision has been made in Standing Orders, are established to our satisfaction, or are capable of explanation consistent with the absence of stated misbehaviour or are of such gravity as to justify in the last analysis the passing of this resolution by this House.</P>
    <P>We should all be careful in what we say and do and, while not flinching from our constitutional function and duty in this matter, to say or do nothing which might be seen to incapacitate or compromise ourselves in any way in the discharge of that duty.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the tabling and proposing of this resolution is something which no holder of my office could ever have envisaged as a likely or probable part of the discharge of that office. If there were some approach open to me or to the Government other than the invocation of Article 35.4 of the Constitution which could reserve public confidence in the integrity of the judicial function, the House may rest assured that I and the Government would have given it every consideration. However, the House will see on careful examination of the correspondence furnished to it that no other course is reasonably open in the particular circumstances of this case and in the light of what has transpired.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Members of this House to approach this matter in a fair-minded, open-minded and non-partisan way. This issue is one without party-political or governmental-Opposition implication. The seriousness of the issue and the gravity of approach which it deserves should exclude from our proceedings on this motion any temptation to score points at each other&rsquo;s expense to the detriment of the objectivity of any ultimate decision we make on the motion.</P>
    <P>The eyes of the people whom the Constitution serves are rightly focused on these Houses, and their expectation will be that we will deal with these issues in a manner which is effective, fair, devoid of self interest &mdash; political or personal &mdash; and which demonstrates that the Members of these Houses stand capable and willing to discharge the functions imposed on them by that Constitution.</P>
    <P>In light of what I have said earlier and the procedure laid down by the House, I intend, <Col N="1511"/>unless Members offer, to propose that the debate be adjourned.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister&rsquo;s proposal that the debate be adjourned agreed? Agreed.</P>

   <Title>Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 58:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 51, line 27, to delete &ldquo;High&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;District&rdquo;.</P>
    <P el="0" Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in).<?oasys _is0p10-?></P>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already responded to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on the reasons the right of appeal from a decision of the ombudsman should lie to the High rather than the District Court as his amendment proposed. He questioned how this would relate to the existing rights of recourse to the District Court which are contained in Part 8 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended by the 2003 legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 125(2) of the Credit Union Act provides that a dispute between a credit union and one of its members is to be dealt with in accordance with the credit union rules. Subsection (3) provides for referral of the dispute, with the consent of the parties to the financial regulator, unless this is expressly forbidden by the credit union rules. In either case subsection (4) provides that the decision is not subject to review by a court but that application for enforcement of a decision may be made to the District Court. Subsection (5) provides that where the rules of a credit union do not deal with the resolution of disputes or where a dispute has not been determined under a credit union&rsquo;s rules within 50 days, the dispute may be referred to the District Court. Section 126 of the Act makes provision for the resolution of disputes by arbitration where this is provided for in the credit union rules.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Credit Union Act contained in page 191 of the Bill provide that, notwithstanding the provisions of the legislation I have outlined, the ombudsman can deal with a complaint against a credit union provided it is within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. The amendments also delete section 127 of the Act which gave the Minister the power to require a credit union to join a scheme for the investigation of complaints against the credit union. This power has never been used and the new ombudsman scheme provided for in the Bill is the type of scheme envisaged by section 121. What this will mean in practice is that a member of a credit union who has a dispute with the credit <Col N="1512"/>union about the provision of a financial service can either use the mechanism set out in the Credit Union Act which may involve referral to the District Court or can use the alternative mechanism of referring the case to the ombudsman, having given the credit union a reasonable opportunity to deal with the complaint. I hope that with this explanation Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will reconsider his amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 59 to 65, inclusive, not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 53, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(1A) The Financial Services Ombudsman shall, whenever asked to do so by the Regulatory Authority, provide that Authority with records or copies of records, or information, dealing with specified matters, or matters of a specified kind, relevant to the performance of that Authority&rsquo;s functions.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We now come to amendment No. 66<i>a</i>.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle stating that amendment No. 66<i>a</i> is being ruled out of order because it is relevant to a part of the Bill already disposed of. That is accurate. I suggest, however, that we could consider this issue by recommitting the Bill to Committee Stage in respect of this amendment on the grounds that events have unfolded since which have brought the issue into sharper relief. For example, where the regulatory authority decides that an investigation will not occur in respect of wrongdoing, should that decision be qualified in some way? My proposal is that it should be qualified. If the regulatory authority decides there will be no investigation it should be obliged to certify why it is making that decision and publish its reasons for taking the view that an investigation should not take<?oasys _jy?>place.</P>
    <P>The background to this is that the Minister argued persuasively that it was not necessarily required to send in the tanks for every misdemeanour. There could be circumstances where through an oversight or whatever, a regulation has been breached, the breach is admitted and the regulator decides not to have an investigation and instead simply acknowledges that it took place and decides what penalty to impose, if any. There are cases for that approach. The objective of IFSRA is to rule on the basis of <Col N="1513"/>principle, in other words, to try to instil an ethical culture in organisations.</P>
    <P>However, the public could be forgiven for thinking there is a danger that a provision such as this might result in issues that should be investigated being swept under the carpet. The Minister needs to assure the public that where the regulator has this discretion, and I believe it should have that discretion, it will only use it where there are clear reasons that stand up to public scrutiny for doing so. I sought in the amendment which you ruled out of order, a Cheann Comhairle, to have that requirement placed on the authority.</P>
    <P>The events of the last week have shown how important it is that justice is not only done but seen to be done. Where a regulator should decide that an offence need not be investigated any further, it has a duty to explain to the public why it takes that view and the decision must stand up to scrutiny. There has been public disquiet about this provision since the Report Stage amendment was made. People express concern about what economists describe as &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo;, that is, where the regulator and the regulated become unhealthily close. The regulator might decide to sweep an issue under the carpet because the appalling vista of having it examined in public would not be in the interests of the banking sector.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we cannot have that approach to regulation and I do not believe it will happen. However, that is the reason I hope the Government will agree to allow the Bill to be recommitted to Committee Stage so there can be a short discussion and decision on it.</P>

	<P>The reason the amendment was ruled out of order was that it refers to section 33AR, which was inserted into the principal Act by the Minister&rsquo;s Report Stage amendment No. 11. It would not be possible at this stage to return to that section. We must keep moving forward on the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

	<P>That was all sections. I am only seeking its recommittal in respect of this issue. The Minister proposes to recommit the Bill in respect of some later issues he has identified.

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommittal would have had to take place before we dealt with section 33AR, as this amendment is directly related to it. A decision by the House has already been taken in regard to that. It would not be appropriate to recommit on this section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The House took that decision on the basis of incomplete knowledge of the situation. There was short introduction by the Minister, following which questions were left unanswered. The Minister was unable to address them in the two minutes available to him, as he admitted at the time, and the House proceeded to take a decision without having had a chance to tease out these issues.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Chair is trapped by the approach the Government has taken. You have been dealt a hand of cards that should not have been dealt to you by the Government. In accepting your ruling, it must be said that the Government has abused and cleverly used the procedures to bypass a fair assessment of the issues before us.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 71:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 56, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) In appointing persons as members of the Consultative Consumer Panel, the Minister shall ensure that at least 50 per cent of the members of the panel have experience in the provision of advice and information to consumers in relation to the core financial services areas under the Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s remit.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1516"/>
    <P FLI="0">This addresses the membership of the consultative consumer panel. It is to consist of not fewer than five and not more than 20 members. We have already failed in our attempt to ensure gender equality or assured representation for women on the panel.</P>
    <P>This amendments seeks to replace lines 1 to 5 of section 57(<i>c</i>)(x)(iii) and to provide that the Minister will allow for 50% of the members of the consultative consumer panel to be people with &ldquo;experience in the provision of advice and information to consumers in relation to the core financial services areas under the Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s remit&rdquo;. That is most important. The provision in the Bill as presented to us, states: &ldquo;as far as possible ... those persons have knowledge or experience of, or as consumers of financial services&rdquo;. I presume everyone is a consumer of financial services in some shape or form. The majority of people also have experience of financial services. However, to say that a person should have knowledge of financial services is not sufficient. The provision is imprecise and its application is too wide. Under this provision almost anyone could be appointed to the panel without consideration of his or her suitability, level of information or expertise.</P>
    <P>I seek to ensure that the criteria laid down for appointment to the consumer panel are specific and remove the vagueness in the Minister&rsquo;s wording. The wording presented could allow almost any person to qualify for inclusion on the panel. While everybody should qualify, there is a need to ensure that the necessary expertise is represented. My amendment seeks to improve the wording presented. People with experience and expertise in advocacy should make up at least half the panel. That knowledge is critical to the success of the consultative panel. We need people who are familiar with dealing with financial institutions on behalf of consumers and will bring a vital expertise to the panel&rsquo;s deliberations. That is essential.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the proposition favourably. The amendment strengthens the consultative consumer panel and this is in the interest of all consumers. I do not intend to create an exclusiveness to a particular area of expertise but to guarantee that at least 50% of the panel will have that expertise and knowledge. I commend the amendment to the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment, No. 72, is similar to others that are being discussed. The central point is that consumer interests are not adequately represented under the current wording of the Bill. If the recent scandals in the financial services sector have taught us anything, it is that those who are obliged to regulate and those who are ultimately given sanctioning authority over misdemeanours are often from the same group of people. People who work in the banking and financial services industry make judgments about others in the same sector.</P><Col N="1517"/>
    <P>In all this we see little or no representation of consumer interest. How that consumer interest is defined and represented is open to question. The suggested membership of the panel in the Bill does not dictate whether consumer interests are represented or by whom they are represented. Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s amendment, my amendment seeks to ensure that at least 50% of those on the panel have experience of the issues surrounding consumer protection. This does not exclude people who operate in the area of advocacy, whether voluntary or otherwise. MABS, for example, works on behalf of the State and includes many people who have experience of dealing with those whose rights as consumers and citizens are not respected by the financial institutions. We may find many people with the experience we require in this area.</P>
    <P>There are also consumer rights and advocacy groups. I fully understand the need for the Minister to define them according to how representative they are. I do not think that will be a difficulty in this section of the Bill. However, the legislation lacks an opportunity to identify how consumers&rsquo; interests are being represented and by whom. Consumer protection is mentioned but the Bill does not spell out specifically how it is to be achieved. Any one of this group of amendments, if accepted, would improve the Bill by bridging this gap. I hope the Minister is amenable to accepting such amendments, even if they include the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;, which seems to be tantamount to a swear word since no other Opposition amendment containing this word has been accepted.</P>

	<P>The Labour Party has put much work into this amendment. It is unfortunate that Report Stage is being taken by the Government when the Minister for Finance is not available to <Col N="1518"/>engage in a serious discussion on the amendments. We are witnessing the creation by the Government of a regulatory structure which is essentially a creature of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. IFSRA was born tied to the apron strings of the Central Bank. It was supposed to act independently and operate under a specific brief on behalf of consumers. Instead we find that as usual, Fianna F&aacute;il has left some leeway for the 20 public appointments to be stuffed with the usual party hacks, cronies and yes-men of the financial services industry. These people are responsible for past tax scandals as well as the currently unfolding scandals in the largest commercial bank in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State can listen to this and not even blush because as far as Fianna F&aacute;il is concerned, it does not matter that 40,000 Irish people work in this area and the pension funds of Irish workers are tied up under the tender loving care of the kind of people who gave us Faldor.</P>

	<P>When the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in government it made a sweetheart deal with AIB. She should not give me any lectures.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is supposed to be a regulatory model which will offer genuine independent oversight and scrutiny of the activities of banks. The Minister of State is refusing the Sinn F&eacute;in, Green Party and Labour Party&rsquo;s reasoned amendments and stuffing it with the usual suspects of his party hacks, party cronies and the usual suspects from the financial services industry. The Labour Party amendment specifically proposes that those lucky enough to be appointed to the panel by Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs &mdash; I almost forgot the PDs; it is difficult to remember them these days because it does not appear as if they exist anymore &mdash; should be people involved in consumer protection. I will reiterate for the Minister of State why this is important.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, there have been reports by very fine financial journalists of mis-selling of products. Thank God we have such journalists here, because if we did not have them, I do not know to what level of financial and tax scandal we would have sunk. There have been reports of people in their nineties being sold ten-year investment products. This has not been denied by our august financial institutions. People have been switched and switched again from one product to a fresh product for which further services apply. A number of building societies charge such extreme penalties if one falls behind on one&rsquo;s mortgage repayments that the costs incurred as a consequence of not meeting the building society&rsquo;s penalty clauses are such that ordinary families are driven into debt and, in some instances, lose ownership and possession of the family home. These are some of the scandals over and beyond what has been disclosed in the past two weeks to which the financial services industry is an active party. While everyone in the <Col N="1519"/>financial services industry is not involved in such activities, a significant number of people are involved. The purpose of this amendment is to give the financial services ombudsman a panel which will include people of power, advocacy and with independence of mind and action who will be in a position to right some of the wrongs regularly done to people who buy and use financial services. The Minister, Deputy Harney, and the PDs lost the battle to control this regulatory framework. Instead the Minister for Finance won the battle. The determination of the Department of Finance appears to be to protect the financial institutions at all costs. It does not matter what sharp practices some people engage in. It does not matter what happens to some elderly people who are mis-sold policies. It does not matter that some families are made to utilise credit way beyond their capacity to pay and are thereafter plunged into years of horrendous debt because of mis-selling of financial products by the financial services industry. The proposals put forward in the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment, and the similar proposals of the other two parties, are reasonable and reasoned. In the context of the scandals that have unfolded over the past three weeks, they vindicate our assertion that the approach in the Bill is wrong and the comments being put forward by the Opposition in the form of Report Stage amendments are correct.</P>
    <P>I say this with no animus towards the Minister of State who is just doing a job dumped on him by the Government after everyone else has left to go out canvassing or wherever. It is a pity, in attempting to clean up the financial services industry that, when it comes to the important part of the discussion, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, the two Ministers with governmental responsibility in these areas, are not here. I accept the junior Minister and the officials will pass on our comments to the Minister for Finance. However, we are involved in a completely useless exercise, except to enter caveats so that later on, when more scandals occur, we will probably be in the rather unfortunate position of saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendments are in a similar vein, even though it does not appear others see them in that light.</P>
    <P>This is one of the important dimensions of the new Bill. There are significant changes in the Bill which must be welcomed. One relates to what we agreed previously, that is, communication between Revenue, the corporate enforcement body and the regulatory authority. We are seeing some of the merits of this in that these agencies are becoming involved. I hope they will attempt to get to grips with the malpractice which has been rampant in the financial services industry. Members of the public are dismayed at what has been happening.</P>
    <P>The other new dimension is that for the first time we will have a consumer council. It will <Col N="1520"/>represent consumer interests and comment on the performance of the regulatory authority. It will propose initiatives the regulatory authority should take. It will comment on the performance of the financial services industry and it will view the policies and codes of practice the regulatory authority introduces. This is where consumers will get the first chance to get up close and personal with the financial institutions and how they are regulated. It is absolutely essential in selecting people to be members of the authority to look for the very best people with experience in this area. We should try to get as many people as possible of high standing on to this panel.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 69 and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s amendment No. 70 propose advertising the positions. We must recognise that this is breaking new ground and bringing a coherent voice for consumers into financial regulation, something which has never existed. The Central Bank totally ignored consumer interests. It was not interested in consumer interests when the Bill was being introduced. The operation of the consumer panel will be to some extent the most significant element of the regulatory authority, which can really make a change. If a consumer panel was up and running now, it would be interesting to hear what it would say to the regulatory authority. I think it would haul in the regulatory authorities and examine what codes of practice it would enunciate for mis-selling and over-charging. How come they were caught sleeping on the job in respect of over-charging? How come no system picked up what was happening? How come they did not pick up the establishment of these offshore companies which were used for illicit activities such as tax evasion? How come when the regulatory authorities were reviewing the impact of Allfirst, Rusnak and so on the Minister did not ensure a system was in place whereby such issues were escalated to the very top of the financial institutions so that we would know senior executives and boards were receiving the reports of compliant structures that were effective and rooting out these issues? It appears these structures were not in place. If the panel consisted of the right people, it would play a significant part in the current investigation. It would represent ordinary members of the public who must carry the can.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will not accept these amendments because the Minister on Committee Stage did not. I suspect that he will not change that view no matter how persuasive we are, but hope springs eternal. We should make a genuine effort to make sure that it is not a member of the d&aacute;ilcheantar that emerges on to this. We should get the best people around, put them on to this panel and set them in a position that they can ride shotgun on the regulatory authority on behalf of consumers. After all, there is a widespread belief that consumer protection should not have been put under the remit of IFSRA. The Government has articulated an alternative view and there are many who share it <Col N="1521"/>and many who do not. The issue of whether the Government or the Opposition was right has passed, but we should make sure that the element the Government is giving to consumers, namely this consumer panel, is of the very highest calibre of people that we can find to represent those interests.</P>
    <P>That is what motivates my amendment No. 74, that at least two members of the panel would have knowledge and experience of systems for the protection of consumers. It is also behind my other amendment No. 75, that those representing consumers should not have ties with the providers of financial services. As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, the description of someone who should be deemed eligible does not seem to rule out past ties with the provision of financial services. There is no point appointing people to represent the consumer who have spent their lifetime representing the other interest. These amendments are important and I hope the Minister will accept them. If he does not, he should publish some clear protocol on how these people will be selected so that we have absolute assurance that they will not be consumers with a broad interest and with political experience, but will be people with expertise. These regulatory authorities are very complex organisations and we need people on these panels with forensic skills to carry out the task on behalf of consumers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputies, but the Minister indicated his position on Committee Stage. It is essential that members of the consumer panel have broad knowledge of consumer issues regarding financial services. That is obvious given the wide remit of the financial regulator, particularly in this important area of consumer education. The Minister tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that the key criteria for appointments are knowledge or experience as consumers of financial services. The Minister does not think it wise to narrow down the criteria further, and I agree with him.</P>
    <P>There is a very similar qualification for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, where a person has to have knowledge or practical experience of the relevant vocation on the panel to which the candidate is submitted. That is a hallowed phrase in the making of appointments. The insertion of that phrase in the Constitution on Seanad &Eacute;ireann has always resulted in a very strict application where a person has to produce qualifications. We are already inserting in the statute provision that a candidate must have knowledge or experience as consumers of financial services. That is a distinct statutory requirement. An appointment by the Government in breach of that requirement would be invalid, <i>ultra vires</i>, and unlawful.</P>
    <P>In directing his mind to who should be appointed to this body, the Minister must have regard to this prerequisite of knowledge or experience as consumers of financial services. <Col N="1522"/>That is a requirement. I know that Deputies opposite me argue that the mere holding of a bank account should not amount to knowledge or experience as consumers of financial services. There is an understandable concern that persons considered for membership of this board should have as deep a knowledge as possible of the banking sector in the interests of consumers which would make them eligible for the appointment. The Minister is required by section 57CX(2) to consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and organisations representing consumers before appointing members of the panel. An additional procedural safeguard is, therefore, inserted there.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that consumer organisations will support the appointment of persons with direct experience of consumer protection. However, to be of most use to the authority as a sounding board for consumer interests, it is important that others with a contribution to make in this area, such as persons involved in consumer education and advocacy, including those who write on the subject, must also be considered for this panel.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be helpful, as suggested in amendment No. 75 by Deputy Bruton, to exclude entirely from consideration persons with ties to providers of financial services. There is an old saying that the poacher makes a good gamekeeper. A consumer organisation might wish to propose the appointment of an independent financial adviser on the grounds that his or her knowledge of financial services might make that person a suitable member of the consumer panel. It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that the authority can benefit from a wide range of expertise among the members of the panel, including expertise in consumer protection. It would not be wise to be too prescriptive, especially given the consultative role given to consumer organisations on panel membership.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on appointments and the whole area of the political character of such appointments, as has been raised by the Deputies. The Government is accountable to this House for decisions it makes. If it appoints unsuitable persons, the Opposition is perfectly free to raise that issue. Many considerations enter the question of how Government makes appointments to particular offices. This has happened under successive Governments. As a class of elected representatives, we do no service to ourselves by constantly making these allegations because a Government is accountable to this House. If we write into legislation very narrow criteria for appointment to public offices and boards, we narrow the responsibility of the Government and we narrow the choice available to any Minister. This results in the Government being deprived of discretion in the appointment.</P>
    <P>A Government has to strive for the best. It is open to fair criticism in this House. There is a clear safeguard put into this legislation on consultation of consumer organisations. There is <Col N="1523"/>also a clear safeguard on a basic prerequisite for qualification. After that it is a matter for the Minister to make a decision. I appreciate the spirit in which these amendments have been put down. To introduce the rigid percentage requirement such as those that appeared in amendments made by Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Boyle or to define consumer protection in a very restrictive sense, for which Deputies Burton and Bruton are canvassing, does not add to the Bill. Ultimately, the Minister for Finance will be accountable to this House for appointments he makes under this measure.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister may have good intentions on this. However, the philosophy of this panel will be important. The Minister has not always inspired the confidence of consumers that his approach to consumer protection is a high priority for him. For a body such as this, it is important that the Legislature make a call on the sort of person it wants. We want people who will be vigorous and tough in their defence of consumers. We do not want people who take a soft approach and who are more interested in the prudential, profitability and risk assessment side of banking, important as those are.</P>
    <P>The Government should have more discretion if it is willing to come in before a committee and stand over its selections. It is unfair of the House to criticise people after they have been selected because we are then undermining a body which is acting in good faith. Ministers should be willing to put forward their recommendations and let the committee consider them. We would then have a more open and accountable system.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State is inexperienced in the way boards are appointed and the scope for holding people to account. I have seen some diabolical appointments made by his side of the House &mdash; I am sure he would say the same about some appointments made by my party when in Government &mdash; and the House has been powerless to hold Ministers to account without damaging the institution involved. We need a system that allows that to happen within the House, such as by a committee. If the Minister <Col N="1524"/>signed up to that I would take his view more seriously.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact. There is clearly an inequality in the approach and I protest against it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister of State&rsquo;s response <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> amendment No. 71, it is not a case, as the Minister said, of seeking to narrow the criteria any further; far from it. As the amendment clearly states, it is about ensuring that at least 50% of those appointed to the consultative consumer panel have an expertise, knowledge and experience of advocacy on the part and in the interest of consumers. That is critically important and I reject the Minister of State&rsquo;s view of what the amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <P>The reality is that what is now contained in subsection (3) amounts to a situation where anyone operating a supermarket pre-Christmas saving stamps scheme would qualify on the basis of knowledge of matters such as this. That is nonsense. The Minister of State must be more specific and he must ensure there is protection of the consumer interest. The only way that can be done is with the required expertise.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is happy to respond to Deputy Bruton on the point <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those who may have an expertise in financial and services provision but he is not as enthusiastic in the response he has given to ensure that those who have been the champions of the interest of the consumer are adequately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, what exactly is the Deputy referring to? Is he suggesting I have an amendment on financial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The Deputy has misunderstood what I said.</P>

	<P>Perhaps I have.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s contribution the Minister of State rejected a notion that there would not be participation by people who were directly involved in the financial services sector. I am saying he is keen to ensure an argument is presented that would accommodate their participation but he is not as keen to ensure there is an accommodation of those who have the expertise in advocacy in the interest of the consumer. They are the counterbalance to the very interest the Minister of State sought to protect by his response to Deputy Bruton.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly how the Minister phrased it but I assure him that a good advocate will always be a good advocate because he or she will have a proven record of performance. I have no doubt that experience and expertise will be of great value in such an engagement.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 71 does not seek to exclude people from the smallest and least experienced financial services provision, be it from a post office savings bank account or whatever. It is open to everyone but in seeking to build in a protection in terms of more than 50% having that expertise, we are ensuring that the interests of consumers are adequately protected and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>With all due respect, I thought it was a little trite of the Minister of State to say the Government will be accountable to the House in its appointments. The Government&rsquo;s record of appointing is not only not accountable to the House but it is not accountable to the electorate or the populace. That has been demonstrated not only in appointments to boards but in appointments to the Cabinet itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is blessed in his unquestioning belief in the value of the current system of appointing people to State boards, bodies and committees. Even he must realise the correlation between such people who are appointed and whatever political preferences they have expressed publicly, regardless of the Government in power at the time of their appointment. That system continues to bedevil our&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want anyone left in party politics?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Minister of State one example where that has not been the case. The <Col N="1526"/>Green Party, which has not yet been in Government, has not availed of that particular system but I was appointed by the Taoiseach to the National Economic and Social Council, not because of any party political affiliation but because I represented a body in the partnership process, the National Youth Council of Ireland, which was descriptively listed in legislation as being a direct nominating body for participation in the National Economic and Social Council. It appears that where legislation specifies directly where nominations can be made by accepted bodies with experience in the areas for which the State was establishing a grouping, the people are not chosen on the basis of party political patronage.</P>
    <P>The other system that can be adopted is a direct public appointments commission where anyone and everyone can submit nominations for whatever positions are being sought by a Government at any particular time. That, too, has merit.</P>
    <P>As for the Minister of State saying that the Government is accountable to this House in the appointments it makes, we have nothing like the system that operates in the United States Congress, the Senate or House of Representatives, whereby people who are nominated for significant bodies come before committees of that legislature to justify the reason they are being appointed, outline their experience and the commitment they can bring to the position on offer. To say that what exists here is anything like a sufficient system or a system in which we can have public confidence is laughable.</P>
    <P>All these amendments seek to put in place a degree of public confidence that does not exist in general or because of recent events surrounding confidence in financial services. If the Minister and the Government cannot see that, and if they insist on the usual practice in terms of political appointments and patronage, we are only storing the seeds for future scandals to be uncovered and improper practices to take place because we did not put in place the proper infrastructure for ensuring it did not occur in the first instance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Minister is obliged to consult consumer representatives in regard to the appointments it is likely that the panel will be broadly representative of consumers of financial services. The requirement to consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should also contribute to this outcome. I agree that persons with experience of consumer protection will definitely be on the panel but it is important that other types of experience, for example, consumer education, including journalism, and consumer advocacy should be reflected in the panel membership. Amendment No. 75, for example, tabled by Deputy Bruton, would preclude from consideration the current Consumers&rsquo; Association spokesperson on finance, who is an independent financial adviser.</P><Col N="1527"/>
    <P>Deputy Boyle drew a comparison with the constitutional system that obtains in the United States. There is no comparison with this country because, in the first instance, the United States has an elected executive Head of State and Congress operates under a completely different set of ground rules from the system that operates in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Deputy keeps repeating the word &ldquo;patronage&rdquo; but listening to his comments I have come to the view that he subscribes to the current public view, and I agree that it is a common view, that if someone is a member of a political party he or she should be disqualified from being appointed. There is a case, and I say this on a cross-party basis, for appointing people who are prepared to commit themselves to the political process and not to delegate the responsibility for making political appointments to a body which is expressly divorced from that process. That would not promote confidence among the Executive, state boards and this House. I do not propose to refer to the record of various political parties in this area but my own party has quite a good record. We have a strong record of appointing people from other political backgrounds to posts. Sometimes it is the parties which are less frequently in office and are somewhat ravenous for appointment which misbehave themselves when they are in office. However, I will not go into that issue this afternoon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I see. I welcome that clarification. It is up to others who have been in power to address that matter.</P>
    <P>This is an important series of amendments. The disposition of the Minister and the Minister of State to reject in a barefaced manner every reasonable amendment presented by Opposition Members shows a prior disposition to railroad their own text of the Bill aside from the concerns expressed. I find that objectionable. Sound arguments have been presented by Opposition Members, not least with regard to the critical focus of consumer protection. This is not in evidence in much of what the Minister and the Minister of State have argued on Committee and Report Stages. There are real deficiencies in the Bill which give rise to concern that the supposedly fundamental and underlying foundation of the Bill, with regard to consumer protection, is not being met. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the measures relating to the consultative consumer panel, which is a very important body which can only function to its real and full potential if it is made up, primarily, of people who have the expertise for which other Deputies and I have argued. They should be advocates on behalf of consumer interests.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I will be pressing this amendment. It is fundamental to the legislation before us, which is indicative of the disposition of the Minister and the Minister of State to reject the sound and reasonable arguments presented. The mask has slipped on a number of occasions and their interest in ensuring that other interests and expertise within the financial services sector are accommodated and guaranteed active participation has been revealed. I want to see a guarantee of the active participation of those who have the knowledge and experience of advocacy in the interest of consumers protected, guaranteed and insured within the make-up of the consultative consumer panel. Therefore, I will press my amendment.</P>

    <P FLI="0">The series of technical amendments tabled by the Minister to section 23 addresses concerns raised by Deputy Richard Bruton on Committee Stage. They also address concerns of accountancy bodies. The general effect of the amendments is to tighten up terminology and align it in so far as possible with the terminology in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003. As I am sure Deputies are aware, the Act implemented the main recommendations of the review group on auditing. Amendment No. 91 also provides that the authority can rely on a compliance statement provided by a financial institution under that Act if it is satisfied that it meets its requirements.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 87, in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, may be based on a misunderstanding. The regulatory authority is structured as a constituent part of the bank and the consumer director is a member of the regulatory authority. Section 33C of the Central Bank Act 1942, as inserted by last year&rsquo;s Act, makes it clear that the regulatory authority has the function of ensuring compliance by financial institutions with their obligations under financial services legislation. It would therefore be the regulatory authority, and not the Central Bank, that would exercise the powers conferred by this provision regarding compliance statements. There is nothing to prevent the authority from giving the consumer directorate the authority to act in its name under this Part.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 88, in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, section 27A already empowers the authority not only to issue guidelines on compliance statements but to issue more general guidelines on the governance of financial institutions. All such guidelines must be notified in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> and published. It is likely the authority will wish to develop and publish such guidelines to supplement the guidance on corporate governance that it has already issued using its existing powers. However, it would not be helpful to be too prescriptive about the content of such guidelines, especially because the compliance statement requirement is discretionary. It is important that any such guidelines take account of the particular features of financial institutions. The type of corporate governance and compliance regime that would be desirable for a large bank, for example, might be quite inappropriate for a small credit union or intermediary, and therefore we should not tie the hands of the authority in this area. As I believe the Minister&rsquo;s amendments address the main <Col N="1532"/>concerns raised by Deputy Richard Bruton, I hope the Deputy will agree to withdraw his amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Of all the sections that remain to be dealt with, this one gives rise to the greatest public concern, especially in the wake of the extraordinary series of events in AIB. It seems that at the time of the Rusnak debacle, the Central Bank instructed that there be an audit of the compliance procedures of all the banks in the system. We are led to believe this was in compliance with some sort of policy document or expectation that was well-known and understood by banks. We would have expected, therefore, that the compliance request from the Central Bank, which was the then regulator, would have triggered the discovery of all the instances of non-compliance that were not discovered for a very considerable period thereafter. Some instances were discovered as a result of a whistleblower and some, admittedly, were discovered internally.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is considerable unease over the extent to which we are reliant, in regulating financial institutions, on internal compliance procedures that are not up to the job. In this regard, consider serious non-compliance such as the failure to make charges in accord with what is legally permissible, which is certainly serious from the perspective of the consumer. When this form of non-compliance was discovered in the AIB, the discovery was not escalated beyond the head of the division. Apparently the head of the division did not understand that it mattered, nor did he take any steps to do anything about it. This all happened after the Central Bank had instructed that the internal compliance systems in the bank were to be audited and brought up to best practice. That is why I am reluctant to take the leap of faith the Minister of State is asking of me in this instance.</P>
    <P>We need pretty strong and clear policy statements on what compliance means. We must ask what sort of internal procedures exist to enforce compliance, what sort of work programmes are undertaken by the compliance officers, what sort of independence they have within the structure and to whom they are accountable, who has a duty of care to take action when non-compliance is discovered and who has a duty to report non-compliance to the responsible authority. I know the Minister will say the new regime is entirely different and that there is a new attitude. The evidence from recent weeks has suggested there is not really a new culture and that the same old culture exists although it may have a few new things tacked on to it. I am not an expert in this field, nor do I pretend to be. I suppose none of us is and therefore we have been seeking the recommittal to committee to allow a more free-ranging debate and to allow us take stock and hear independent expert opinion on what ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I will accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s word on amendment No. 87. It surprised me that the <Col N="1533"/>Central Bank was going to decide whether there were add-on compliance requirements over and above the compliance requirements that apply to every company. He tells me we can read the Central Bank, the regulatory authority and the consumer director interchangeably. However, the governor of the Central Bank, whom we heard yesterday, is concerned with financial meltdown. He will have a very different attitude to the sort of compliance statements that are required. He will be worried about risk management, bad debts and systems that might leave undetected huge trades that might be uncovered subsequently. They will not be the concerns of the consumer director, who will be concerned about overcharging, mis-selling, bad dealing practices and dishonest dealing practices. The Minister is asking us to believe these are all the same. In previous Stages of this Bill we stated these are not the same.</P>
    <P>The consumer director depends for her budget on the Central Bank and the regulatory authority. She has no independence from those bodies, is part of that structure and depends for her existence on that structure. I am not reassured by the Minister of State&rsquo;s sleight of hand, which suggests that for &ldquo;bank&rdquo; we should read &ldquo;anyone who has a concern&rdquo;. These are the real internal politics of the organisation as to whose view will prevail. Will it be the Governor of the Central Bank, who rightly sees his job as protecting the currency and protecting the stability of the financial system, which represent a completely different set of requirements and interests to Mary O&rsquo;Dea, the consumer director?</P>
    <P>How will those issues be resolved internally? We have no code of practice or policy statement that nails down what the Oireachtas should expect about compliance statements. We are leaving it to the internal politics of the regulatory authority to decide what will represent best practice in compliance and what we should demand in terms of compliance. While we can make that act of faith, the evidence is to the contrary. The evidence of how financial regulation has developed here and the evidence of the misdemeanours that continue to occur in the financial sector do not allow us to make those acts of faith.</P>
    <P>We need a clear code with input from the consumer panel we just mentioned, which I hope will contain strong advocates and defenders of consumer rights. They will ride shotgun on this sort of decision. As currently structured, it appears that the bank may, whenever it sees appropriate, serve on the regulatory authority a notice regarding these various matters. We need to pin down our expectation that they will consider consumer protection as one of the key compliance issues and that should be stitched in somewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State does not seem willing to accept a policy document, which was the lowest level I could propose, as it did not require a statutory provision detailing X, Y and Z, because <Col N="1534"/>inevitably things change based on the latest wheeze. It is said that regulators always arrive late and breathless. As we will always have to try to catch up with the financial wizards who move fast and ahead of the regulator, I accept it cannot be set in stone. However, we need some sort of public expression as to what sorts of compliance requirements will be expected. This is the last chance the Oireachtas will have to do this.</P>
    <P>Of course we can subsequently call in the regulators and hope we ask the right questions. However, we will depend on future members of an Oireachtas committee being able to home in on such detailed issues. I am sure the Minister will agree that these two Bills are the most tortuous to navigate. They are not even referenced or indexed for those of us who are debating them here. They are virtually impossible to handle.</P>
    <P>The experience of the past few weeks brings into very sharp relief that we ought to go down the route of principle-based regulation, as suggested by IFSRA and others, and to try to bring ethics to the boards of directors as opposed to regulating by rolling in the tanks every other day, sitting on the shoulders of bank managers and executives, and second-guessing and monitoring everything that is done. We know we do not have the resources, the regulatory regime or any of the forensic skills to do that. We will rely on a system that will be based on trying to get people thinking not only of shareholder value but understanding that good ethics form part and parcel of what they bring to the workplace. They should run their businesses according to a standard that should bear scrutiny by anyone and the regulatory authority is trying to reach that point. That represents an ideal and of course we do not live in a perfect world. However, that is the model we are trying to introduce as opposed to a model requiring daily monitoring, checking and oversight.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to carefully consider these sections on compliance as they appear to be the only vehicle to define the ethic, how it will exist in organisations and how can we verify that it rolls down to the bottom. A bank manager should not be solely driven and obsessed by how he or she can drive up the commission on his or her products, sell more products, get more front-loaded commissions so that he or she gets a good bang in the short term and how he or she can churn products so that even if it is not in the interest of the consumer, the commission increases.</P>
    <P>We must get to a point where such a person has values and understands that in addition to being profitable and getting commission, this must be done within standards which define that only products that are in people&rsquo;s interest will be sold to them, that they will only be charged according to the law for items for which they rightly paid, that they are not advised to invest in products that are not in their interests and that money will not be veered from one product line or fund to <Col N="1535"/>another because it is possible to do so without being caught.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been too quick to accept the brief handed to him stating that everything is fully thought through and everything in the garden is rosy. Contrary to what the Minister of State has said, it would be much better if the Oireachtas signed off on this legislation and made it explicit that either the bank, the regulatory authority or the consumer director could take the initiative to have compliance requirements imposed on a particular institution. I would have much greater confidence if the consumer director had the power to make these compliance requirements. While I know the Governor is an excellent person, he spends most of his hours ensuring that the system does not melt down. The Minister of State should make that explicit and not accept the brief he has been given.</P>
    <P>We need a policy document on compliance. We urgently need to have some kind of statement in the case of AIB. We need to be able to verify that no tax evasion is going on anywhere in the organisation, that no such practice would be tolerated in any case, that people would be sacked if discovered, that those in management have responsibility for ensuring it does not happen, that no mis-selling or dishonest practices take place and that no deals or reward arrangements exist for senior executives built on the sorts of foundations we have recently seen. We need a policy statement from IFSRA stating that those are the standards that must be in place. It should be in a position to ask an organisation to see the work programme to ensure the standards are being applied and to be shown what happens whenever a deviation from best practice is uncovered.</P>
    <P>My amendments go to the heart of the scandals we are trying to address. We need to ensure that the Bill is not passed just because we are at the end of a long and exhausting process and we all want to see something implemented. That is not a sufficiently good reason. We need to ensure we are doing the right thing and putting the powers in the right place. We are moving to a new ethic that has been sadly lacking in the financial sector.</P>
    <P>Given what the Government is trying to achieve, clock watching and trying to pass the legislation before the summer recess whether or not the Minister is in the House is not the right approach. I hope the Minister of State will reconsider and accept my amendments. If they do not quite meet the case, I hope the Minister will produce his own amendments in the Seanad to give the public confidence that everything has changed in terms of the standards we expect financial institutions to observe.</P>
    <P>The public must be assured that we are determined to drive consistently for this sort of ethic to apply and will do whatever it takes to get it done. We are not overburdening financial institutions with regulations, we are asking them <Col N="1536"/>to internalise proper ethics within their organisational structures. That must be our objective and it behoves us to take the time to see that we achieve it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Deputy makes a very fair case, there is an answer to it. There are a number of reasons compliance statements and their content are being left to the discretion of the regulator. While compliance statements as a matter of practice will be an integral part of the scheme envisaged by the legislation, there are reasons the requirement to provide such statements is being left to the discretion of the regulator. Deputy Richard Bruton is trying to move a step further by making the preparation of a compliance statement mandatory in all cases but we must recognise that most of the larger financial institutions are obliged to provide a compliance statement under the terms of companies legislation enacted last year. This compliance statement covers compliance with company law, revenue law and any other enactments which provide a legal framework within which the company operates and which may materially affect its financial statements. For financial services companies, financial services legislation overseen by IFSRA is an important part of the legal framework within which they operate. In general, it is material to their financial positions. It is therefore possible for IFSRA to rely on compliance statements of this sort in many cases. As a matter of good regulatory practice, the financial regulator should not unnecessarily burden such institutions with the obligation to produce a compliance statement covering substantially the same ground.</P>
    <P>As was recognised by the review group on auditing, many of the institutions regulated by IFSRA fall into the small business category. To quote from the report, there are a number of small financial entities including retail investment intermediaries, insurance intermediaries and small credit unions which fall into the small business category. The report recommended that the degree to which the recommendations should apply to smaller financial entities should be examined further. For small businesses it is especially important that the existing regulatory burden should not be worsened by the unnecessary imposition of an additional regulatory burden. Instead, we have provided a power for the regulator to require a compliance statement where it considers the circumstances to merit it.</P>
    <P>The regulator could, for example, require a particular institution or category of institution to provide such a statement on particular legislation such as the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This would have the effect of focusing the attention of directors and senior managers on the adequacy or otherwise of controls and procedures in place to ensure such compliance. The regulator will use his discretionary power in this area wisely and in accordance with the principles of better <Col N="1537"/>regulation. For those reasons, the Government provision represents a better approach than the more prescriptive one advocated by Deputy Richard Bruton. It is fully in line with the recommendations of the review group on auditing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not addressed my points at all. I acknowledge that he has read from a prepared script. I am asking why we are not being allowed to provide the Director of Consumer Affairs who represents an entity in herself and is a member of the board with the discretion to require compliance statements. She should not have to mediate the demand through the entire structure. This is the net point of the change I seek and it was not addressed in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply. I am aware that the Companies Act requires a compliance statement, a provision which quite manifestly failed in the case of AIB which did not demonstrate compliance in respect of consumer law.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be prescriptive, I am saying that we need a policy document from IFSRA. The authority should set out the policy it expects to be followed within compliance which does not imply requiring every credit union to sign off on 120 different actions requiring hours upon hours of box ticking for six months. I am saying there has to be a policy. It can include proportionality whereby certain compliance requirements are made of institutions of varying sizes and different compliance expectations are made of institutions trading in certain types of derivative products or products the complexity of which consumers might not immediately understand.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A policy is required whereby it is clear to everyone what IFSRA expects. We must ask IFSRA to articulate such a policy to ensure that where something happens in AIB, for example, we have a document which proves its chairman knew what it was. We can ask why certain actions were not taken and why any incidents were not reported to senior management. If it says on page 6 that an issue of a certain nature should be escalated to the board of directors to allow it to make appropriate decisions, we should be in a position to ask what happened. We need a document to be able to hold people to account. I hope we will see boards of directors and executives saying we have got it right and agreeing that the most successful businesses are the ones which are ethical as well as profitable. The Minister of State did not address any of those issues. Sadly, as it is Report Stage I will be told that I am out of time and this is the last word I can have on the subject.</P>

    <P LI="3">&ldquo;1 month after the date of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the financial service provider&rsquo;s accounts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment and amendments Nos. 96 and 97 are largely technical in character. Amendment No. 93 recognises that not all financial service providers have their accounts ready for audit within three months of the end of the financial year. It therefore changes the obligation on the auditor to provide the required statement to the regulator within one month of completing the audit of the accounts. Amendments Nos. 94 and 95 tighten up terminology. This series of amendments to section 23 addresses the main concerns expressed by accounting bodies about the section. I hope Deputy Richard Bruton accepts that it meets the case he has made in amendments Nos. 96 to 98, inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do know what the Minister of State has done to build that hope. My understanding was that there was a compliance requirement on auditors requiring them to state whether circumstances had arisen that require a report of the matter to the bank. They felt it was too onerous for them to have to issue a report on every occasion and that they should do so only in the case of non-compliance. They agreed that non-compliance should be reported but not that they should be obliged to create a report if there was not non-compliance. This was the essence of the point made in amendment No. 94. Has the Minister taken this on board in respect of this amendment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to amendment No. 93, the Minister seeks to delete the words &ldquo;3 months after the end of each financial year of a regulated financial service provider,&rdquo;. This is understandable and quite straightforward as the three-month period is the issue. However, the Minister&rsquo;s substitution is more convoluted. While it suggests a period of one month, this is not one month after the end of each financial year but one month after the date of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the financial service <Col N="1543"/>providers&rsquo; accounts. Is it specified when the auditor&rsquo;s report and the financial service provider&rsquo;s account should be presented? I am concerned and would like the Minister of State to elaborate because while the first reading might suggest there is a best performance in terms of time diligence, I wonder if that is really the case given the convoluted presentation the Minister of State now offers in substitution. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this because I am concerned about the effect of amendment No. 93 compared with the wording in the text of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The text of the Bill being amended reads, &ldquo;Within 3 months after the end of each financial year of a regulated financial service provider, or within such extended period as the Bank allows, the auditor of the service provider shall deliver a written report&rdquo;. As I have outlined already, this amendment is intended to take account of the fact that not all financial service providers must submit their accounts within three months of the end of the financial year. Limits are set out in legislation but they are not always within three months and the effect of this section will be that the issuance of a set of audited accounts by the auditor will trigger a one-month deadline for meeting obligations under this section. This amendment arises in Part 4 of the Bill which implements the recommendations of the review group on auditing for financial service providers. I hope that clarifies matters.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for trying to throw light on the matter but I understood that they do not all present reports within a specified period of three months, as indicated in section 27B(2) of Chapter 3. What mechanism is being employed for the alternative presented here to ensure that we receive the annual report of the auditor on the annual report of the specified institution? What will ensure that we have it within a specified, or even a reasonable, time following the conclusion of the financial year, given that the calendar year and the financial year are now contemporaneous?</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister of State has said, I am still concerned about the timeframe being one month after the date of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the financial service provider&rsquo;s account because there is no specification of when the auditor must report. The situation appears even worse to me after the amendment so I would like the Minister of State, who moved it, to help me through this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The time limits are set out in the different legislation that covers companies and financial services. There are different time limits prescribed in different Acts and this section is drafted to accommodate the differing legislation. It is expressed as within three months after the end of each financial year or within such extended period as the bank allows, but there is <Col N="1544"/>always a time limit and that is clear in the legislation.</P>

	<P>The amendment creates a strict deadline of one month after the date of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the financial service provider&rsquo;s account. It introduces an absolute deadline into the legislation. It is a double lock that provides a further, absolute guarantee of a one-month limit. The effect of the amendment will be that when a set of audited accounts are issued, a one-month deadline will be triggered to meet the obligations under this section. I accept that it is very technical.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Richard Bruton raised issues concerning the relationship between his amendments and those tabled by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 96, section 27B implements a recommendation of the review group on auditing that the external auditors of financial institutions should provide an annual positive statement to the Central Bank on whether anything has come to their attention that gives rise to a legislative duty to report to the Central Bank. Subsection 2(<i>a</i>), as amended by amendment No. 93, provides that within one month of the auditor&rsquo;s report on a financial service provider&rsquo;s account, the auditor must provide a written report to the bank stating if circumstances have arisen that required him or her to report a matter to the bank under prescribed enactments and what those circumstances are. Deputy Richard Bruton&rsquo;s amendment would not implement the recommendation of the review group that requires a positive statement from the auditor that no statutory duty to report to the regulator arose during the financial year. The amendment would weaken the legislation.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 95, section 27B implements the recommendation of the review group on auditing on the external auditing of a financial institution that there must be this annual positive statement to the Central Bank on whether anything has come to the attention of the auditor. Subsection (4) lists the financial services legislation under which an auditor has a duty to report to the bank in circumstances specified in the legislation. The Bill lists section 33 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, which deals with auditors and their duties related to investment business firms which are not incorporated bodies, such as brokers. The Deputy wants to limit the application of this provision to subsection (3) only, which deals with the duty of an auditor to report to the regulator in certain <Col N="1545"/>circumstances. However, it is suggested that the duty to report should extend to the entire section, for example, subsection (7) which imposes a duty on the auditor to report to the supervisory authority, and not just to the subsection sought by the Deputy. Again, a wider obligation is imposed in the Government proposal.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>On amendment No. 98, Deputy Richard Bruton wanted to include &ldquo;and that is reasonably required by the Bank for a specific purpose&rdquo;. Again, section 27F implements a recommendation of the review group on auditing that audit paper should be available on request to the Central Bank and, under the provisions of section 27F, the bank may require an auditor or affiliate of the auditor to provide it with a copy of any record relating to work carried out for the service provider that is in the possession of the auditor or affiliate. The Minister is satisfied that the thrust of this part and the provisions of it make clear that the regulator will only use the powers being provided when there is an express need to do so. Adding the qualifier &ldquo;and that is reasonably required by the Bank for a specific purpose&rdquo; unnecessarily provides the potential for obstructive behaviour by auditors.</P><?oasys _xh?>

	<P>I move amendment No. 98<i>a</i>:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 85, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">Notwithstanding any other penalty provisions in the foregoing, if the financial service provider is a body corporate or an <Col N="1546"/>unincorporated body, the maximum penalty shall be either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) &euro;5,000,000, or</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) a sum equal to the amount involved in the financial impropriety,</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p2-?>whichever is the greater.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">We were dealing with penalties and whether they are commensurate with the size of the financial institution&rsquo;s operation. I suggested that we consider having not only a maximum penalty of &euro;5 million but a penalty which would equal the amount involved in the financial impropriety. Very substantial sums were involved in the recent case of overcharging and in that case there are no penalties. Penalties should be commensurate with the size of the organisation involved and with the scale of the impropriety. For some very large institutions penalties of this nature might not be particularly relevant, but for other small institutions a maximum penalty of &euro;5 million would be a major penalty. In competition law the maximum penalty is related to the turnover of the company and the penalty can be up to 10% of the company&rsquo;s turnover. I seek a reconsideration of the issue of maximum penalties and of the possibility of introducing a structure of penalties that is more proportionate to the offence or to the size of the organisation. It would be a more effective deterrent if the penalty were more directly related to the offence committed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Deputy Bruton raising this matter again. I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply with interest. However, I take a slightly different view to Deputy Bruton on the amendment. I wonder whether we should prescribe the maximum penalty when our recent experience indicates that a minimum penalty might be more applicable. As for a sum equal to the amount involved in the impropriety, that is hardly a disincentive when the institution has had the use of moneys from which it has benefited over a period of time. Is there any allowance, for example, regarding AIB&rsquo;s overcharging from 1994 for the interest that accrued to the bank from the use of money belonging to its customers?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw it as a 100% penalty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a penalty of 100% on top of the reimbursement. I accept Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s point on that.</P>
    <P>While it will not be accommodated in this exchange, I want to highlight again, as I did yesterday, that I strongly believe that if penalties are applied only to the institution the culture that is more and more being exposed will be perpetuated &mdash; and I speak as somebody who worked in a financial institution for many years &mdash; not at the counter in terms of provincial banking, which was the extent of my experience, but at the level of those who devise and order and <Col N="1547"/>oversee the implementation of policy. We saw in today&rsquo;s national newspapers the exposure by a former member of the bank who retained the missive that had been sent to staff in which additional decimal points were added to the publicised rate that was to apply. That would have led to a significantly greater charge, particularly in regard to major transactions. Over a period of time significant additional profit would have accrued to the bank over and above what should have accrued on the basis of the publicised rate.</P>
    <P>That example underlines where we need to focus penalties. The financial institutions will ultimately pass penalties on to the customer base by one means or another. The only people who will bear the brunt of penalising the institutions will be ordinary members of society who constitute the customer base of the financial institutions. The only way we can stamp out such practice is to make it absolutely unattractive and unacceptable within the institutions. That means ultimately that the penalties must apply to those who are at the helm at the different levels of administration and management and it must include prosecutions. Otherwise the abuse will be perpetuated. I add those comments at this stage because that is the only fail-safe way of putting an end to the series of abuses that are being exposed on a daily basis whereby we see the full extent of the way the banking institutions, and particularly AIB which is the financial institution most in the public spotlight at this time, have been operating. I do not doubt for one moment that many of these abuses will yet be shown to have been replicated in the practice of other financial institutions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I take a different view of what penalties should be about. Their purpose should be two-fold, to punish the person or the institution for having done wrong, and to act as a mechanism for ensuring that that wrong does not recur. I am not certain that a financial penalty can ever penalise a financial institution because its stock-in-trade is to do more business, earn more money, and to replace the money lost in penalties. I do not believe they can be penalised financially.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker that this is probably only one of many cases that have yet to come to light. We have seen it in different institutions of the State and we are only starting to see the banking institutions begin to tumble, I hope not to the detriment of the country or the individual. In terms of penalties, the Regulator should have the power to put someone into an institution as soon as something like this is unearthed to report back over six to 12 months, and it should be done at the expense of the institution. Simply imposing a financial penalty might suit the financial institutions. It is a blinkered way of thinking and it is probably how the financial institutions want us to think. This <Col N="1548"/>is not just about penalising someone but about restoring confidence in the institutions and for people to see that there is someone in the institutions who is on their side and keeping a very close eye on matters over a period of time. Although I am not certain it will ever be possible, perhaps that person might be able to instil ethics into the financial world. This should be about accountability as well as restoring confidence. I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>The amendment overlooks the fact that the regulator has power, under section 33AQ, not only to impose a fine of up to &euro;5 million but to issue a direction to the institution to refund an amount of money charged to a customer. The fine of &euro;5 million is punitive in scope and there is always the power to direct a refund of money charged to a customer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that for granted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is a valuable power. It means the customer does not have to institute civil proceedings, be faced with the Statute of Limitations or go through the obstacle race of court proceedings. Let us suppose that a financial institution overcharges its customers. The first priority of the regulator will be to ensure that these customers are fully recompensed. As recent events have shown, the cost to the institution of such recompense could far exceed the maximum financial penalty of &euro;5 million, and rightly so. These events show that the regulator, even without the new powers in this Bill, has been able to use moral suasion to achieve this outcome.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has power by regulation to increase the maximum financial penalty should that appear desirable in the future. That flexibility is provided for in the legislation and, to that extent, the substance of the amendment is covered by the Bill. The Minister can increase the figure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments, by and large. My amendment is not robust and I really put it down to facilitate a debate on this. The Minister should look at the power he has reserved to himself to see what are the appropriate penalties in this instance. The objective of my proposal was that, in the case of impropriety, the institution would not only pay back X million euro but a further penalty of Y million euro would be exacted by the regulator. In the tax system, for example, 100% penalties are quite common in respect of certain types of non-compliance with tax law.</P>
    <P>A different view is taken in the Competition Act. In that Act, penalties can be related to turnover, so there is a high threat involved to the institution if it is in breach of the Act. Perhaps the Minister feels we are not yet in a position to provide for penalties of that scale in the system. If that is the case, the Minister should indicate that he will institute a review of what would constitute appropriate penalties, particularly in <Col N="1549"/>light of current ongoing experiences, and decide whether there is cause to reconsider the maximum penalty provided for in this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of &euro;5 million is the limit for the direct punishment. It is a punitive figure and is very high. However, there are many different types of financial institution. It would be difficult to envisage circumstances where a fine of this level would be reasonably imposed on a small financial institution, such as an intermediary or a credit union. A balance must be struck. That we have provided for a maximum fine and for an element of ministerial discretion in the future meets the need at this stage.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment is not sufficiently robust. If it were, I would press it. I accept that this might be an appropriate penalty structure for the financial impropriety we have seen but there are many other types of impropriety for which it would not be appropriate. However, the Minister should assure the House now that he will review the penalties in light of recent experience and if it is appropriate to have penalties related to turnover, he will take that option. That would demonstrate that we are serious about these issues. Does the Minister not feel able to make such a commitment?</P>

    <P FLI="0">These amendments, which relate to the Investment Intermediaries Act, arise mainly from concerns expressed by Deputy Richard Bruton on Committee Stage. They are mainly technical in nature. The only substantive amendment relates to section 28 of the Act. Amendment No. 120 narrows the obligation on a product producer, such as a bank or an insurance company, to monitor the activities of an intermediary appointed by it. The obligation will now only apply if the regulatory authority issues a specific direction to the product producer to monitor the activities of specific intermediary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 123 would remove the requirement for an annual audit from certain categories of intermediaries. Such an audit is an important independent assurance of an intermediary&rsquo;s financial soundness and compliance with regulatory requirements. Amendment No. 124 would weaken the current requirement that where an insurance agency held by a broker is discontinued for any reason, such a fact should be publicised. This amendment seeks to create a potential exclusion from this provision. This would be undesirable from a consumer protection perspective.

    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) an agreement for the provision of credit to a person on the security of a mortgage of a freehold or leasehold estate or interest in land on which a house is constructed where the house is to be used, or to continue to be used, as the principal residence of the person or the person&rsquo;s dependants, or</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) an agreement for the provision of credit to a person on the security of a mortgage of a freehold or leasehold estate or <Col N="1555"/>interest in land on which a house is, or is to be, constructed where the person to whom the credit is provided is a consumer;&ldquo;;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment. It inserts a paragraph which was omitted in error when the new definition of housing loan was inserted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The policy objective in inserting the new definition was to provide that all loans secured on the family home, including those made for commercial purposes, should come within the scope of Part 9 of the Consumer Credit Act. Without this amendment loans for commercial purposes secured on the family home would not be covered.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 128 amends sections 12, 149 and 149A in order to bring contraventions of the Consumer Credit Act provisions relating to the notification and approval of bank charges within the scope of the offence provisions of that Act. This would remedy a deficiency in the Act which has existed since it came into force in 1996. The deficiency has been highlighted by recent events in the banking sector of which Deputies are fully aware.</P>
    <P>Following the amendment, a financial institution that charges its customers in excess of the rates notified to the financial regulator will be subject to the penalties provided for in the Consumer Credit Act. In addition, with this amendment, it will be easier for the regulator to use its new powers under section 10 to impose significant penalties directly on such an institution and to order a refund of fees incorrectly charged to customers.</P>
    <P>Section 120 also amends section 116 of the Act. This amendment responds to a concern raised by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage relating to the requirement that mortgage intermediaries secure a new authorisation each year. Intermediaries authorised under the Investment Intermediaries Act, including insurance intermediaries, do not require annual authorisation. The amendment gives the regulatory authorities the discretion to issue authorisations to mortgage intermediaries for longer than a year, subject to compliance with additional conditions laid down by the authority. The amendment addresses the point raised by Deputy Bruton in amendment No. 127. Amendment No. 134 is a saving provision.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment No. 126 would be to exclude a major category of mortgage introducers from the new definition of mortgage intermediary in page 185 of the Bill. If the regulation of mortgage introducers is being introduced in the Bill on the recommendation of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Minister is not disposed to creating such an exclusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome amendment No. 128, which introduces a penalty for overcharging in excess of the provisions laid down. This power was inherited from the Central Bank Acts. It is <Col N="1556"/>extraordinary that over all these twists and turns, and in the course of a four-year review of best practice in regard to regulation and dozens of years of practice in applying these powers, no one twigged the fact that they had no power to enforce all the requirements they were making on the financial institutions. If indicates that the complexity of the legislation appears to have caught out those who drafted it in that they created an obligation but created no sanction for failing to honour the obligation. However, it is better late than never.</P>

	<P>On amendment No. 125 and the definition of &lsquo;housing loan&rsquo; paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) specify to have a house constructed on the land, to improve a house that is already used as, and for the purpose of enabling a person to buy a house that is already constructed. What about someone buying a house that has yet to be constructed, which is not catered to in paragraph (i)? The pattern today invariably is that properties are sold prior to construction and from the plans as presented. The phraseology in paragraph (iii) which states &ldquo;is already constructed&rdquo; suggests exclusion of the definition of housing loan as that applying to a mortgage secured to purchase a house that has yet to be constructed or is under construction, which is the case in the majority of mortgage applicants&rsquo; proposals where they are buying off the plans. This is very much the pattern today. Will the Minister of State clarify if there is a deficiency in the wording and an area that applies to many proposees for mortgages?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I clarify that we have recommitted these amendments but we have not come out of committee proceedings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the key point is that the family home falls within the definition of the Act, not just to a person who has bought property. If it is a family home, the type of transaction referred to by the Deputy is captured in the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation is language in precision and there is no precision in this respect. The amendment seeks to define &ldquo;housing loan&rdquo; and it is quite specific. It refers to having a house constructed on the land, either improving a house that is already used or buying a house that is already constructed. Paragraph (i) does not cover the area I am addressing. Is there a deficiency in the wording? Does it require revisitation? I am not seeking to trip up the Minister or those who drafted the legislation, but I am trying to point out that if there is a deficiency in terms of the construction of the language, it would need to be addressed in the Seanad. A great number of people buying a house today buy from the plans while the house is not constructed. The language in the amendment <Col N="1557"/>appears to exclude a number of people, therefore I believe it merits revisitation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised it does not require revisitation because the wording is broad enough. &ldquo;Housing loan&rdquo; means an agreement for the provision of credit to a person on the securing of a mortage of a freehold or leasehold estate or interest in land, including for the purpose of enabling the person to have a house constructed on the land as the principal resident or that person&rsquo;s dependants.</P>

	<P>If the Minister of State and his officials are happy the wording is broad enough I sincerely hope it is. The reason I raised the matter is that if it is not sufficiently broad, it will cause a problem for people seeking a mortgage in the situation I have described. However, if the Minister and his officials believe there is no concern, I will accept that. I hope I am not proved correct.</P>

<Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P FLI="0">I am delighted to speak on this motion and to compliment the Minister on a job well done since he came to office. Ireland is the only country in the EU to have a Minister and a Department specially for community and rural affairs. This shows how serious the Government is in its commitment to rural communities. The Minister has proved his commitment to these communities and to marginalised communities that heretofore did not have the resources to do things for themselves.</P>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="5">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I represent a constituency in Mayo on the western seaboard that is far removed from Dublin where the major decisions are made. In recent years I have seen the benefit of the CL&Aacute;R programme which has helped many communities in Mayo to help themselves. CL&Aacute;R was set up to help those communities that had been ravaged by emigration and other factors so that its population had fallen by more than 50% since the turn of the 20th century. Through the injection of capital, the CL&Aacute;R programme has helped in such areas as roads, water schemes, small sewerage schemes and health centres.</P>
    <P>I recently had the pleasure to accompany the Minister to Clare Island and Inisturk off the Mayo coast and to witness the great satisfaction people had in their new water supply schemes. They also pointed to the improvements in the roads and the new piers to be built on both islands. A new health centre was opened that day in Inisturk at a cost of &euro;380,000. The services included a public health nurse, GP services, speech and language therapy and others. I also compliment Mayo County Council for its input and on working closely with the Minister and his Department to have the schemes developed.</P><Col N="1567"/>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland is real and the icing on the cake is the transfer of the Minister&rsquo;s Department to Knock Airport, which Fianna F&aacute;il built in the 1980s, under the decentralisation programme. The top-up of grants from the CL&Aacute;R programme has helped enormously. The airport is now doing very well and is set to do better. It is a vital piece of infrastructure for Mayo and the Government will do everything possible in further development. The transfer of the Department to Knock will revitalise towns such as Charlestown, Swinford, Kilkelly and Kiltimagh and the other small towns of east and south Mayo. The decentralisation programme will bring a huge boost to Claremorris, when 150 jobs from the Office of Public Works are relocated there. This is a huge commitment to a rural county. There will be 290 real jobs in the area and a spin-off from those transferring there.</P>
    <P>This will benefit the GAA and soccer clubs as well as our small schools. Small businesses will also benefit. The sporting clubs that received allocations from Lotto funding are now set to get a top-up of 20% from the CL&Aacute;R programme. That is worth about &euro;170,000 extra for Mayo this year. There is not a town or village, from Charlestown to Blacksod, from Ballycastle to Shrule, that has not benefited from the programme. This is real and practical help to complete projects that people have initiated themselves.</P>
    <P>The rural social scheme initiated by the Minister is now ready and there are many aspects to it that will further enhance rural towns and villages. The aims of the scheme are to provide income support for farmers and fishermen who are currently in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, and to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities. This scheme will allow those low-income farmers and fishermen who are unable to earn an adequate living from their small farm holding or fishing to earn a supplementary income. The intention of the rural social scheme is that all of the work undertaken will be beneficial to the local community.</P>
    <P>The type of project carried out under this scheme is likely to include maintaining and enhancing marked ways, agreed walks and bog roads, energy conservation work for the elderly and less well-off, village and countryside enhancement projects, social care and care of the elderly, community care for pre-school and after school groups, environmental maintenance work, maintenance and caretaking of community and sporting facilities, projects relating to not-for-profit cultural and heritage centres, and any other appropriate community project identified during the course of the scheme. The work will last 19.5 hours per week and these hours will be based on a farmer and fisherman-friendly schedule.</P>
    <P>There will be great benefits brought to the communities. They will provide additional resources to maintain and improve local <Col N="1568"/>amenities and facilities in rural communities. Communities will benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen. Participants will experience opportunities to improve existing skills or develop new skills, and perform work in the community. Additional F&Aacute;S places will become available as farmers and fishermen transfer from CE to rural social schemes. I compliment the Minister on the job he has done so well and I hope he continues with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. I compliment the Minister because no Government has done as much for rural Ireland as this Government has done in recent years. There have been initiatives such as the CL&Aacute;R programme and the rural housing guidelines and decentralisation. There has been a major change of heart to bring funds to the less developed areas that have lost large chunks of population through rural decline. For a long time we had witnessed parishes losing people yet now we look around and all we see is development and this has to be welcomed. It is a long way from the 1980s when we were shipping people out of the country. Now we are bringing them in. Long may that continue and I compliment the Minister on his understanding of rural issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a serious issue that has developed in the area of the Cork-Kerry-Limerick border over the past few days, namely, the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse planning permission for a wind farm at Knockacummer, Meelin, County Cork. This project was turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la because it is in a special area of conservation for the hen harrier, an issue that arose approximately 18 months ago. Cork County Council granted permission for the project in its report, clearly stating it had no objection to it. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said it had no objection to the proposed development. An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which I accept is an independent body, appears to have gone against the direct policy of the Government and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>That is a serious issue because Governments are elected to govern. They are appointed by the people in general elections and by the D&aacute;il. The policy of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is that it had no objection to the proposed development yet An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned it down. This development had major economic implications for a rural area with mountain terrain which is very dependent on forestry and on this development going ahead. It will have a knock-on effect in regard to other developments in the area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is an issue the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should clarify but my point is that throughout the country, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is making decisions and it is answerable to nobody. It is time that <Col N="1569"/>bodies making decisions of this magnitude are made answerable to the people. I cited the observation of the Department yet An Bord Plean&aacute;la appears to have gone against the Department&rsquo;s policy, and that is a serious issue for democracy.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Minister and his Department on the work they are doing in regard to rural Ireland and their grasp of the issues. I wish the Minister well in the continuation of his work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity we do not have more time to speak on this motion because there is much more we could say about it. A motion criticising the Minister directly or indirectly is totally unwarranted because in his Ministry he has proved that he is dealing with the problems of people in rural Ireland. I am concerned that some people may now believe that rural Ireland is progressing too fast for their liking. That is something that annoys me.</P>
    <P>I want to make two or three points, the first of which concerns CL&Aacute;R funding. We have all seen the benefits of CL&Aacute;R funding in that third class rural roads are now getting funding. That is a positive development for the people in rural Ireland who have to use those roads, and the Minister is to be complimented on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The top-ups from CL&Aacute;R with regard to roads and local improvement schemes and, this week, sports projects, are of enormous benefit to the communities of rural Ireland. They are giving them the incentive and the funding to ensure that local communities remain vibrant and active in the provision of facilities in the area.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is mentioned in the motion. We are now seeing people objecting to decentralisation on the basis that certain areas of rural Ireland should not be involved. That is totally wrong. It is not right that some Members make one comment here but then say the direct opposite in their constituencies and criticise the Government for not having done more regarding decentralisation.</P>
    <P>This Government has taken the decisions on decentralisation and it will implement them. Those who are affected will find that their quality of life and standard of living will be much improved by moving to rural Ireland than it is currently in Dublin. They will not face hours driving to and from work or the other social problems that exist in this city. They will have an opportunity to rear their families in the country, have a good education service and all the facilities of rural Ireland available to them within a few miles.</P>
    <P>Motions such as this, which try to embarrass Ministers, do not serve any useful purpose with regard to the workings of this House. It is more important that we come in here with constructive, not destructive, motions such as this one.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled to criticise many of the major initiatives that have been successful in rural <Col N="1570"/>Ireland. It criticises rural development bodies such as Leader but Leader has done a tremendous job. Those who act on Leader boards give tremendous service to their communities. Through the Leader programme the Minister has made funding available to many groups throughout the country for industrial projects. I refer in particular to funding recently given through Leader to a project in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, which made the difference between the project succeeding and not succeeding. In many cases people do not realise that we do not have enough intervention by Ministers with regard to the disbursement of funds. I say that without fear of anyone saying to me that Ministers should not have the power to disburse funds.</P>
    <P>Governments are elected to run the country and Ministers should have much more latitude with regard to how they spend money. They are answerable to this House in terms of the spending of that money and in all my years here I have not yet seen any Minister challenged on spending money in rural Ireland. We have had criticism on occasions that there has not been enough direct intervention.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the initiative he took with regard to rural housing. That is the most beneficial decision taken by this Government as far as the development of rural Ireland is concerned. Long may the Minister continue the policy he has started to implement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion but, unfortunately, we do not have enough time to make our contributions. The Opposition motion lacks any substance. I commend the Minister on the strong amendment he put before the House which outlines in some detail the new vibrancy in rural Ireland and the programmes he has introduced.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the CL&Aacute;R programme which has been the catalyst for many projects in the less developed parts of rural Ireland. The CL&Aacute;R funding allocated for the upgrading and rebuilding of class 3 roads is of particular importance to rural communities. Since 1997, Government policy has been about investing in rural Ireland and as I have said in this House on many occasions, the initiative to provide water and sewerage schemes in our smaller towns and villages has paid great dividends. It has ensured that those towns now have the capacity for housing programmes and local authorities throughout the country are now in a position to provide public housing schemes in smaller town and villages, thus ensuring that the less populated parishes now have a growing population which is of critical importance in ensuring communities remain vibrant.</P>
    <P>Any party that tables a motion of the type before the House must have no idea of what is happening in rural Ireland. Anybody who travels throughout the country will be aware of the vibrancy in rural Ireland. There are townlands <Col N="1571"/>populated today that did not have people living in them for many decades. There are job opportunities throughout the country. The road network has been rebuilt. Houses are being built in huge numbers in every parish in every county, and it ill behoves any Opposition party or Deputy to put down a motion which lacks substance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been innovative in his Department. He has brought forward schemes and addressed the lacunae with regard to many schemes as they applied to rural Ireland, and particularly to rural development. We have been fortunate in the Border counties because with some of the cross-Border funding available we have been able to develop enterprise centres. The Minister is anxious to build on that development to ensure that workspace is provided in our smaller towns and villages to act as a catalyst for further job creation. I hope the Minister will be able to expand the present limited scheme to provide a greater network of enterprise centres throughout all of our smaller towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to commend the Minister on his work. The people of rural Ireland, who live in the real world, know the value of the schemes and investment being brought to our rural communities through the work of his Department, through his innovation and through the work of all our Ministers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyDempseyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm glacadh leis an tseans seo labhairt faoin obair &iacute;ontach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agus at&aacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s ag an Aire. It is a privilege and pleasure to thank the Minister and to congratulate him on the wonderful work he has done to revitalise and sustain rural life. Many of his initiatives are inspirational, innovative and too numerous to mention. I have a list of approximately 15 initiatives but I will speak about just a few.</P>
    <P>The publication of the draft rural guidelines for housing recognised the need and right of people to live in rural Ireland. At a time when others might have sought to urbanise the countryside, the Minister&rsquo;s inspiration has facilitated planning. Those of us who come from rural Ireland and live there, as I do, are familiar with the planning difficulties experienced prior to his initiative. The rural social scheme provides employment for farmers who were under-employed or were finding difficulty sustaining their livelihood. The Minister has demonstrated his commitment to Leader and CL&Aacute;R. The Government has made record investment in sewerage services, roads and infrastructure, generally. One could go on.</P>
    <P>Schools with more than 12 pupils have been given a second teacher. Life in rural Ireland has always centred around the village school. Many Governments would have allowed schools with fewer than 12 pupils to be forgotten about but this Government has invested heavily in education. In my own county of Wexford, approximately &euro;20 million will be spent on school buildings this year. In 1997, the previous <Col N="1572"/>Government spent a little more than that on all the 26 counties of Ireland. This year&rsquo;s investment is a record. Rural schools deserve that investment and they have been given it. Between 1998 and 2004, approximately &euro;2 billion has been spent on schools and on education. We now have an educated populace who are able to travel the world and to take up employment in any part of it. I was among the first in my home place to go to second level school. It is a different story today when young people travel to schools in their thousands.</P>
    <P>The problems now experienced by rural Ireland are those associated with the success of the initiatives fostered by &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v agus ag an Rialtas f&eacute;in. We see huge pressure of overcrowding in primary and second level schools because more people are living in rural Ireland than ever before. It is important that we continue to address this problem and to invest large sums of money in education. It is vital that these initiatives continue.</P>
    <P>The success of rural Ireland has always been tied to people&rsquo;s emotional belief in living in the best place possible. Members may be aware of my affiliation with the GAA. I am proud of the fact that rural clubs compete at the highest level and have managed to take all-Ireland titles in the club championship. This is symptomatic of our emotional pride, which the Minister has nurtured through his various initiatives.</P>
    <P>Many years of under-investment in schools is being tackled. The small schools initiative, which allows the building of 20 extra rural schools under the auspices of boards of management, has been extended to allow for the building of 50 schools.</P>
    <P>D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfainn m&oacute;r&aacute;n eile a r&aacute; faoi thoradh oibre an Aire. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an t-Aire ann agus gur fada go raibh s&eacute; ann.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this motion and to compliment the Minister on his extraordinary positive input into rural Ireland, the west and, particularly, my county of Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is the first Minister for many decades to have felt the pulse of rural Ireland and to have applied the medicine. His tenure in office has been an outstanding success. Every village and community in rural Ireland has benefited from the initiatives brought forward by him. These include public water supply, small sewerage schemes, roads and local improvement schemes, CL&Aacute;R funding, top-up sports grants and the decentralisation of Departments to county towns. My county town of Roscommon is to benefit from the presence of 230 civil servants when the land registry section of the Department is located there. Under the Minister, Leader has been reformed and has been a success. I invite Deputies to take a trip this summer to visit the Arigna Mining Experience and to see what has been done in an area which was depressed due to the closure of the mine. Thousands of people now come every year to visit the Arigna Mining <Col N="1573"/>Experience. That would not have been possible without the rural initiative measure and Leader funding provided though the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
    <P>In years to come, people will talk about the Minister for his stand on rural housing and planning against those who had other interests. He was the first to stand and be counted on this important issue. I am glad that a subsequent ministerial decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is implementing the stand taken by the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. He is also respected by the farming community for his introduction of the rural social scheme, which gives dignity to those who cannot make a living from their family farms. Those farmers will now have an opportunity to complement their incomes from farming in a way which gives them dignity. The Minister is being complimented throughout the country but particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The motion is a cheap political shot which has no basis in fact or substance. The like of it should never have been placed on the Order Paper of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The Minister is identified with rural renewal and development, and the people respect him for what he has done.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to say a few words on rural development. No Government has done more for rural development than the present Government. It has set up a Department with special responsibility for rural development, islands and Gaeltacht affairs. The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has worked hard at this Ministry to ensure that rural development gets the recognition it deserves.</P>
    <P>Great work is being done under the CL&Aacute;R programme in rural areas where populations have declined. Projects such as rural roads, water schemes and communities in general have benefited under that programme. The recent announcement by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, of the establishment of the rural social scheme will be of great assistance to small farmers who cannot earn an income from farming alone. It will also enhance villages and communities through the work undertaken by those involved. Unlike the community employment scheme, there is no three-year cap on participants. All that is required is that such people be in receipt of social welfare and have a herd number.</P>
    <P>Rural planning is another area for which the Government has introduced guidelines. I welcome the guidelines regarding once-off housing in rural areas. The current trend is to refuse locals planning permission to build in their own area. Under the new guidelines proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, all farmers and families of landowners will be permitted to build on family lands. In addition, local people, those <Col N="1574"/>working in the area and returned emigrants will obtain planning permission to build in their area.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to build settlement areas around villages in rural Ireland. All of these proposals will ensure the viability of local schools and communities. It will be necessary to provide water and sewerage schemes in these rural villages if these plans are to work and this work will be done. The Government proposals on decentralisation will bring life to rural communities. Many civil servants will avail of the wonderful quality of life in rural Ireland. The proposal to develop the western rail corridor is another boost to rural communities in this area. People will be able to live in rural Ireland and commute to urban areas to work by way of fast commuter trains, thereby avoiding all traffic. Thanks to this Government and in particular the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, people in rural Ireland can look forward to better services and better rural communities.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Upton.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm labhairt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar an tuath agus ar chursa&iacute; forbartha tuaithe, &aacute;bhar at&aacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach na laethanta seo. T&aacute; a l&aacute;n le d&eacute;anamh chun deimhin a dh&eacute;anamh de go mbeidh saol na tuaithe ag dul ar aghaidh go maith ins na laethanta at&aacute; amach romhainn. I wish to focus on a number of issues which present a real threat to rural communities in Ireland, namely, the ongoing threat to postal services across the country, the inadequate roll-out of broadband to the regions and the lack of a synchronised transport system.</P>
    <P>Rural communities are threatened by ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of postal services in Ireland. The Government is content to let An Post go to ruin to the extent it will claim it had little option but to sell it off to the highest bidder. The current situation at An Post is nothing less than a disgrace. The company is haemorrhaging jobs at an unprecedented rate yet the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, refuses to intervene to restructure the company and secure its future.</P>
    <P>The public&rsquo;s automatic right to send and receive mail by post is under threat. If we continue on the present ruinous path, deregulation will be forced upon us by a Government which will claim it as the only way to secure the future of An Post. It will allow large companies from Europe and beyond to come in and cherry-pick the best of An Post&rsquo;s services leaving the next day delivery and other day-to-day delivery services languishing to the detriment of the overwhelming majority of Irish people who rely on these services. Standard deliveries to rural areas are already completely unreliable. An Post has been bedevilled by a series of industrial disputes that have yet to be satisfactorily unresolved. The threat of future strike action is omnipresent.</P><Col N="1575"/>
    <P>Meanwhile, rural post offices are closing at an alarming rate. People living in these areas are dependent on the post office for collection of their social welfare or pension payments. For most of them, the only place they can receive their payments is the post office. Transferring these facilities to an alternative post office may be acceptable in large cities but it is not acceptable in rural areas. The nearest post office may be miles away in the next village, town, or in some cases, the next island. The privatisation of postal services must be opposed as it will be bad for the general user. It is obvious the postal services on which private operators will have their eye are those on which excessive charges can be levied and from which money is to be made.</P>
    <P>Who will take care of the pensioner living in an isolated area who relies on the weekly trip to the local post office to draw his or her pension? With deregulation of the postal service will come open competition. Currently good business in urban areas is subsidising services in rural and more isolated areas. When deregulation is introduced, the big players will take away the best business and the subsidisation of the next-day service will no longer exist. I fear for what that will do to rural areas. We have no idea how long it will take items of post to move in and out of rural areas.</P>
    <P>As post offices around the country close, elderly members of our community and people with disabilities will find it difficult to collect their pensions and payments, resulting in a significant number of them becoming isolated. Nothing destroys a community more than isolation. For many, the weekly trip to the post office is a social lifeline and we should do all in our power to retain it. Many people are so far removed from public transport they are forced to depend on help from neighbours or are forced to pay for taxis to bring them to collect their pension or payments. We should be looking at ways to counteract this. One way of doing so is through the synchronisation of transport in rural areas so people are able to get to their post office.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the introduction of extra transport facilities on payment days. This situation presents a real difficulty for people in rural Ireland. It is obvious not enough is being done in terms of the synchronisation of transport. It is imperative that collection services be provided on the days pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments are made. In that regard, what I have in mind is the provision of mini-buses which would collect people at a particular time, bring them to the designated office to obtain their payment, allow them sufficient time to transact their business and return them to their local area at a fixed time.</P>
    <P>I shudder to think what will happen to many elderly people if rural post offices continue to close. Although a facility exists whereby people can appoint a particular person to collect their <Col N="1576"/>pension, many elderly people are extremely private about such matters. They should not be prevented from transacting their business as they wish. To prevent them doing so, takes away an element of their independence. I am not satisfied the Government is serious about tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that real investment now be directed at bringing Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications and broadband structures up to date. New technology means that an increasing number of people are able to work from home. Increasingly, businesses will locate in regional areas where overheads are cheaper, as long as the technological infrastructure is in place to allow them to work properly.</P>
    <P>Eircom has conceded that 22% of households on phone lines need to be urgently upgraded for broadband. Other telecommunications experts argue this figure is closer to 40%. Ireland is already lagging behind the rest of the world. The national grid must be enhanced and upgraded as soon as possible to allow larger numbers to gain access to broadband facilities.</P>
    <P>Significant investment of at least &euro;1 billion is needed as soon as possible to provide the last mile to individual households. This is necessary if Ireland is to halt its faltering position in broadband and related technologies. The technological advance of broadband has the potential to change the way we live and work and to revitalise the regions. However, to reap its benefits we must invest heavily in it to bring Ireland up to the highest international standards.</P>
    <P>Clearly, massive annual investment in the national landline network is necessary to avoid falling hopelessly behind in broadband and related technology. The fallout from the appallingly misguided privatisation of our national telecommunications backbone is continuing and the Government has continued to stand on the sidelines and allow the problem worsen.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of rural areas and rural life that are regrettable. Increasingly, because of the shortage of priests in the Catholic Church, for example, parishes will be without a curate. This affects many people&rsquo;s spiritual lives. We cannot blame the Government <i>per se</i> for this but I am using it as an example of how the support structures in rural areas are diminishing. People need shelter, heat, light and food. They also need to have a decent social and spiritual content to their lives. They need bread but they need roses also.</P>
    <P>The creation of culturally vibrant communities will not happen of itself. There are remarkable communities throughout the country but they need to have the highest possible level of self-sufficiency. We must seek not only to maintain the maximum number of people in rural areas but also do everything to prevent emigration and encourage immigration.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the new technologies. In the banking sector, for example, there have been <Col N="1577"/>various closures of smaller branches throughout the country. Basically, technology has provided people with alternatives. One can put one&rsquo;s card into a hole in the wall and withdraw money. There are many other technological services that allow one to pay one&rsquo;s bills, thus implying that technology gradually took over the role of those who worked in the small branches throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have had closures of small Garda barracks and schools. One indicator that really demonstrates rural decline is the inability of parishes to field teams for Gaelic games or other sports. Teams give areas a sense of identity and people take pride in the achievements of their teams. If teams can no longer be fielded, it will also result in the decline of rural areas.</P>
    <P>However, I remain optimistic although I have certain reservations. I will always remember my grandmother, who died in the mid-1960s. When she first got a television, when RTE was set up, I remember her saying that since that old box came into the house, nobody talked. The development of multichannel and pay-for-view television has had a detrimental effect on the art of conversation in rural areas. There is a danger that a plastic-type society will develop. By this, I am implying that many youngsters spend far too much time operating computers, playing video games and watching television programmes. They are being denied the great advantage of learning by doing. They become passive in their lifestyles, which is certainly not to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is also a great need to increase the number of garda&iacute; and improve conditions in rural areas because it is sad to have to say that rural Ireland is not as pleasant a place in which to grow old as it once was. We have not had the worst types of attacks on the elderly for some time and I hope this trend will continue. For all this, older people do not feel as secure as they felt when I was growing up and in the period immediately thereafter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. What I consider to be the miserable attempts of the Government to portray the Labour Party as the enemy of rural areas, and the farming community in particular, are not worthy of any serious debate. Twice in the past week the spin doctors of Fianna F&aacute;il in particular have tried to imply that the Labour Party is hostile to the farming community and rural areas. It must be emphasised, for the benefit of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is not present, that the Labour Party is not opposed to direct farm income support.</P>
    <P>I was born and went to school in rural Ireland. I am as proud of my roots and as concerned for the community from which I originated as I am proud of and concerned for my constituents in Dublin South-Central. Therefore, to imply that the Labour Party is not concerned about rural Ireland and the farming community is inaccurate and misleading.</P><Col N="1578"/>
    <P>The real hostility to rural Ireland and the farming community in particular is delivered by this Government through its failure to plan, invest in research and technology and address the real needs of rural dwellers. It always capitulates to the interests of the strong and powerful and the lobby groups at the cost of those less able to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of the State&rsquo;s total population of almost 4 million live in rural areas. The reality, however, is that agriculture will not be sufficient to keep them on the land. The development of rural areas and the stabilisation of their populations require an extension of policies beyond agriculture towards more diversified forms of rural development. Devoting resources to improving infrastructure and providing attractive conditions in rural areas for other sectors is an imperative that has not been addressed in a structured or substantial way and certainly has not been delivered on for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that rural communities are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the changing consumer-led landscape. Agriculture and rural development could be combined with fisheries and the environment, for example, in respect of Structural Funds, There is a need to implement targeted programme to address social exclusion, serious income problems, social and economic isolation, poor infrastructure and limited employment opportunities. The current policy does not do so.</P>
    <P>The continuous reduction of agricultural employment may have major consequences for the viability of rural regions unless sufficient alternative jobs can be provided. It is now time to concentrate on other issues in the rural economy and, while not ignoring agriculture, to look forward and plan for enterprise development, the marketing of local or regional brands, various high-tech initiatives, e-learning links, etc. The development of successful initiatives is imperative for the future competitiveness and success of rural economies.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has always supported the development of alternative enterprises and the provision of technical support by way of training and advice for the production and marketing of all these services. Many farmers and other rural entrepreneurs will need to begin to consider innovative activities such as agritourism, quality production, nature and landscape management, forestry and organic farming as responses to the ongoing cost and price squeeze on production-based agriculture. The Government has failed to plan and introduce the structures and supports to deliver on this.</P>
    <P>Diversification within and more significantly beyond the agriculture sector will become essential for rural economies to compete. In this area the Government has failed miserably to provide for the future of a vibrant rural community that is safe and secure, has a <Col N="1579"/>dependable source of income and is forward-looking. I listened to Deputy Tony Dempsey waxing lyrical about the village school. He seems to be somewhat out of touch with the reality of rural Ireland and village schools. It now seems to be about number crunching. If numbers dip by one or two, there is a real risk of a school being closed or the loss of a teacher. The Deputy is surely thinking of a romantic Ireland when talking about the village school and the commitment of the Government to ensure the viability of such important local provision of services.</P>
    <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea referred to the post offices, policing and public transport, which are all so crucial to a good quality of life in rural Ireland. The elimination of many of the rural post offices has denuded the countryside and the community of one of their most important social outlets. These closures are ongoing and the problem is getting worse. Anybody who has lived in rural Ireland, particularly in isolated parts, will be more than conscious and concerned about the lack of policing. Many elderly people in isolated places live in a constant state of fear because of the lack of local policing. Again many local Garda stations are being closed.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, I support this motion, on which my colleague, Deputy Boyle, spoke yesterday. It highlights the need to focus on the plight of many rural communities. From his life before politics, the Minister has considerable experience in this area. I hope we can be constructive and have a useful discourse on the matter this evening. The principles and policy of the Green Party are based on decision making at the lowest effective level. To that extent communities and their viability represent where we believe society is most efficiently and sustainably organised.</P>
    <P>In countries like Latvia where the Prime Minister is from the Green Party, which is in coalition with the farmers&rsquo; union, rural <Col N="1580"/>development is at the heart of many of the policies pursued by Green parties internationally as well as here. I have travelled the country as party leader and seen some good examples of rural development and some areas where there was considerable deprivation and where I hope lessons will have been learned.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus on the positive elements where possible. When I was near Malin Head meeting the Green Party representative in Donegal, Dr. Peter Doran, it was very satisfying to see in spite of the hard times as a result of the demise of Fruit of the Loom, a great synergy existed between the Green Party there, a local entrepreneur and a new company, Forward Emphasis, which employs more than 100 people in the old Fruit of the Loom premises. This emphasises the opportunity for rural people to embrace new technology. With better broadband access there as in many parts of the country it would be possible to create even more employment in the area. Lack of broadband access has been a limiting factor and I hope the Government will increase its focus on rural development and particularly on broadband access.</P>
    <P>In developing and even saving many rural communities, we need to recognise the writing on the wall. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said in a news report today how important oil is for transportation. I urge the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to make that point strongly about rural communities. Without public transport, local Garda stations, schools and markets, rural communities will be very seriously disadvantaged because of their high car dependency. This is not a matter of choice but one of reality. Unless the Government takes a long-term view, it is sentencing people to a very uncertain and expensive future rather than protecting rural communities and their viability.</P>
    <P>Although I do not need to tell the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs about Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s original policy of retaining as many families as possible in rural Ireland, unfortunately it is not working. More farm families are leaving the land. Even though rural populations are increasing slightly, many of them are long-distance commuters unable to engage with their rural community in the way family farmers might have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Government policy needs to stop dumping on rural communities with huge regional landfill dumps. A large incinerator is proposed for Carranstown, County Meath. Just because these are situated in rural areas, does not mean they do not affect people. Some sections of Government seem to believe they can get away with locating these facilities in a rural area because it does not affect as many people politically and is not as vote-sensitive. That thinking must stop and we need to maximise self-reliance in terms of waste and providing for needs in local communities in <Col N="1581"/>both urban and rural areas rather than dumping on the rural community.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion. I am involved in politics because there have been such problems. There has been a vicious circle and it is quite obvious in rural areas that if we lose services we will lose people. Many years ago I pointed out that if the population fell to a level at which a doctor was not replaced, people were less likely to stay in that area. The same is true where there is no post office, Garda presence to offer protection from marauding criminals or other services. Dispensing by rural doctors only happens in areas where a pharmacy is not viable. At one stage in its wisdom the Government removed that responsibility but quickly restored it because of the furore from the people. That was a good example of bad policy for sustaining populations in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I have been very much involved in supporting older people in their own community, which has been a very powerful economic regenerator. West of a line from Killala to Newport every district electoral division showed a population decrease. The exception was St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village in Mulranny, Newport east, which showed an increase because of the local infrastructure and because the village is the biggest employer. It underlines the point that if the infrastructure is provided, the people will remain in an area.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Funding for the Government&rsquo;s social housing plans is &euro;100 million below what it needs to be to meet the targets this year. Communities would be revived if people in long-stay institutions were brought back to them. Some 25% of people in long-stay institutions should not be there. I greatly encourage the provision of alternatives to keep them in their own communities to break the strong link between homelessness and a lack of local accommodation. People must leave their areas due to lack of accommodation. It is important to keep people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>On foot of the fight to retain the post offices at Carracastle, An Post had to re-examine its proposal. The provision of useful services like banking allowed the post office to remain in the area. The post office is the one element of An Post which is profitable. That shows how a situation can be turned around due to good policy. I must pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, above all his ministerial colleagues. He at least is trying hard. He comes from Cornamona in County Galway which is a rural area in which he worked at the coalface. The CL&Aacute;R programme is well intentioned and based on sound principles in addressing areas which have suffered severe depopulation. While that is how it should be, the programme does not have the budget it needs. It is very useful that the programme has less bureaucracy attached to it than others. It fits in with other schemes.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on what he has done for the islands in terms of access. It should <Col N="1582"/>have been done a long time ago. The Minister has had to deal with the consequences of the neglect of years. I would like him to do for the mainland what he has done for the islands. He should work for equality. I started a campaign a decade ago for an orthopaedic unit in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar which will not now open. It was supposed to open on 1 July, but sanction has not been given for the 60 staff who have been interviewed. They will not be given contracts. It is an example of a rural area being let down.</P>
    <P>The end of Mayo is as distant from Galway as Dublin but that is how far people must travel to receive a basic service. It is unacceptable. It is also unacceptable that 23 orthopaedic beds, 28 geriatric assessment beds, 28 elderly care beds and two palliative care beds lie idle simply because the Government will not sanction 30 nurses due to its embargo on recruitment. Meanwhile, 30 trolleys downstairs accommodate older people who should be upstairs in beds. They are not fit for nursing home beds.</P>
    <P>This issue is about local services. Where surgical and medical services are available locally, there are no waiting lists. There are massive waiting lists for ear, nose and throat services. In terms of orthopaedic waiting lists, 1,500 people are in limbo while 1,000 older people in Mayo are waiting for urology services. This is simply because there are no local consultants. The Hanly radiotherapy reports make recommendations against the provision of local services. There is a great onus on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as somebody who knows and cares to stop the rot. I acknowledge that the Minister is doing his best.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 was supposed to accomplish a great deal. In 2004, half way through the life of the plan, a report by Indecon and the ESRI shows the extent to which it is behind schedule, particularly in the west. The Indecon report concludes that there is no evidence of significant convergence between the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region. The plan is struggling to deliver and serious questions are being asked about value for money and the commitment of the Government to investing outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The final draft of the national spatial strategy was published in 2002 almost three years after the publication of the national development plan. That was behind time. There is little evidence that the national spatial strategy is having an impact in terms of balanced regional development or that there exists a clear idea on how to implement it. Broadband development and the strategic rail review appear to be incompatible with the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations. While record growth rates have been achieved nationally, the west continues to lag far behind. Balanced regional development makes great sense. It would benefit the country by stemming the migration to Dublin. Many years ago while the bishops were talking about depopulation and emigration, I flagged the <Col N="1583"/>migration of people to large urban centres. If one could keep people out of Dublin, the demand for housing there would be reduced and property would become more affordable. The pressure on infrastructure which is reduced to ass and cart pace would be relieved.</P>
    <P>To accomplish this requires a concerted effort to upgrade infrastructure. That is just not happening according to the review of the national development plan. It is unacceptable. In 2000, 9.8% of all new graduates with primary degrees were employed in the Galway, Mayo and Roscommon while 62% of them found work in Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. Is it acceptable that so many people from the west must go to Dublin to find jobs? People from the west do not want to be in Dublin. They want to be at home. They cannot stay in the west due to a lack of competitiveness and infrastructure which means the necessary jobs cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>Nationally, net industrial output growth from the mid to late 1990s averaged 19% per annum. The equivalent figure for the west was just over 7%. In 2000, the western region accounted for 7.5% of all industrial output in the State compared with the mid-west contribution of 12.5%, 26.7% in the Dublin region and 27.6% in the south west. Is there any point in providing further grants to industry in Dublin? Would it not be better to ensure that industries are developed in the west? Why should money be poured in to keep even more people in Dublin? It would make a great deal more sense to provide industry in the west.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office reported that disposable income in the west was 7.8% below the State average in 2001, which is below the figure in 2000. It is worsening all the time. While disposable income in Galway is 1.3% below the State average, it is 15.5% below in Mayo and 14.7% in Roscommon. It is evident that while Galway is improving, Mayo and Roscommon are slipping. They are rural areas which are doing worse. The average output level per person in the west is significantly below the national average at 23.8%, which represents an increase of less than 0.5% above the 1996 level. This is further evidence that the west is not attracting its share of high value added growth employment. The west is not doing well and that is where rural areas are for the most part.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is supposed to be the principal engine in the delivery of infrastructure through the economic and social infrastructure operational programme. It is generally accepted that the plan is failing to reach its targets. According to the Indecon mid-term evaluation of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, it was projected that &euro;858.3 million would be spent on the road network in the BMW region between 2000 and 2002. The actual expenditure was &euro;592.7 million. As a percentage of the operational programme forecasts, that was 69.1%.</P><Col N="1584"/>
    <P>If one compares that with the south and east region, the total spending projection there in 2000 to 2002 was &euro;1.4649 billion but the actual spend was &euro;2.0231 billion. If one looks at the expenditure as a percentage of operational programme forecast for the BMW region, the figure spent was 69.1% of the expected spend, but in the south and east the figure spent was 138.1% over the figure. That does not make sense to me. If one asks why our graduates must go to Dublin, that is the reason.</P>
    <P>The Westport to Dublin route, the N5, is the main national primary link to the east on which companies depend. I know that Allergan products are damaged in transit because of the state of the road. Given its importance to industry, why is there such a lack of emphasis on the route in the NDP? The National Roads Authority is not giving it the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>If one looks at efforts to improve the route, what has been involved is mere short-term upgrading. The Western Development Commission in its 2001 report recommended what the expenditure should be for each route in the region over the period 2000 to 2006. The recommended expenditure for the N5 over the six-year period was &euro;203 million. The figure spent fell far short of that, with the allocation for the period 2000 to 2003, half of the six-year period, being &euro;47 million. Being generous, one might say that just over twice that, some &euro;100 million, would be spent over the full six-year period, a figure far short of the recommended &euro;203 million. We are obviously not getting the priority we need and deserve. It is a question of equality rather than priority, and we are not getting equality.</P>
    <P>Looking at rail transport, the investment in public transport in the BMW region between 2000 and 2002 also fell far short of expectations. The total BMW projection was &euro;303 million while spending amounted to &euro;154 million, only 51% of the figure forecast for that period. In the south and east, the projected amount was &euro;271 million while the expenditure was &euro;471.9 million &mdash; twice the projected figure &mdash; while only half the projected figure was spent in the BMW area. Does that make sense? Is it any wonder we are in such a state in the west?</P>
    <P>This is the book that tells the story. I have a great deal of time for the Minister of State and I know he is trying very hard, but he must get the Government to try harder. We are losing the battle in the west.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The mission statement of my Department is to promote and support the sustainable development of communities, both urban and rural, including Gaeltacht and island communities. The Government demonstrated its support for rural communities by establishing the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. At the time the Taoiseach made it clear that the Government was placing a focus on <Col N="1585"/>communities, particularly those vulnerable and under threat. Since its inception the Department has played a key role in implementing programmes such as CL&Aacute;R and Leader and has responded to new and developing situations by the introduction of the rural social scheme and the establishment of Comhairle na Tuaithe. These measures combined with the provision of additional resources have played a significant part in improving the quality of life and opportunities for people.</P>
    <P>When the CL&Aacute;R programme was introduced in October 2001, there was wide consultation with everyone involved to identify their priorities. CL&Aacute;R is delivered under a number of measures and with great co-operation between all the agencies. The rural social scheme was launched a few weeks ago, has commenced in eight Leader areas and will be extended to many others within the next two months.</P>
    <P>The Department also hosted an important and successful conference earlier this week under the aegis of the European Presidency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There are too many conferences.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was agreed at the conference that EU rural development policy must focus on developing a living, thriving countryside based on development of the rural economy as a whole. It was also agreed that policy must continue to promote a sustainable and competitive farm sector and to focus on managing the land of Europe for future generations. Rural development is primarily about people and communities. We must listen to the people who live in rural areas. That is the key. We must listen to them and make policy to suit the people instead of trying to change people and the world to suit policy. We must continue to do what we can for rural communities. When we have stopped the haemorrhage of people from the countryside all over Europe and when our rural young people automatically expect to benefit from the same opportunities as their urban counterparts, we will then know that we have achieved a successful outcome.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long time coming.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It emerged from the conference that Ireland would be one of the leaders, but there is more to be done, to quote a famous saying. When we stop that haemorrhage and when young people expect the same in the countryside as in Dublin or other urban areas, we will then know that we have got it all right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that happen?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the meantime we should put young people first. I believe that the programmes we have clearly demonstrate the commitment of the Department to fulfilling our mission statement. That is what we are striving towards.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who have contributed to the debate which has been most informative and demonstrates that there is a wide area of agreement across party lines on the problems that face rural Ireland, despite the obligation that we all have to pick holes in each other&rsquo;s positions. It is regrettable that a small number of Deputies, Deputies Ellis and Smith in particular, are at variance with the Minister&rsquo;s position expressed last night when he commended Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing this motion before the House. Those two Deputies attacked Sinn F&eacute;in for doing so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with that. It was good that we had the debate but I do not agree with the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister commended Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a counter-motion prepared. We do not agree with the motion but we agree that it is good to debate rural issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>In Deputy Smith&rsquo;s case it may have more to do with being embarrassed that the leader of the Sinn F&eacute;in party in the House, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, comes from the same constituency as he.</P>
    <P>The drastic situation in rural Ireland deserves the attention of all Deputies, especially those of us who have firsthand knowledge of it. The Minister made an interesting contribution yesterday and we can all agree that he is passionately devoted to the future of rural communities. In drafting our motion, never once did we contemplate including what is often the obligatory demand that the Minister responsible for the area under discussion be asked to resign.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that halting the decline in rural communities has not been achieved by any other European or any other modern developed state. He is attempting to halt the Irish rural decline, a laudable aim, by means of a number of initiatives taken by him as Minister in a dedicated Department.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that his good intentions and the excellent work being carried out under his Department are being nullified by the overall thrust of Government policies. That is why our motion refers to the Government&rsquo;s failure rather than that of the Minister to ensure that the commitments made in the White Paper are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>It is not just the duty of every Minister to embrace the concept of rural development and regeneration. They must actively and positively contribute to addressing rural community needs, to reverse the trend of decline and not just pay it lip-service to it. It is my belief that the socially-progressive objectives of the Minister and many others within his own party are having to take second place to the dominant ideology within the Government, which is driven by what one might <Col N="1587"/>for simplicity&rsquo;s sake describe as a right-wing fiscal agenda. It is no coincidence that this is taking place at a time when the single most right-wing party in the State, the Progressive Democrats, is part of the governing coalition.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.7-?><P>There are without doubt fundamental differences between the world view of many within the Fianna F&aacute;il base and the PDs. That might be best exemplified by something that the Minister said last night when he spoke of the loss of the old co-operative spirit and the conviction that none of us is an island but that we exist interdependently with one another. One could contrast that with what his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said last week regarding the manner in which inequality acts as an incentive. He went on to claim that striving to eradicate social inequality would lead to a feudal society.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies from rural parts of this country will know, we are not too many generations removed from what was a feudal society. I can imagine that Lord Leitrim and other lords and gentry of his time might have gazed out of their windows and pondered how the enormous gap between themselves and their tenants, or how murdering, evicting or starving them, would spur them on to greater things &mdash; in other words, to produce more profits for the lords and gentry. It did spur them on; it motivated Irish tenants to get rid of the Lord Leitrims and the many parasites who thrived on the life blood of rural Ireland. Thatcher tried it in England. Milton Friedman&rsquo;s ideological economic position drove right-wing policies across the world and McDowellism is alive and well in this House. However, just as Thatcher, Pinochet and the Boers are in the dustbin of history, the policies of McDowellism, which are driving the current Government, will also be found there.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, shares his colleague&rsquo;s views or the PD&rsquo;s extreme attitude towards the role of the state. Individual initiative is crucial but private enterprise itself will never be sufficient to solve the problems facing rural communities. I think I am correct in saying that this view is shared by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another interesting issue raised by the Minister was in regard to the use of modulated funds. I would agree that all of these should not necessarily go directly back to individual producers. We made this point during the debate on CAP reform when we argued that the definition of rural development under CAP ought to be expanded beyond measures directly connected to production. There is a strong argument for directing some of the modulation funds into broader rural development and also that this should be matched by national government. The important thing is that all of the modulation funds are ring-fenced to the country of origin.</P>
    <P>There is scope to expand the CL&Aacute;R programme further. The Minister might consider including district electrical divisions that fit the <Col N="1588"/>population criteria but which are geographically separated from other district electrical divisions in the same position. I also believe that the underlying concept of CL&Aacute;R could be applied to cross-Border programmes where similar areas of disadvantage are divided by the Border. Of course, I would also hope that funding for the programme is increased in the next budget and not cut as was done previously.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment expresses support for the Western Development Commission but in practice it has ignored many of the recommendations made by the commission. In its blueprint for organic agrifood production in the west, the WDC pointed to the potential for organic production allied to higher value added processing for the export market but this has not been followed by the Government. In fact, it has cut the level of State support, training and support for the organic sector. Many of the recommendations of the WDC on the seafood sector were incorporated in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource&rsquo;s national strategy but very few have been implemented as sea landings continue to decline, hampered by the increasing restrictions imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>The fishing sector is probably the most neglected and abused sector of rural Ireland. Many who live in coastal areas have witnessed the decline of the industry with nothing done to reverse it. It is depressing when I return to my home port of Fenit to see so few people actively engaged in the fishing industry at present. This situation is mirrored all around the western and south-western coasts. We need a re-negotiation of the CFP to address the terrible imbalance inflicted upon those in our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Population forecasts predict that growth will be further concentrated in Dublin and the mid-east over the next 25 years, with 80% of growth taking place there. Something radical must be done to avoid this imbalance. I hope the Minister is right about decentralisation and that more proactive measures are taken to decentralise private sector as well as public sector jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also a clear imbalance in the location of jobs which are created with the assistance of the IDA. Despite the commitments made in the national spatial strategy, the so-called hub centres have not proved sufficient to attract new foreign companies. As Deputy Morgan pointed out, most of them have actually experienced increased unemployment since 2002. The Tralee-Killarney hub is one example. In 2002, there were 3,512 people on the live register. In April of this year, this had increased to 3,906. In Tralee, which is served by a technology centre and an institute of technology, there has been no new inward investment since the launch of the spatial strategy and, it would appear, very little effort on the part of the State to interest foreign companies in the area. Not only that, while the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has refused to meet with representatives of Tralee Town Council to discuss <Col N="1589"/>ways of tackling the jobs crisis, she can find time to travel by helicopter to Sligo to open an off-licence.</P>
    <P>One area that is crucial to economic development is up-to-date communications technology. This is especially important in places outside the main urban centres where commerce can potentially outweigh other structural disadvantages. The White Paper noted this and referred to the prospect that the provision of broadband telecommunications might facilitate an expansion of this country&rsquo;s development in this sector, obviously with the view that rural areas would benefit from this. The paper also referred to the liberalisation of telecommunications in the State and suggested that greater competition would lead to a more rapid roll-out of broadband. However, a report from February of this year concludes that this has not been successful. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Ireland has a disappointingly under-developed broadband market. Low penetration is due to high wholesale costs, lack of competition, high retail prices, limited coverage in many non-urban areas, and general low market awareness.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Again, this proves that reliance on the private sector will not be sufficient to address such deficiencies.</P>
    <P>Another area to which the Minister referred was the difficulty of securing loans and the role that the credit unions can play where the banks are reluctant to lend to local community-based projects. This needs to be addressed, particularly when one considers how liberal the banks are in regard to certain other practises.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the way in which the co-operatives were transformed into PLCs. I agree that this came about when shareholders decided to sell but I would disagree as to the extent to which that decision was made in consideration of all the facts. I have experience of the foundation of Kerry Co-operative, in which <Col N="1590"/>my uncles and friends were involved as shareholders. I know that many who were actively engaged in farming found themselves heavily in debt and were compelled to sell their shares because of economic necessity and because they had been pressurised into modernising their holdings and buying expensive equipment.</P>
    <P>The growth of the large dairy and food processors has certainly not been of benefit to farmers. As well as decreasing the share of the value of farm produce that goes to farmers, it has altered the nature of rural communities. If we want to see the logical conclusion of that process we need only look to the situation in the United States, where the giant agri-business corporations control the entire food system and where farmers are increasingly becoming contract workers who produce to order. The sector is moving towards corporate farming, with profit before people. That is what the PLCs have done to rural Ireland, they have put profit before the people who set them up and the communities that supported them by giving them their start.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful and productive debate. For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to articulate our vision for rural Ireland, in which all of those who wish to live in rural communities are enabled to do so. That means working to preserve the family farms which are the bedrock of Irish agriculture, to ensure that fishing communities have the means to survive and that there are sufficient jobs in other sectors.</P>
    <P>It must also mean that rural communities are adequately served through the public services. Rural communities must be where it is attractive to live. Without that the urban centres will continue to swell to the detriment of urban dwellers themselves and to the balanced development of the rest of the country. At the same time we will face the prospect of townlands, villages and small towns that are slowly dying.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise the matter of why Shannon Development is not included in the central applications office website for the Government&rsquo;s proposed decentralisation plans.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Zone employs over 7,500 people and is one of the leading business parks in Ireland in terms of size, multi-sector nature and employment, and it is the core economic driver in the Shannon region. It is the home of 120 leading global companies with exports of more than &euro;2.5 billion in 2003, and contains the largest cluster of North American investment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the five years to the end of 2003, a total of 31 new industry start-ups were established on the Shannon Free Zone by Shannon Development, which accounted for 950 new jobs. Outside of the Shannon Free Zone, 12,500 people are employed by Shannon Development&rsquo;s Irish Enterprise clients.</P><Col N="1592"/>
    <P>The current uncertainly facing the mid-western region is caused by the Government&rsquo;s indecision regarding the future of Shannon Airport and the future of Shannon Development where the T&aacute;naiste has suggested that the responsibility of the Shannon Free Zone at Shannon Airport should be transferred to the proposed new Shannon Airport Authority. Does the T&aacute;naiste want the new airport authority to be property managers as well as running the airport?</P>
    <P>We all welcome decentralisation, but where does the future of Shannon Development lie? The Government has promised to move more than 10,000 civil and public servants from Dublin to 53 locations in 25 counties, which includes moving Enterprise Ireland to Shannon. One of the questions asked of a civil servant who wishes to apply for decentralisation on the Government&rsquo;s website <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i> is to choose a Department, office or agency to which to relocate. However, Shannon Development has been omitted from the website despite that decentralisation is meant to cover all agencies, commercial and non-commercial. Other agencies listed include &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission which is already decentralised.</P>
    <P>Is this part of a Government strategy not only to take the Shannon Free Zone operations from the agency, but to integrate the activities of Shannon Development with Enterprise Ireland? If this happens, job creation in the mid-west will suffer as an all-Ireland body takes this responsibility from the only true regional development agency in the west.</P><Col N="1593"/>
    <P>We all received correspondence from the T&aacute;naiste today regarding her future commitments to the Shannon region. While it is acknowledged that part of the function of Shannon Development will overlap with Enterprise Ireland, this is only part of the work the agency carries out. Its other functions include tourism and marketing, the technological parks and Shannon Free Zone, including overseas industry and the running of Shannon Heritage which employs more than 400 people during the peak season.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has been in charge of Shannon Development for the past seven years. During her many visits to the area, she has praised it for its commitment to attracting industry. Why now is she bringing out these proposals? Is not the real problem the future of Shannon Airport and how to finance the new airports authority, given the predictions in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that Shannon Airport will incur heavy losses if it becomes an independent airport?</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste should think again about Shannon Development. The agency has a proven track record over the last 45 years and can make a significant impact at regional level.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Breen for his contribution. The central applications facility, CAF, is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. The development of the CAF was one of the main recommendations of the decentralisation implementation group set up by the Government immediately after the announcement of the decentralisation programme by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement last December.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the CAF is to provide a means whereby public servants can apply to participate in the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme by selecting locations throughout the country to which they would choose to relocate. The facility was launched on 12 May 2004 and will remain open for the full duration of the decentralisation programme. Those public servants who lodge their applications before 8 July 2004 will, however, have priority over those who apply at a later stage in the programme.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the announcement of the programme, the Government sought to open discussions with the unions representing both civil servants and the staff of the various State agencies earmarked for relocation. One of the main issues, which was the subject of discussion with the unions, was the terms which would apply to applicants to the CAF. Apart from the Civil Service, staff of all the State agencies participating in the programme were included in the CAF. In addition, it was decided that staff in the remaining non-commercial State agencies not <Col N="1594"/>relocating under the programme would also be allowed to make applications through the facility.</P>
    <P>Since the list of participating agencies was prepared, a number of applications have been made to the Department of Finance for the inclusion of additional organisations. One category which has been looked at are those State agencies which are already located outside Dublin. There are a number of organisations, such as SFADCo, whose specific remit requires them to exist at a particular location. The position of these organisations and their suitability for inclusion in the CAF has been considered in detail and it has been decided to include SFADCo in the CAF.</P>
    <P>A discussion document was presented by the Department of Finance to the unions at an early stage in the engagement with the unions. This document formed the basis of the industrial relations discussions which preceded the launch of the CAF. We must remind ourselves that the overall objective of the decentralisation programme is to allow public servants the opportunity to relocate out of Dublin to various provincial locations. There are also knock-on benefits through the creation of career paths for staff outside Dublin while at the same time relieving pressure on infrastructure in the Dublin area. In addition, it was decided that as it was likely that staff already serving in provincial locations would seek, under the programme, to relocate to other provincial towns, these provincial locations would be included on the CAF.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that the decentralisation programme would be availed of by public servants to secure a transfer from one State organisation to another in the same location. This exclusion was included in the discussion document presented to the unions and now forms the basis on which the CAF operates. Since the inception of the decentralisation programme a number of years ago, the exclusion on the seeking of a transfer within the location in which an individual is employed has been continued. As I have outlined, the reasonable rationale for this exclusion is that the purpose of the programme is to facilitate the relocation of staff from the Dublin area to provincial locations, not to facilitate transfers within provincial locations.</P>

	<P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this important issue. While I welcome the Minister of State, I regret that the Minister for Education and Science is not present because the people in this school face a difficult situation. The Presentation secondary school in Milltown, County Kerry, at present caters for 452 pupils and 27 teachers. The numbers are set to increase substantially in September due mainly to an <Col N="1595"/>increase in population in the greater Milltown area.</P>
    <P>The number of new houses that have been built and are planned means that the population is growing rapidly. At present, staff and pupils are already in cramped conditions and are waiting for the go ahead for a school expansion, which has been delayed for many years. When I visited the school last week for a meeting with the principal and some members of staff in the staff room, such were the cramped conditions that there was only room for two chairs. This in a school with 27 teachers. The principal has no office; she shares with the secretary and when the parents wish to meet her, the secretary has to be asked to leave. This is not good practice in 2004.</P>
    <P>The school has only one science laboratory, which has not been modernised since it was built in 1982. This laboratory is shared by four science teachers. All the junior cycle students in the school take science and at senior level students are taking biology, chemistry, physics and agricultural science. The science laboratory needs to be upgraded as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, Milltown school requires three prefabs as a matter of urgency if it is to cater for the 110 new students next September. The Department has refused funding for these prefabs for the coming year and has even suggested that instead of providing this emergency accommodation the school should bus students to another secondary school to alleviate the overcrowding problem. I have never heard of such an outrageous solution to such an acute problem. Is this now the policy of the Department of Education and Science? If it is, it will set an appalling precedent for the future of our schools.</P>
    <P>The cost of these prefabs is approximately &euro;30,000, which is a pittance. Milltown secondary school is already paying in excess of &euro;35,000 for the rental of basic accommodation and to pay a teacher&rsquo;s salary. All this money is raised through voluntary fundraising. Is the Department of Education and Science now telling the board of management, the teachers and the parents that they are obliged to raise another &euro;30,000 before September to provide basic accommodation for the new students beginning secondary school? Has the Minister any understanding of the effort, time and energy that is required to raise this amount of money, particularly in such a short space of time, if the school is to have the accommodation in place for the beginning of September? By refusing Milltown Presentation secondary school this emergency accommodation, the Minister is saying that the school will have to raise over &euro;65,000 this year for the provision of accommodation and to pay the salary of a teacher. Where is the responsibility of the <Col N="1596"/>Department of Education and Science in this? It is outrageous.</P>
    <P>This is not just a problem in Milltown but also throughout the country. Young families are moving out into areas such as Milltown because they cannot afford to pay the exorbitant house prices in places such as Killarney. Unfortunately, however, the infrastructure is not keeping pace with the population growth and this is typical of what is happening all over this country. The only answer the Minister has for the parents and the pupils who plan to attend the Presentation secondary school in Milltown is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I do not have &euro;30,000 to provide emergency accommodation for your school. You will have to be bussed to another school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain who will make the decision about which pupils will be obliged to go to another school, a school they did not choose? Who will decide which school they will attend? This is all for the miserly sum of &euro;30,000. I am seeking a commitment from the Minister that he will supply the emergency accommodation required to provide the necessary classroom space for Milltown school next September. I also urge him to ensure the speedy commencement of the construction of the extension to the school.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy of the Department of Education and Science concerning capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding Presentation secondary school, Milltown, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Presentation secondary school, Milltown, is a co-educational secondary school with a current enrolment of 414 pupils. A large-scale building project comprising an extension of 1,542 sq. m. and refurbishment of the school is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme. This project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning &mdash; stage 4/5, detailed design/bill of quantities. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When publishing the 2004 school building programme, the Department outlined that its strategy for the future will be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officials from the Department are reviewing all projects, including the Presentation secondary school, Milltown, County Kerry, which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. The Department expects to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year.</P><Col N="1597"/>
    <P>The school authority recently submitted an application for temporary accommodation. All applications for temporary accommodation have been considered in the school planning section of the Department. In the context of available funding and the number of applications received for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. The application from Presentation secondary school was not successful on this occasion. The school&rsquo;s need for accommodation will be considered in the context of the aforementioned review.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The people of Mayo were shocked yesterday by the news that the orthopaedic unit in Mayo General Hospital will not now open on 1 July as promised. This unit has been promised for years. This all began ten years ago in 1994 when I was a candidate in a by-election. In 1997, when Fine Gael was in Government, we committed ourselves to this project and stated that this unit would become a reality. It is appalling to learn that now, ten years later, this facility has been built at major expense and which includes state-of-the-art operating theatres and a fully furnished ward, yet at the last minute it has been decided that it will not open.</P>
    <P>There is little point in having such a building standing there idle with no staff to run it. Interviews were held but no contracts were signed. I demand that the people selected at interview be given their contracts immediately and the unit open on 1 July as promised. The people of Mayo will no longer tolerate this. There is a long waiting list for orthopaedic services in Mayo and we refuse to accept that this unit will not open on 1 July. We have waited long enough for it.</P>
    <P>If there is a difficulty between the Western Health Board and the Department of Health and Children it must be rectified at once. I call on the Government to lift the embargo on the recruitment of nurses and other medical staff. A consultant surgeon has already been appointed for the unit and the remainder of the staff must be put in place immediately. The number of people an the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery is large. Some have waited months or even years to be put on the waiting list. No further delays will be tolerated. The people of Mayo demand that this unit open as scheduled.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;3.9 million has been spent on this project in 2003 and 2004 but no service has been provided. Clearly there is no shortage of finance. The problem results from bad management. Regardless of whether this is a management problem or a financial one, the people of Mayo refuse to let this happen. This unit must open immediately. A political commitment was given by the last Government and we want that commitment honoured. We are sick and tired of <Col N="1598"/>broken promises. The people of Mayo and the western region will not tolerate this any longer.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State has good news for me and the people of Mayo because if not, we will be out on the streets next week. We will be at the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when it opens in two weeks. We have had enough of broken promises from the Government and the Department of Health and Children. People are sick and in pain as they wait to be treated. A consultant has been dealing with people for the past few months on the basis that they will be operated on in July. Now there has been a row resulting in an embargo on staff recruitment.</P>
    <P>The Minister had better have good news for me because I have bad news for him and the members of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats. The people of Mayo will respond next week at the ballot box. We will highlight this problem and put pressure on the Department to sort out this difficulty immediately. It is a disgrace that I must raise this matter again tonight. We thought the unit would be officially opened before the elections but now something else has gone wrong. We will not accept this.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Health and Children, I am glad of this opportunity to discuss Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    <P>There has been unprecedented investment in services at Mayo General Hospital in recent years. The Government has invested heavily in the hospital&rsquo;s infrastructure. The second phase of a major development programme at the hospital began in 1998. The investment in this development, which was completed within the last year, was &euro;50 million. This development provided the necessary facilities for the development of orthopaedic services at the hospital, including ward accommodation and a state-of-the-art orthopaedic operating theatre to carry out surgery. The development also included a new accident and emergency department, a medical assessment unit, a geriatric assessment unit, an obstetric and delivery suite, CT scanning facilities, a new helicopter landing facility, an improved mortuary and post-mortem room, a new information technology system and a new administration and medical records department.</P>
    <P>Some facts will underline the Government&rsquo;s record in developing hospital services for the people of Mayo.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to know about the orthopaedic unit. We do not want to hear a political broadcast.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Annual funding for Mayo General Hospital is now more than &euro;50 million. The Government has increased expenditure at the hospital by &euro;30 million since 1997. The hospital now employs about 830 whole-time equivalent staff. This represents an increase in staffing levels at the hospital of more than 300 <Col N="1599"/>wholetime equivalent staff in the past seven years. These extra staff are providing additional and improved hospital services to the people of Mayo. Activity at the hospital has increased each year. Compared to 1997, the hospital has increased its number of in-patients by more than 3,000 and has nearly trebled the number of patients it treats as day cases. More than 22,000 in-patients and day cases were treated in 2003. A total of 27,000 people attended the casualty department in 2003. The hospital&rsquo;s out-patient department now treats more than 33,000 people. There has been an increase in the number of beds at the hospital over recent years. The number of beds at the hospital when the orthopaedic service opens will be more than 300.</P>
    <P>The new 33-bed orthopaedic unit will be a particularly valuable addition to the hospital and of great benefit to the people of County Mayo. Funding of &euro;3.9 million has already been provided to the Western Health Board to allow for the opening of the new orthopaedic service. One consultant orthopaedic surgeon has been recruited by the Western Health Board. This person took up duty on 1 February. The Western Health Board has informed me that discussions <Col N="1600"/>among the orthopaedic staff in Galway and Mayo are continuing in an effort to configure the best use of both counties&rsquo; facilities. These discussions are taking place within a framework for developing an overall integrated strategic and operational policy for orthopaedic services in the region.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, substantial funding has already been provided to commission orthopaedic services in Mayo.</P>

The Minister is committed to ensuring that the new orthopaedic services are established at Mayo General Hospital at the earliest possible date.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently announced my intention to advance a modernisation and change agenda for the local government fire, rescue and emergency services. The objective, which takes account of the conclusions and recommendations of the report of the review of fire safety and fire services, is to deliver a safer society through reducing death and injury, damage to property, and other social and economic costs arising from fire and other emergencies.</P>
    <P>As a key element of this agenda, I have indicated my wish to bring firm proposals to Government to seek the establishment of a national fire services authority to develop and manage a new modernised fire and rescue service. This authority would be the overarching body for fire services in Ireland. I have made it clear that to deliver this national authority, the Government will need to see positive and verifiable commitment and progress by all stakeholders in delivering change.</P>
    <P>I had a constructive meeting with a number of key fire service stakeholders on 10 May 2004 to elaborate on my proposals for the future direction of the fire service and to indicate what action is needed from all parties to deliver this modernisation and change programme. An initial position paper for delivery of this agenda has issued for stakeholder views and I have arranged a further meeting for 17 June next to continue this engagement with stakeholders.</P>
    <P>I intend, as an interim, step to mandate the Fire Services Council to become the lead agency to co-ordinate this change process pending the establishment of a national authority. The functions of the council will be expanded using existing statutory powers as recommended in the review report, with the option of primary legislation to be considered in the medium to longer term future when the new regime is sufficiently developed.</P>
    <P>New staff will be appointed to the Fire Services Council to co-ordinate and drive an expanded <Col N="1602"/>work programme. This will also include secondments from the local government sector to enhance the technical support available as well as consultancy expertise as required.</P>
    <P>Continuing major capital investment in the fire service, including the allocation of &euro;19 million this year and approval to a further 13 new fire stations and 23 additional appliances announced last week, is an indication of my commitment to the service; the improved infrastructure being provided will also support the delivery of this change agenda.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 39 together.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office, I have assigned high priority to securing better enforcement of the waste code. There can be no excuse for illegal waste activities, irrespective of whether they take the form of illegal dumping within the State or the illegal exportation of waste to another jurisdiction. While I am not in a position to comment on individual cases of suggested illegal waste dumping activities in this jurisdiction, I wish to outline to the House details of a number of important initiatives I have taken in relation to enforcement generally.</P>
    <P>First, I took the opportunity of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 to provide new enforcement powers and to increase the maximum fines for contraventions of the waste code. Conviction on indictment for an offence under the Waste Management Acts now carries a maximum fine of &euro;15 million, as well as a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.</P>
    <P>Second, I have recognised the need for improved structural arrangements to underpin the enforcement effort. I announced last October the establishment of a new Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, located within the Environmental Protection Agency. While it has a wide remit, the OEE, at my request, is focusing on waste-related enforcement activities in its early stages and is already operational in this area. In particular, the OEE is about to initiate a comprehensive study to try better to quantify the scale of illegal activities and <Col N="1603"/>I have made a commitment to introduce further enforcement initiatives that may be necessary on foot of the outcome of this study.</P>
    <P>Third, I have acknowledged the importance of providing additional resources to underpin the waste enforcement effort. In that regard, I have allocated &euro;7 million from the environment fund to support the first year of a major five year programme of local authority waste enforcement activities. The aim is to provide a stronger and more visible local authority enforcement presence on the ground and to ensure more frequent inspections and speedier responses to reported instances of illegal dumping.</P>
    <P>As regards reported incidences of illegal cross-Border dumping in Northern Ireland, I discussed this issue at some length at a meeting less than two months ago with my counterpart at the Northern Ireland Office, Ms Angela Smith, MP. On foot of these discussions, a high level meeting was held on 21 May 2004, involving representatives from my Department and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, as well as from local authorities North and South, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the respective customs services. At this meeting, useful discussions took place, particularly in relation to the scope for securing better inter-agency co-operation on enforcement. I am confident that this engagement, which will continue on an ongoing basis, will yield more effective enforcement operations in the short term.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the relevant authorities in this jurisdiction will continue to co-operate actively with the authorities in Northern Ireland with a view to dealing effectively with the illegal cross-Border waste movements issue.</P>

     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the latest information available to his Department on the progress made with the vitrification of the highly active liquid waste stored at the Sellafield complex; when it is estimated that the process will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The vitrification plant at Sellafield, which came into operation in 1991 with two vitrification lines, encapsulates the liquid high level radioactive waste held in storage tanks at Sellafield into glass blocks. This is a more stable form for storage and reduces the risk of leakages and subsequent radioactive contamination of the environment.</P>
    <P>Given the technical problems with the vitrification plant, throughput performance has been well below that expected. A third vitrification line, aimed at increasing vitrification capacity, is currently at the final stages of commissioning and is scheduled to commence operations by the end of June 2004.</P>
    <P>In January 2001, BNFL was directed by the UK Health and Safety Executive&rsquo;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to reduce, by way of vitrification, the amount of liquid waste in the storage tanks to a small buffer stock volume by July 2015. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has been advised by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate that despite the ongoing problems with the existing vitrification lines, the July 2015 target date is achievable. The RPII has asked the NII to keep the RPII regularly updated on progress in relation to vitrification.</P>
    <P>The RPII and the Government are concerned about the continuing storage of this highly active waste in liquid form in tanks at Sellafield and have been pressing, and will continue to press, the UK authorities to accelerate the rate of <Col N="1605"/>vitrification. This liquid waste arises from the reprocessing operations at Sellafield. As such, the need for vitrification will ultimately cease when the production of the liquid waste also ceases. The Government will, therefore, continue to use available avenues, both diplomatic and legal, to bring about an end to reprocessing operations at Sellafield.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2003 place a general duty of care on the holders of waste to ensure that it is disposed of in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution. In addition, under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises or land is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The enforcement of waste and air pollution legislation is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority and my Department has no direct function in the matter. However, as part of the Race Against Waste campaign, I am considering ways in which better awareness about the issues surrounding the uncontrolled burning of waste can be created.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the increasing replacement of paper packaging with plastic in the agricultural sector, particularly in the areas of animal feed and vegetable packaging. Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging that satisfies the provisions of the directive, that is, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in annex II of the directive as to the composition and reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, measures are required to ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and/or collection of used packaging, and for the reuse or recovery, including recycling, of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting the packaging waste recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in Directive 94/62/EC. Producer responsibility initiatives already operate in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, that is, Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Film Producers&rsquo; group in the case of farm plastics, for example, silage bale wrap and sheeting. In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question.</P><Col N="1606"/>
    <P>I am anxious to build on the success of the farm plastics scheme and my Department will, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, look at ways in which recovery and recycling in this sector can be further developed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The affordable housing initiative under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement is designed to meet the needs of persons currently priced out of the housing market. In response, the Government has committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing through this initiative and the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made on this initiative. First, the identification of sites for the initiative last July and December has been a critical step in ensuring early mobilisation of affordable housing for the initiative. There are now 24 individual projects on the lands identified to date for the initiative. Together with affordable housing coming through Part V arrangements, the sites so far identified have the potential to deliver 6,100 housing units. The fact that these sites are being released by both local authorities and a range of other State authorities indicates the broad commitment at Government level to <Col N="1607"/>facilitate the earliest delivery of housing at affordable prices.</P>
    <P>Second, working with the parties to the pay agreement we have developed a delivery model which builds upon the existing expertise of local authorities, while at the same time ensuring that there is no impact on general Government finances, as this is one of the parameters set by the agreement. The housing will, therefore, be delivered through arrangements between local authorities and the private sector. Third, we have agreed, in principle, eligibility criteria with the parties to the pay agreement subject to further discussions on the detail.</P>
    <P>The first affordable housing initiative project on State or local authority lands commenced in April on the site in Finglas Road and will deliver 150 plus affordable residential units. The timescale for delivery and the precise number of units to be delivered on each of the other sites is being determined in planning the projects. There are 24 projects involved, and they vary in terms of key site characteristics such as zoning status and servicing. Allowance must also be factored in for the procurement of specific developers to deliver the projects through competitive tendering and for obtaining planning permission. These processes, while involving a time element, are necessary to ensure the effective delivery of housing and the creation of housing in good quality environments. We will parallel activities as necessary to ensure early delivery of units.</P>
    <P>The contact group on the affordable housing initiative, which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and comprises representatives of my Department and the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office plays an important role in ensuring the effective implementation of the initiative. Its work includes overseeing the effective and early implementation of the projects already identified, addressing any policy issues arising in implementing the initiative within the parameters of the agreement and continuing with the process of identifying State lands for use in the initiative. The services of Mr. Des Geraghty, former President of SIPTU, have also been engaged to assist with the initiative. Furthermore, an implementation team within my own Department and project managers at local level are all working to ensure the success of the initiative.</P>
    <P>Considerable work has been done to date on the initiative, the fruits of which will emerge during this year and into the future as projects are brought to the market, and further work on implementing the initiative is progressing as a priority. This is firm evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to making measurable progress in the implementation of the initiative. We will also work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised while ensuring the continuation of measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 33 and 60 together.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that the measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for house completions, with 68,819 units completed, an increase in output of 19.3% on 2002 and an increase of 10.5% in output in the greater Dublin area during the same period. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe &mdash; 17 houses per 1,000 population, which is an outstanding achievement. The investment in the servicing of land has led to a strong stock of land available for residential development.</P>
    <P>While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably <Col N="1609"/>since the late 1990&rsquo;s when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. Detailed information on house prices are set out in my Department&rsquo;s housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, are now predicting greater balance in the housing market over the next few years, as increased supply has a dampening effect on house prices. Indicative data available to the Department shows that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market. The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply, and the prospects for another good year in the housing sector are positive, as trends in house completions have continued to increase in the early part of this year.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met. Almost &euro;5.32 billion was spent in the first four years of the NDP on social and affordable housing measures, which is more than 10% ahead of the forecast for the period, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to continue to meet the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs. The year 2003 had the highest level of housing provision under the full range of social and affordable housing measures for over 15 years, the needs of over 13,600 households were met compared to almost 8,500 in 1998, ensuring that the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs are addressed. </P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner and we will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary.</P>

	<P>Member states were required to transpose the provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, into national legislation by 21 April 2002, that is, within 18 months after the adoption of the directive on 21 October 2000. My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the <Col N="1611"/>Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other stakeholders since before the adoption of the directive with regard to the effective implementation of the directive.</P>
    <P>The delay in transposing and implementing the directive is primarily due to difficulties encountered in reaching agreement with the relevant sectors on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take back arrangements required by the directive, including how such arrangements will be funded.</P>
    <P>The legal proceedings initiated by the European Commission against Ireland in this matter relate to partial transposition into national legislation and non-implementation of the directive provisions. In this regard, enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the directive were incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003.

     <Quest>if he intends to provide funding for the radon remediation grant scheme in view of the threat to householders identified in the recent survey of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which found some of the highest concentrations of radon gas ever found in a number of houses surveyed in Castleisland, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 40 together.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated, it would not be practicable in current budgetary circumstances to provide Exchequer funding for a radon remediation grant scheme in respect of domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>Following the identification in July 2003 of a house in Castleisland with radon concentration levels of approximately 49,000 Bq/m3, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, undertook a survey of houses in the area. This involved the RPII writing to 2,500 householders in the four national grid squares adjacent to the town of Castleisland advising them to have radon measurements carried out in their homes. Of those, 413 householders, 16%, requested measurements and results, now available for 377 of these, indicated that 52,<?oasys _jy?>14%, have radon concentrations above the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3. Six had <Col N="1612"/>concentrations above 1,000 Bq/m3. Radon measurements were also completed in respect of 90 local authority homes in Castleisland, none of which were found to have radon concentrations in excess of the national reference level. While some houses have high radon concentration levels, the majority, over 90%, of houses nationwide would have radon concentrations below the national reference level.</P>
    <P>The RPII has always advised householders, particularly those living in high radon areas, to have their homes measured for radon, and where necessary has also advised householders to have remediation works carried out. Over the years, the Government, through the RPII, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. During the years 1992 to 1999, the RPII carried out a national survey of radon in domestic dwellings aimed at assessing the extent of the radon problem in homes. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12 month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km by 10 km grid square throughout the country. The RPII&rsquo;s website contains a comprehensive map of the high radon areas in Ireland as well as the report of its national survey of radon in homes.</P>
    <P>Upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997, require all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. In February 2002, my Department published a booklet entitled, Radon in Existing Buildings &mdash; Corrective Options, advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3.</P>
    <P>In recent months, the RPII has undertaken several initiatives to further heighten awareness of the radon issue in Ireland. Both the institute and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the reference level to undertake remediation works.</P>

In accordance with the report&rsquo;s recommendations, the Department of Finance has developed an integrated transfer system or central applications facility which allows eligible people in my Department and its agencies to apply for transfer to decentralised locations and rank their preferences for different locations. This system will enable me to determine interest in transferring to the designated locations.</P>
    <P>An implementation plan, covering all aspects of the decentralisation process for my Department has been submitted to the decentralisation implementation group. The plan, in particular, incorporates specific risk assessment and mitigation strategies. I will be happy to arrange for the publication of the implementation plan as soon as possible after it has been made available to staff interests. I understand that an implementation plan has also been submitted by the National Building Agency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of public financial procedures generally, my Department is fully aware of the requirement in the public financial procedures for accounting officers to ensure that all relevant financial considerations are taken fully into account, in relation to the preparation and implementation of policy proposals relating to expenditure or income. In addition, there is an ongoing awareness in my Department of the type of risks identified in paragraph 6.31 of the report of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers &mdash; the Mullarkey Report. I can confirm that these issues are regularly addressed in my Department.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The inventory of dioxin and furan emissions to air, land and water in Ireland for 2000 and 2010 published by the EPA in December 2002, provides a useful indication of the relative significance of various emission sources for dioxins.</P>
    <P>In relation to the nine hazardous waste incinerators in operation in Ireland in the year 2000, the report estimated these to have contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air &mdash; tables 1 and 4.2 of the report refer. Even assuming that 1 million tonnes of municipal waste might be managed by way of incineration in 2010, the report projects that dioxin emissions from waste incineration would account for less than 2% of total dioxin emissions to air at that time.</P>
    <P>National and EU policy both recognise that thermal treatment, with energy recovery, licensed to the highest environmental standards, has a role to play as one element within the integrated approach to waste management, based on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy. The operation of such facilities in Ireland is subject to rigorous licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2003, taking account of the requirements of the EU Incineration Directive which has been transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>In addition, I draw attention to the report on the Review of Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management: Municipal Solid Waste and Similar Wastes, which was published recently by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The study, <i>inter alia</i>, looked at cancer, respiratory diseases and birth defects and found no evidence for a link between the incidence of the diseases and the current generation of incinerators.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 30 together.</P>
    <P>I refer to the replies to Question No. 388 of 25 May 2004 and to Question No. 371 of 1 June 2004. The Government&rsquo;s objective is to secure the optimal and least cost arrangements for compliance with the nitrates directive, thus protecting the interests both of the environment and of those Irish farmers whose activities would be affected.</P>
    <P>To that end, the draft action programme, which was issued for public consultation jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food last December, is intended to meet the requirements of the directive, as clarified by recent European Court judgments, including the requirement of a general land spreading limit of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. The submission of the action programme to the European Commission will also allow the Government to seek approval from the Commission for higher land spreading limits, up to 250 kg, in appropriate circumstances. This approach is in the best interests of Irish agriculture, as continued non-compliance with the directive would compromise EU funding for farm support measures. In finalising the action programme, regard is being had to the <Col N="1617"/>submissions received and further consultation with the farming bodies will take place.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture generates some 57 million tonnes per annum of organic waste, or 76% of all waste, and there is a strong scientific consensus that this is a major source of inland water pollution in Ireland. This is reflected in research and surveys by the EPA and other bodies, such as Teagasc, over a long period of time and by detailed research carried out in particular areas in the context of catchment-based water management projects, for example, the Derg-Ree project. The conclusion is also consistent with the findings of similar studies in other countries.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 52 together.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for ensuring that water quality is protected against pollution from septic tanks lies with the operator of the tank. A person who causes or permits polluting matter to enter waters, directly or indirectly, commits an offence under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and, in addition to such penalties as may be applied by a court, can he held responsible for any necessary remedial measures. The Water Services Bill 2003, which is currently before the Seanad, will place a general duty of care on owners-occupiers to ensure that septic tanks and other treatment systems serving their premises are kept so as not to cause a nuisance, or a risk to human health or the environment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, acting under the general supervision of the EPA, have a wide range of powers and duties to protect water quality. Discharges from septic tanks serving large-scale or commercial premises are subject to licensing under the Acts. Small scale discharges via a percolation area from septic tanks serving domestic dwellings are exempt from licensing but are subject to the general enforcement powers available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department issues guidance and standards from time to time in relation to on-site waste water treatment systems and seeks to ensure the use of an appropriate system in each case. Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with part H, drainage and wastewater disposal, of the national building regulations. The relevant technical guidance document, TGD H, calls up Irish standard recommendation SR 6: 1991 for septic tanks serving single houses, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI. A manual on wastewater systems serving single houses is being developed by the EPA and I intend that the manual will supersede SR6: 1991 as soon as it is published.</P>
    <P>Guidelines prepared jointly by my Department, the EPA and Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes were issued to local authorities in May 1999. These schemes are intended to provide a framework for decision-making by statutory authorities in relation to activities which might give rise to a risk of polluting ground waters In a circular letter of 31 July 2003 on groundwater protection and the planning system, my Department directed the attention of local authorities to the need for more information within development plans on the location and potential vulnerability of groundwater resources and for clear policies on how development in different areas will be approached based on the available information. Local authorities were also requested to ensure that effective regimes for the proper assessment of site conditions as well as the design, <Col N="1619"/>installation and maintenance of on-site wastewater treatment and disposal facilities are put in place, as well as appropriate monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that ensure that those who carry out approved development meet the obligations to adhere to the terms of planning permissions.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce grants for the upgrading of septic tanks. The national rural monitoring committee is currently overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small-scale waste water collection and treatment systems. Some 12 villages in six counties have been selected as locations for the pilot programme under which appointed contractors will design, build and operate the infrastructure over a 20 year period. Construction is expected to commence later this year. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the national rural water monitoring committee envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside of the immediate catchment of such treatment systems. Confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of related grants must await the outcome of the pilot programme.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 45 and 73 together.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 372 of 1 June 2004. All monitoring data, including that highlighted in the EPA&rsquo;s recent report Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2004, indicates that Irish ambient air quality is good and with the exception of the unrepresentative College Street site in Dublin, no <Col N="1620"/>EU or national standards are being breached. However, as highlighted in the report, it is evident that emissions from road traffic pose the main challenge to the maintenance and improvement of this situation.</P>
    <P>A number of policies and measures have been, and continue to be, undertaken on an ongoing basis to reduce traffic-sourced air pollution both within policy areas under my remit, and areas which are the responsibility of other Ministers, most notably the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>Within my remit the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 place primary responsibility for the development of air quality management plans on the relevant local authorities in co-operation with the Environmental Protection Agency. Local authorities also have responsibility to prepare short term air pollution action plans where the EPA considers measures are likely to be needed in the short term where there is a risk of air pollution problems, including from traffic sources. The launch of a new EPA website in January 2004 with up to date publicly accessible data from a number of monitoring stations nationally now allows the public to gauge air quality in relation to current EU and national standards on a real time basis.</P>
    <P>Under the EU auto oil programme a series of directives has been implemented which provide for progressively cleaner road fuels, including introduction next year of an element of totally sulphur free fuels ahead of a mandatory EU requirement from 2009. As well as sulphur reduction in both petrol and diesel, benzene, aromatic and olefin levels in petrol have already been significantly reduced, and aromatics will be further reduced again from next year.</P>
    <P>Regulations are in place since 2001 requiring the mandatory provision of consumer information on fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions from all new passenger cars. This measure allows consumers to make informed choices in vehicle purchasing on both environmental and fuel efficiency grounds.</P>
    <P>Each year since 2000 my Department, the Department of Transport, Sustainable Energy Ireland and participating local authorities have promoted the benefits of alternative transport modes and increased public transport usage through our support of European car free day. Participation by Irish local authorities has been encouraging, rising from an initial five participants in 2000 to 14 participants in 2003. The event takes place annually on 22 September and this year the focus will be on enhancing commuter mobility and deepening the involvement of schools, based, <i>inter alia</i>, on alternatives to the car for the school run.</P>
    <P>Finally, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU a first reading agreement was reached between the Council of Environment Ministers and the European Parliament on a proposal for a directive relating to arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons, PAHs, in <Col N="1621"/>ambient air. PAHs are sourced, <i>inter alia</i>, from traffic pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport is responsible for measures in relation to vehicle standards, reductions in traffic congestion, roads improvements including by-passes, the Dublin Port tunnel, the M50 completion, Luas, rail, DART and bus upgrades and demand management measures all of which potentially contribute to emissions reductions from vehicle traffic in the transport section.</P>

The Government, primarily through my Department, is working within the EU, and representing the EU position externally through the Troika system, to ensure the Kyoto Protocol enters into force at the earliest possible date. The EU continues to engage with the US on a range of climate change issues despite its decision not to ratify the protocol.</P>
    <P>I met the US delegation during the preparations for last December&rsquo;s conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change, and discussed the need for progress in relation to the Kyoto Protocol. In my position as the chairman of the OECD meeting in Paris of Environment Ministers in April 2004, at which the US participated, my conclusions noted that Ministers participating in the discussions on the climate change part of the agenda stressed the need for sufficient ratifications to ensure the entry into force of the protocol, the importance that signatories move <Col N="1622"/>ahead to meet their Kyoto commitments, and the need to look ahead to post-Kyoto actions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 273 together.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recent address by the president of the Irish Planning Institute. I value and welcome the views of all stakeholders in the planning process. I consider that much has been done in recent years to strengthen and renew spatial planning in Ireland. Comprehensive new planning legislation has been developed and is being implemented; a national spatial strategy has been formulated and is being rolled out, and numerous policy guidance notes and directions have been issued by my Department in contrast to the absence of such central input to the planning process until the late 1990s.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the national spatial strategy, NSS, and has put a wide range of measures in place at national, regional and local levels aimed at achieving the strategy&rsquo;s objectives. A significant milestone in the implementation of the strategy was reached recently with the adoption by all regional authorities of regional planning guidelines which will help to structure and inform more local planning. For the first time guidelines <Col N="1623"/>of this nature have now been put in place throughout the whole country setting the strategic policy agenda which planning authorities must address in their development plans and creating the crucial linkage needed between overall national spatial policy as set out under the NSS and local planning policies.</P>
    <P>In adopting and publishing the NSS the Government stated that it would take full account of the strategy in moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. The decentralisation programme takes account of the NSS. However, the Government also had to take account of a wide range of other factors in selecting suitable locations for decentralisation. These other factors included the core business and nature of the relevant Department or agency, the location of their customer base, the location of existing decentralised offices, the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region, the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the new jobs involved, the existence of good transport links and the general infrastructure capacity in the locations selected.</P>
    <P>In addition to gateways and hubs the NSS identified, the need to strengthen the county town and large town structure and the need for a renewed emphasis on the potential of small towns, villages and rural areas. The strategy envisages that county towns and other medium-sized towns would continue to play important roles as local capitals, developing their enterprise and service functions and continuing to provide opportunities for employment both in the towns themselves, and in related smaller towns, villages and rural areas. The relocation of public service employment to many of these towns will help to underpin the important role which many of them will continue to play into the future.</P>
    <P>Other recent developments of note supporting the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objectives as set out under the NSS have included the substantial progress now being made on major national development plan capital investment programmes supporting balanced regional development, particularly in areas such as the development of key regional and inter-regional road and rail linkages and substantial infrastructure projects which will support the role the key gateways and hubs identified in the strategy. The recently completed mid-term review of the national development plan also signals strongly the potential for further aligning NDP expenditure with the NSS planning framework, particularly in the environmental infrastructure and regional operational programmes.</P>
    <P>Gateway implementation frameworks are now in place in Cork and Galway and work on similar is advancing in other areas. The proposals announced recently for substantial investment in new suburban rail services in the Cork area <Col N="1624"/>provide a significant example of a direct response from the Government to the planning policies which have been put in place by the Cork County and City Councils, creating the conditions for accelerating the development of Cork as a key regional city and gateway in the south west.</P>

	<P>It is not anticipated that development contributions adopted under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which are levied to fund the provision of local authority infrastructure that benefits development, will unduly affect the price of houses. While the development contribution system was reformed in the 2000 Act, it is continuous with the levying of contributions by local authorities which has operated since the commencement of the 1963 Act. In addition, a circular letter issued on 27 June 2003 advised planning authorities that while it is envisaged that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, the local authority should take care to avoid development contributions that are excessively high.</P>

	<P>Progress in the implementation of the infrastructure programmes under the national development plan for which my Department has responsibility continues to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>At the end of 2003, cumulative expenditure on water services was running at 98.6% of target and a total of 276 schemes had been completed. While short of the mid-term target in terms of the number of projects completed, some of the projects completed, such as the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant in Dublin, were large in terms of scale, their impact on the environment and their role in the achievement of the objectives of the national development plan. Arising from the mid-term review of the national development plan, work is currently underway in my Department to devise a broader range of indicators that will better reflect the progress being achieved at measure level. The water services investment programme 2004 to 2006, which I announced on 7 May, contains 869 water and sewerage schemes at various stages of development and underlines my continued commitment to water and wastewater infrastructure provision.</P>
    <P>My Department is also reviewing the NDP programme complement for housing to take account of the recommendations of the mid-term review and the multi-annual funding envelopes. Cumulative expenditure to end-2003 on this measure to date is 10% ahead of target at just under &euro;5.32 billion. Despite significant progress in terms of output it has not been possible to achieve some mid-term targets due to higher than anticipated construction costs. The Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce five year multi-annual capital investment programmes provides an important opportunity to ensure a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    <P>Cumulative expenditure on the non-national roads measure, at almost &euro;1.62 billion to the end of 2003, is 14.29% ahead of target. Output under this measure is also ahead of target, demonstrating that the objectives of this measure are being met. To the end of 2003, for instance, over 17,000 km of non-national roads were improved under this measure. This is 24% ahead of the mid-term target. This rate of improvement to the non-national road network will contribute to the measure&rsquo;s aim of supporting the economic and social development of the regions.</P>
    <P>The rural water measure provides funding for investment in water treatment, disinfection and distribution equipment for group water schemes to ensure that they can provide an adequate supply of water within their catchment area which meets the requirements of the EU directive on drinking water quality. Cumulative expenditure to end 2003 on this measure, at &euro;227.03 million, is at 66% of target. Over 200,000 people have benefited from new or improved rural water schemes and percentage compliance with the <Col N="1626"/>drinking water regulations, at 80.9%, exceeds the mid-term target of 75%.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the waste management measure is behind target with no expenditure having taken place in the first two years of the national development plan, due to the delays which took place in the adoption of waste management plans by local authorities. However, the rate of expenditure has increased significantly, reflecting major progress in delivering modern waste infrastructure facilities. In April, I announced the third tranche of grants for local authority recycling and recovery facilities, amounting to &euro;25 million. This tranche of grants, together with the &euro;22 million I have previously allocated, will represent considerable progress in the implementation of this measure.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of 2003, a total of &euro;50.196 million had been spent on the urban and village renewal measure, the aim of which is to provide financial support for a range of interventions to upgrade cities, towns and villages to make them more attractive places in which to live and work. The measure also seeks to encourage social and economic development and to facilitate and support the development of tourism and tourism-related activity. While expenditure is at roughly 60% of target, some 470 projects have been completed, representing 96% of the mid-term target.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under the habitats protection and conservation measure has not reached the mid-term target and output under the measure has been behind target. Progress on the development of two visitor centres has been slower than anticipated. It is hoped, however, that both centres will be completed by the end of the NDP period. As a means of implementing the 1992 EU habitats directive, funding is provided for conservation purposes by way of the acquisition of designated lands and compensation to landowners who forego income as a result of designation. It is difficult to forecast the level of expenditure associated with these acquisition and compensation payments, so the relevance of specific targets is undermined. My Department is currently working on revised indicators that will better reflect the progress being made on this measure.</P>
    <P>Revised indicators are also being considered for the heritage conservation measure where cumulative expenditure to end 2003 is at 65% of target. However the number of heritage sites improved during that period exceeds the mid-term target of 36 sites by one. In terms of visitor numbers, 2.4 million people visited heritage sites in 2003. This exceeded the mid-term target of 2.22 million visitors by 180,000 people.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my Department is making good progress in meeting the targets associated with most of the measures under the national development plan which are being implemented by my Department. Where progress on some measures was slow at the outset, it is encouraging to note that, by 2003, expenditure was <Col N="1627"/>approaching target and the effect of this expenditure was being felt by way of increased outputs. Where output indicators are being revised in the context of the mid-term review of the national development plan, it is with a view to the revised indicators providing better quality information as to the achievement of objectives under the national development plan.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 62 together.</P>
    <P>The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, compared with 39,176 households in March 1999. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department&rsquo;s September 2002 quarterly edition of the housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. There is no evidence to indicate that the numbers of households on the housing lists have risen to 60,000. The next statutory assessment of housing need is due to take place in March 2005.</P>
    <P>Local authorities completed-acquired 5,074 units in 2002, 4,972 units in 2003 and at this stage it is estimated completions-acquisitions will be approximately at the same level in 2004. In addition, the voluntary housing sector provided 1,360 units in 2002, 1,617 units in 2003 and is expected to provide 1,800 units in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and have responded actively to this situation by expanding social and affordable housing output. For example, it is anticipated that total social housing output this year taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing <Col N="1628"/>measures will meet the needs of around 13,000 households. This compares with some 7,000 households in 1993.</P>
    <P>The affordable and shared ownership schemes benefit low income house purchasers and those households having difficulties securing loans from financial institutions. Last year 1,524 affordable housing units were built while almost 1,000 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme. Output under both schemes, at this stage, will be approximately at the same level in 2004.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>During its Presidency of the European Union, Ireland actively sought to progress towards the adoption of these two directives, together known as the nuclear safety package. In chairing the European Council&rsquo;s atomic questions working group, Ireland sought to find a sound consensus on the package to facilitate its adoption at the earliest opportunity. While a number of member states, including Ireland, favoured the adoption of EU directives, a blocking minority opposed the principle of a legal instrument. Despite intensive efforts on the part of the Presidency to find unanimous agreement in the group for the adoption of the package in the form of directives, the group was unable to reach a consensus in that regard.</P>
    <P>Following its consideration of the matter on 13 May 2004, Coreper mandated the atomic questions working group to develop Council conclusions in regard to the package and to report back to Coreper before the end of June. This process is now in train.</P>

	<P>I am aware of recent media reports regarding an, as yet, unpublished report by the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology which I understand includes references to potential impacts of aircraft on UK nuclear reactors. This report when published will be considered by my officials with the assistance of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII.</P>
    <P>The latest reports follow a series of media reports in late March on security matters at Sellafield, including references to alleged breaches of the no fly zone around Sellafield by military aircraft, the relative vulnerabilities to aircraft attack of the Sellafield nuclear plant and the provision of additional physical security measures at Sellafield. On foot of these latter reports, I have written to The Rt. Hon. Ms Patricia Hewitt, MP, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, seeking a report on the various issues raised and I am awaiting a reply.</P>
    <P>The safety of Sellafield, and the protective measures in place to secure this, are a particular ongoing concern in Ireland, and are the subject of regular discussions at both ministerial and official level between the UK and Ireland. They have <Col N="1630"/>also been addressed in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s case concerning the Sellafield MOX plant under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. However, the response by the UK, that access to security sensitive information is restricted to those who have an operational need for such information, severely restricts the potential for providing the necessary reassurances to the Irish public in relation to our legitimate concerns regarding the significant risks posed by an accident or malicious attack at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>On this basis, there is a clear need for an agreed, structured and meaningful exchange of sensitive security information which will meet the confidence building and assurance needs of Ireland in relation to safety and security at Sellafield without compromising the security needs and concerns of the UK in relation to such information. As long as Sellafield poses a threat to the health and environment of Irish people, I will continue to ensure that these concerns are reflected in our ongoing contacts at ministerial and official level on nuclear issues.</P>

	<P>Directive 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001, commonly known as the SEA directive, requires,<i> inter alia</i>, that an environmental assessment be carried out of all land use plans which are likely to have significant effects on the environment. This requirement applies to plans whose preparation begins after 21 July 2004. In terms of land use planning, the directive will be given effect in Ireland through a mandatory requirement for SEA in the case of: regional planning guidelines; city and county development plans; development plans prepared by town councils where the population involved is 10,000 or more; local area plans where the population involved is 10,000 or more, and planning schemes in respect of strategic development zones.</P>
    <P>Screening of the need for SEA will apply to: development plans prepared by town councils where the population involved is less than 10,000; local area plans where the population involved is less than 10,000, and variations to development plans.</P>
    <P>On 8 March 2004, I issued, for public consultation, draft guidelines for regional and planning authorities on implementation of the directive. A copy of the draft guidelines has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. I am currently examining 25 submissions which were received in response to the public consultation process and I hope to publish the guidelines shortly. The regulations to give effect to the planning provisions of the SEA directive are being prepared in my Department at present and I plan to sign them in advance of 21 July 2004.</P>

     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent annual report of the Dublin Simon Community which found that the number of families and children experiencing homelessness had increased significantly since 1999; the steps that are being taken to deal with this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the recent comments of the Dublin Simon Community on the number of homeless persons and households identified in the assessments of housing need undertaken by local authorities in 1999 and 2002. Full details of the outcome of the assessments were also published in my Department&rsquo;s housing statistics bulletins in 1999 and 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to tackling the issue of homelessness in a sustained and vigorous manner. Since the launch of the integrated and preventative strategies on homelessness in 2000 and 2002, respectively, there has been considerable and sustained progress in the provision of a wide range of accommodation facilities and services to meet the specific needs of homeless households. In spite of demands from other social housing areas, the funding for accommodation and related services for homeless persons has increased again this year. The total of &euro;51 million available this year brings to &euro;190.6 million the total provided for this purpose since 2000.</P>
    <P>A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation has been provided. This has enabled rough sleepers to access emergency accommodation and allowed homeless persons to move out of emergency accommodation and into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities together with specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough, as well as of homeless ex-offenders, have been put in place.</P>
    <P>To date, the emphasis has been on the provision of emergency accommodation and it is now widely acknowledged that the availability of this type of accommodation, where the majority of homeless persons are currently housed, is generally adequate to meet existing needs. The next challenge is to ensure that more permanent accommodation becomes available to those homeless persons who wish to and are in a position to avail of it. The preparation of the housing action plans currently being finalised by local authorities will facilitate the planning and provision of such accommodation. In this context, it is estimated that the funding available will enable local authorities to meet the housing needs of 13,000 households in 2004 compared with 8,500 in 1998.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 275 together.</P>
    <P>On foot of public consultation in 2003 on a discussion paper for a strategy to reduce emissions of transboundary air pollution by 2010, a number of detailed submissions were received by my Department. These are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The consultation process is informing the ongoing development of a draft strategy to reduce the national emissions concerned to the required levels by 2010. I intend bringing the strategy to Government for approval later this year, prior to publication.</P>
    <P>In the context of the strategy preparation, I made the National Emission Ceiling Regulations 2004 on 13 January 2004. These specify national emission ceilings for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia to be achieved by 2010 under the strategy.</P>
    <P>Other measures relevant to the strategy are being actively pursued. I submitted a national emission reduction plan for large combustion plants to the European Commission for assessment in November 2003. The plan, under Directive 2001/80/EC, on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plants with a rated thermal input greater than 50 MW, requires significant reductions of emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from older ESB power plants and boilers in Aughinish Alumina from 2008. This ambitious environmental measure has been undertaken as a direct response to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU directive on national emission ceilings.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently five cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action in relation to non-implementation of EU directives in areas for which my Department has responsibility. The first four cases where legal action has been initiated arise in relation to directives concerning: dangerous substances in water; the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as environmental impact assessment or EIA; the keeping of wild animals in zoos, and end-of-life vehicles. The fifth case relates to a number of waste issues.</P>
    <P>Legislation transporting the relevant directives is in place in respect of each of the above five cases, and the legal actions relate to issues regarding elements of transposition and implementation. The European Commission has indicated its intention to withdraw the case in relation to the zoos directive and confirmation of that decision is awaited.</P>
    <P>Legal action has also been taken by the Commission against Ireland in relation to reporting requirements under an EU regulation on ozone depleting substances. A defence has been lodged. The European Commission announced on 22 July 2003 its intention to take legal action against Ireland in relation to the decision by the Government to introduce a &euro;20 charge on citizens wishing to make submissions on development consent procedures. The Commission also announced on 29 January 2004 its intention to take legal action against Ireland for alleged failure to designate a sufficient number of special protection areas, SPAs, for wild birds and adequately to protect sites that have or require SPA status. No communication has been received from the European Court of Justice on either matter.</P>

	<P>On 7 August 2002, the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002, S.I. No. 388 of 2002, came into operation on foot of Directive No. 2000/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. These regulations largely replaced the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997, which applied to State, semi-State and certain designated entities. The European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 apply to all commercial transactions with the following exceptions: contracts made before 7 August 2002; claims for payment of late interest of less than &euro;5; transactions with consumers and debts that may be subject to legislation other than these regulations.</P>
    <P>It is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest &mdash; late payment interest &mdash; on the amount outstanding. Interest shall apply until such time as payment is made by the purchaser. The current interest rate is 9% per annum or .0247% on a daily basis. It is calculated at seven percentage points above the European Central Bank interest rate to its most recent main refinancing operation carried out before 1 January and 1 July each year. In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties, late payment interest falls due after 30 days have elapsed.</P>
    <P>The use of terms that are grossly unfair may be unenforceable and such terms may be challenged in court. Criteria for testing whether terms are grossly unfair are specified in the regulations and such terms may also be challenged by organisations representing small and medium <Col N="1641"/>sized enterprises. The regulations also provide for debt recovery costs.</P>
    <P>Since these regulations were made, my Department has been advising purchasers and suppliers to agree mutually acceptable credit terms prior to any commercial transaction. I consider this matter is very much related to the area of contract law and I do not have any plans to introduce legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>As failure to pay late payment interest is a civil and not a criminal matter there are no provisions in the regulations for enforcing the debt as there are already established procedures for pursuing such debt through the civil courts. A review of these procedures would be a matter for my colleague, Deputy McDowell, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>The price of oil has been historically high for some months now, hitting a 14 year high of $40 dollars a barrel on Friday, 7 May having been as low as $25 per barrel in early September 2003. Crude prices have however fallen back slightly from this high although following events in Saudi Arabia last weekend the price situation remains volatile.</P>
    <P>My Department is not proposing to prepare a report on the implications of the present increase in oil prices. The situation will be taken into account in the economic review and outlook which is prepared by the Department of Finance due to be published in August. Specific scenarios are not being prepared. Considerable work in this area has already been carried out by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The International Energy Agency has warned that a sustained increase in oil prices would have an adverse effect on GDP and inflation in the eurozone. The continued importance of building our competitiveness remains the key issue for Ireland in the face of adverse global economic conditions.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 82, 83 and 85 to 87, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>As part of the decentralisation programme announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget 2004 speech, a minimum of 250 staff of my Department are to decentralise to Carlow. Four agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, F&Aacute;S, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and Enterprise Ireland, will also be relocating to Birr, Arklow, Thomastown and Shannon, respectively. A decentralisation implementation committee has been established within my Department to develop the decentralisation proposals and to drive the process across the Department and its agencies. The Secretary General of my Department, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for adherence to public financial procedures and ensuring that <Col N="1643"/>there is an effective system of corporate governance in place. The Secretary General provides advice to me on an ongoing basis as Accounting Officer.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are adequate systems of internal financial control in place in my Department to ensure compliance with public financial procedures. In March 2004, the Secretary General of my Department, as Accounting Officer, signed a statement on internal financial control in respect of the 2003 appropriation account, acknowledging responsibility for ensuring that an effective system of internal financial controls is in place, maintained and operated by the Department. As has been the situation until now, the Secretary General will continue to keep me apprised of the impacts of decentralisation on my Department.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the timetable set out in the Mullarkey report, my Department is currently in the process of putting in place a risk management programme which will be rolled out throughout my Department beginning in June 2004. As the Mullarkey report envisages, this risk management programme is designed to deal with strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks whether related to decentralisation or otherwise and provides a process for managing risks which arise.</P>
    <P>My Department and the relevant agencies along with all other decentralising public bodies, are currently finalising decentralisation implementation plans, as required by the report of the decentralisation implementation group, the Flynn group. These are initial plans which will require further development as additional information emerges in relation to the people, property and business issues identified in the implementation group&rsquo;s report. In particular, information emerging from the central applications facility in terms of staff numbers and grades electing to transfer to decentralising Departments and agencies will be crucial to the development of risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas of my Department identified for decentralisation to Carlow have already undergone business process re-engineering exercises in the recent past. These BPRs will need to be revisited in the context of decentralisation. Moves to enhance the use of ICT are also underway and offer the prospect of greater efficiencies and effectiveness in the delivery of services to be decentralised. Following the preparation of the implementation plans, an overall assessment framework, which will assess direct and indirect risks, threats to, and opportunities for synergies between my Department&rsquo;s offices and its agencies following decentralisation will be progressed.</P>
    <P>Given the overall risk assessment framework proposed, there are currently no plans for the audit committee to undertake a separate risk assessment of the impact of decentralisation on <Col N="1644"/>the Department&rsquo;s activities. I do not consider that my Department&rsquo;s annual report would be the most appropriate means of publication of decentralisation assessment reports. These reports will be made available to all key stakeholders.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 101 together.</P>
    <P>The current policy in relation to suspect BSE animals is to euthanase them on the farm of origin. I do not propose to change this policy. My Department also depopulates the whole cattle herd where a case of BSE has been confirmed and traces and slaughters any cohort or progeny animal of the BSE positive case.</P>
    <P>At present these animals, which are not suspected of having BSE, are slaughtered in a dedicated plant. This plant has not always been exclusively dedicated to this function. However, with increasing numbers of BSE cases being identified following the introduction of active surveillance in the latter half of 2000, it became necessary for my Department to contract this plant on an exclusive basis, primarily to avoid delays for farmers whose herds were being slaughtered.</P>
    <P>The current contract for the slaughter of BSE herds came into effect on 1 January 2001. With the welcome decline in the number of BSE cases in 2003 &mdash; 45% &mdash; and 2004 &mdash; 35% to date &mdash; my Department considers that a contractual arrangement entered into at a time when significant increases in the number of BSE cases were anticipated needs to be reviewed. Against this background, and in accordance with best practice, my Department has recently invited proposals from slaughter facilities to tender for this business.</P>
    <P>Those submitting proposals are required to make their premises available exclusively to the Department on the days on which depopulated herds and other animals are to be slaughtered, and to adhere to all of the relevant statutory requirements, in particular those in Council <Col N="1647"/>Regulation 1774/2002 relating to the disposal of the resultant animal by-products. Standard operating procedures governing the cleaning and disinfection of the premises following the slaughter of depopulated herds will also be put in place. The successful tenderer will also be required to make its premises available within two days of being requested to do so by the Department, in order to avoid any delay for farmers whose herds are to be depopulated.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 98 and 102 to 104, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The Government announced the details of its decentralisation programme in December last year. The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn presented its initial report to Government on 31 March 2004. In this report the DIG requested that all Departments produce an implementation plan by the end of May. My Department&rsquo;s plan has in recent days been finalised and submitted to the DIG. The State bodies under the aegis of my Department are requested to prepare and submit their own individual implementation plans. Since the announcement of the decision to decentralise, my Department has consulted with its staff and kept them informed of all developments on an ongoing basis. This has been achieved through the Department&rsquo;s partnership committees &mdash; the departmental council and bilateral discussions with individual trade unions. Also a decentralisation unit has been established and a dedicated site has been created on the Department&rsquo;s Intranet, e-zone, to keep staff appraised of developments.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures have led to the morale of my staff being maintained and it is worth reiterating the fact that the programme is voluntary. It is anticipated that many staff of my Department will apply to transfer to a decentralisation location in this and other Departments-agencies under the central applications facility, CAF. The CAF which was launched recently by the Civil Service Commission will facilitate further the planning of the decentralisation process and the initial information from the CAF will be submitted to the DIG. next month which in turn will make detailed recommendations to Government on the timetable for the various aspects of the programme as a whole.</P><Col N="1649"/>
    <P>My Department established an implementation committee which is headed by an Assistant Secretary to oversee all aspects of the programme. This committee is considering all aspects of the decentralisation process and will report on the key issues to the Secretary General and myself. I am satisfied that all the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the decentralisation process is implemented in an economic and efficient manner for the administration of the services provided by my Department. This committee has also commenced the process of identifying and categorising the risks associated with decentralisation. The main risks are expected to come under the headings of service delivery, financial, human resources and accommodation. Proposals to deal with identified risks will be submitted to the Department&rsquo;s risk management committee and the audit committee. This process will be carried out in accordance with our now established procedures for risk management.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s annual report will also deal with the issue of decentralisation along the lines required by the Mullarkey report. Freedom of information requests for access to any information which is not immediately made publicly available for any reason will in the normal course be dealt with under all the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.</P>

	<P>I have no statutory responsibility for the protection of feral goats nor do I have a statutory basis on which I could introduce legislation for the protection of these animals. In so far as the area of the Burren which constitutes the national park is concerned, its management and responsibility for flora and fauna within its boundaries fall within the remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It would also be for that Department to assess the potential of the Wildlife Act 1976, to afford protection to feral goats. The <Col N="1651"/>Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also has responsibility for the habitats directive and for special areas of conservation, which may also have a relevance to this particular matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 108, 110, 111 and 114 together.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the detailed decentralisation programme which I announced last December took account of all the advices I received as part of the extensive consultation with interested parties which followed my original announcement in December 1999 that the Government intended to embark upon a new programme of decentralisation. In addition to the representations I received from interested towns across the country and submissions from staff interests, the views of Departments and offices who had participated in the previous decentralisation programme were sought and received. In addition, the strategic management initiative implementation group of Secretaries General provided advice, at the request of the Government, on how implementation of the new programme could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.</P>
    <P>I appreciate all the advice I received in the four-year period leading up to my detailed announcement. However, as I have made clear <Col N="1653"/>on many occasions, decisions about the selection of organisations and locations for inclusion in the new programme were, ultimately, a matter for Ministers and the Government. I refer the Deputy to the summary of 2004 budget measures, page B.25, which sets out the wide range of factors which have been taken into account in reaching these decisions.</P>
    <P>Immediately following my announcement of the new programme, I appointed an implementation group to prepare an overall implementation plan in co-operation with all of the organisations involved. In its first report of 31 March 2004, the group recommends that each organisation participating in the programme should prepare its own implementation plan and submit them to the group by the end of May 2004. These initial implementation plans will require further development as additional information emerges in relation to the people, property and business issues identified in the implementation group&rsquo;s report. However, I expect them to address issues such as service and business continuity, efficiency and effectiveness and financial implications. The plans must, in particular, incorporate specific risk assessment and mitigation strategies.</P>
    <P>The question of publishing the implementation plans is a matter for each Minister. I can assure the Deputy, however, that I will be happy to arrange for the publication of my Department&rsquo;s plan and the plans of agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, after they have been made available to the implementation group and to staff interests. In relation to the issue of public financial procedures generally, I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the requirement in the public financial procedures for Accounting Officers to ensure that all relevant financial considerations are taken fully into account, and where necessary brought to the attention of Ministers, in relation to the preparation and implementation of policy proposals relating to expenditure or income. In addition there is an ongoing awareness in my Department of the type of risks identified in paragraph 6.31 of the report of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers (the Mullarkey report). I can confirm that all of these issues are regularly addressed in my Department. The issue of risk is a standing item on the Department&rsquo;s audit committee agenda.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to make it clear that I am convinced decentralisation offers considerable benefits for the organisations involved, the communities to which they will be relocated, the staff that will transfer and the country as a whole. I fully support the statement in the implementation group&rsquo;s report:</P>
    <P LI="1">It can be all too easy to list off the potential problems associated with decentralisation. The real challenge is to identify the issues arising from decentralisation and how they are to be tackled as opportunities for the future development of an even better public service.</P>

The Department of Finance is currently progressing its own internal risk management strategy. The audit committee will have an advisory role in relation to best practice on risk management for this Department. Since the beginning of this year the audit committee has requested that recommendations in internal audit reports be grouped according to risk.

     <Quest>the tax liability that an old aged pensioner will be liable for on the sale of land to a non family member to the value of &euro;100,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that if <Col N="1655"/>the land formed part of the grounds of up to one acre of the seller&rsquo;s principal private residence, there would be no liability to capital gains tax unless the sale was one of development land. Otherwise, as a general principle, the capital gain on the sale of land is taxable.</P>
    <P>The capital gains tax liability of an old age pensioner on the sale of land to a non-family member for &euro;100,000 will be computed by reference to the chargeable gain on the sale. The chargeable gain is essentially the excess of the sale proceeds, net of incidental costs of sale, over the allowable costs of acquisition of the land being sold. If there were no other chargeable gains in the year, this gain is then reduced by the annual personal exemption of &euro;1,270 or &euro;2,540 if the land is held in joint names with a spouse. The net chargeable gain is taxable at 20%. If the Deputy wishes to supply further details to the Revenue Commissioners a more precise reply can be given. In calculating the tax due, the following factors are relevant. Incidental costs of sale include legal and auctioneers costs.</P><P>The cost of valuations required to calculate the gain are also allowed. Allowable costs of acquisition include the actual cost of the land, inclusive of incidental costs. These are similar to the incidental costs incurred on sale and also include stamp duty. If the land was acquired by way of a gift or inheritance the cost of acquisition is its market value at the date of gift or death. If it was acquired prior to 6 April 1974, the market value at 6 April 1974 is substituted for the cost of acquisition. Expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred to enhance the land or to establish, preserve or defend title to or right over the land is also allowable. If the land being sold is part of a larger holding the allowable costs may need to be apportioned by reference to the part disposal rules. Allowable expenditure incurred before 1 January 2003 and more than 12 months prior to sale may be adjusted for inflation by reference to the date on which the expenditure was incurred. This relief is restricted if the sale is one of development land. Development land means land in the State the consideration for the disposal of which exceeds the current use value of that land at the time of sale. Retirement relief may be available if the land had been owned and used by the seller for the purposes of farming or a trade for a period of not less than ten years ending with the sale.</P>

	<P>All paper used by my Department at headquarters is ordered on the basis of draw-down contracts entered into by the Government Supplies Agency. It is the policy of the Government Supplies Agency to use recycled paper wherever possible. All manila file covers and the majority of envelopes used by my Department are composed of 100% recycled paper. The envelopes also qualify for the blue angel logo which is an internationally recognised environmental accreditation.</P>
    <P>My Department has previously ordered photocopy paper from recycled sources but, in addition to being more expensive than the non-recycled type, this has been found to be of inferior quality. Further efforts will be made, in consultation with the Government Supplies Agency, to source high-quality recycled photocopy paper at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>With regard to departmental headed stationery, paper from non-recycled sources has been used to date. However, I am in the process of selecting a new style of letterhead for the Department. When this selection has been made, a new supplier will be chosen from the current Government Supplies Agency draw-down contract. It is my Department&rsquo;s intention at that stage to specify the maximum possible recycled content that meets the quality and price required. All EU Presidency stationery ordered by my Department has the maximum possible recycled content compatible with quality and durability.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has expressed its concern at the discrimination experienced by foreign teaching staff in Italian universities and has made representations to this effect to the Italian authorities. The Government is continuing to monitor this issue closely and will undertake further representations as appropriate. Article 228 enforcement actions are a matter for the European Commission and the member state concerned. The Presidency of the Council, as such, does not have a role in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as Presidency of the Council, has sought in general to advance the issue of labour mobility, with the aim of improving opportunities for workers taking up employment in other EU member states. To this end, the Irish Presidency secured political agreement in Council on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and europass dossiers, both of which are intended <Col N="1657"/>to facilitate the recognition of educational and professional qualifications throughout the EU. It also finalised the reform of regulation 1408 which makes it easier for EU residents to access social security entitlements in other EU member states.</P>

	<P>My Department, through the consular section, the Irish Embassy in Madrid and the Honorary Consulate in Las Palmas, has been providing extensive consular assistance to the family of the person in question since April 2003 when we became aware of the case. The person mentioned sustained fatal injuries on holiday in Gran Canaria on 27 April 2003 and died in Las Palmas General Hospital on 13 May 2003.</P>
    <P>While he was being treated in the hospital, the Irish Ambassador in Madrid made representations to the director of health services for the Canary Islands to secure more extensive access to the intensive care unit of the hospital for the family. The Honorary Consul&rsquo;s assistant attended the hospital to act as a translator and provide general assistance to the family.</P>
    <P>Following his death, the embassy and Honorary Consul continued their efforts on behalf of the family, providing the names of English-speaking lawyers, maintaining continuous contact with the investigating police, forwarding official medical reports and the autopsy, and the official police report to the family. Also during this time, the Honorary Consulate, the embassy and the consular section remained in direct contact with the person&rsquo;s family.</P>
    <P>I understand the person&rsquo;s family sought the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in September 2003. They interviewed a large number of Irish holidaymakers who were in Gran Canaria at the time of the incident. Subsequently, a Garda chief superintendent travelled to Gran Canaria to report on their efforts to the Spanish police. In addition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wrote to his Spanish counterpart about the case.</P>
    <P>An inquest into the person&rsquo;s death was opened by Dublin City Coroner on 26 November 2003 and was adjourned until 26 February 2004 when it was further adjourned until 23 June 2004, when further evidence will be taken. At my request, the embassy in Madrid made formal representations to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 17 May 2004 requesting their assistance in expediting the transmission of a copy of the investigation file from the Spanish authorities which is required by the Garda authorities for this inquest hearing. Pending a judicial decision on the matter, police investigations are continuing. I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has no plans to assume responsibility as employer for the teachers engaged by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. Issues relating to the tax affairs are a matter between the Dyslexia Association and the individual teachers concerned. The question of exempting voluntary groups from tax requirements is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and my Department would have no role in this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that my Department is currently developing a weighted system of allocation of teaching support for schools to cater for pupils with special needs, including those with dyslexia. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will: reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 138 together.</P>
    <P>I confirm that on 5 February 2004 my Department received an application for special educational resources, SER, for the pupils referred to by the Deputy, who are due to commence school on 1 September 2004. The school in question currently has the services of one full-time and one part-time resource teacher and one learning support teacher and two special needs assistants. The position is that SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P><Col N="1666"/>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will: reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year.</P>

My Department is reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome. I wish to point out, however, that the basic purpose of that review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>

    <P>Following from the recommendations contained in the first report of the decentralisation implementation group, each Department and agency has been asked to draw up initial implementation plans. These plans will address, among other issues, the risks associated <Col N="1668"/>with decentralisation and the means of mitigating those risks. The plans are being prepared both within my Department and by the agencies operating under its aegis and when completed, all of the material will be sent, through the Department of Finance, to the decentralisation implementation group.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2003 is being drafted. It is not proposed to include an analysis of, or material on decentralisation in the 2003 annual report. It is intended that these matters will be addressed in reports for subsequent years as the programme of decentralisation is implemented.</P>
    <P>My Department has set up a decentralisation group which will report regularly to the Secretary General and the management advisory committee of my Department on all issues relating to decentralisation, including issues relating to the business impact of the programme and the potential for rationalising existing business processes within my Department. Any matters arising from the work of this group will be brought to my attention on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <P>My Department is currently preparing its initial implementation plan for the decentralisation programme which,<i> inter alia</i>, addresses financial management and control perspectives, taking account of public financial procedures and the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer. It also takes account of the relevant financial considerations inherent in progressing the decentralisation plans for my Department. The plan will also outline the Department&rsquo;s approach to business process review with a view to delivering enhanced efficiency and service delivery as part of the process of decentralisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 166 and 168 to 170, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the decentralisation implementation group, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn, in its first report dated 31 March 2004, recommended that each organisation participating in the decentralisation programme should prepare its own implementation plan and submit it to the group. Officials in my Department are finalising the Department&rsquo;s initial implementation plan, which will address the main issues arising from the decentralisation of the Department to Killarney. The plans will be further developed as additional information becomes available in respect of the issues relating to people, property and business, as identified in the Flynn report.</P>
    <P>The plan identifies the main risks associated with the move and outlines strategies to mitigate such risks. The Secretary General of my Department is particularly conscious of the issues, such as service and business continuity, efficiency and effectiveness and financial implications, and intends that strategies will be put in place to minimise any such risks. I am happy to arrange for the publication of my Department&rsquo;s plan and the plans of the agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis as soon as possible after the plans have been made available to the implementation group and to staff interests.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of public financial procedures generally, I assure the Deputy that along with the management advisory committee &mdash; MAC &mdash; in my Department, I review all ongoing programmes and potential future activities on a regular basis. As required in the public financial procedures, the Secretary General and officials of my Department provide me with full and comprehensive briefing, including relevant financial considerations, regarding the preparation and implementation of policy proposals relating to expenditure. In addition, there is an ongoing awareness in my Department of the type of risks identified in paragraph 6.31 of the report of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers, the Mullarkey report. I <Col N="1678"/>confirm that all of these issues are regularly addressed in my Department.</P>
    <P>I would have no difficulty in ensuring that my Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2004 will contain an assessment of the risks associated with decentralisation and the strategies that my Department proposes to overcome such risks.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards-authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to <Col N="1680"/>specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities and will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001. This has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards-authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>The Northern Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority previously proposed a grant in aid scheme for orthodontic treatment similar to that referred to by the Deputy. However, the board received legal advice to the effect that such a scheme would conflict with the statutory provisions of the Health Act 1970.</P>
    <P>As part of the implementation process for the national health strategy, a review of all existing eligibility legislation is being undertaken in my Department. Arising from this review, legislation will be drafted to clarify and simplify eligibility and entitlements to health services in line with the goals and objectives set out in the strategy.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, 21,033 children were receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means nearly twice as many children are receiving orthodontic treatment as are waiting to be treated and almost 4,000 extra children have been receiving treatment from health boards-authority since the end of 2001.</P>

	<P>There has been no formal request for a meeting from any of the professional bodies which represent chiropodists on this matter. Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services. However, arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody, are a matter for the individual health boards to make having regard to their priorities within the funding allocated. Accordingly, chiropody services provided by health boards vary somewhat throughout the country. Any contractual arrangements are between the relevant health board and the service provider. However, my Department has indicated its disapproval of the practice of levying an additional charge by the chiropodists in some board areas and discussions are taking place in this regard with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

	<P>No agreement was made or commitment given by my Department to higher education institutions or any other party for the payment of full fees for students undertaking doctoral studies in clinical psychology. The terms of the model agreed jointly by my Department with the health boards&rsquo; directors of human resources group to assist students in undertaking postgraduate training in clinical psychology provides for each student a contribution towards fees of &euro;6,000 on an annual basis for the three years of the course in addition to a bursary payment of &euro;18,000 per annum. I understand that this level of financial support compares favourably with that available to postgraduate students generally. The current model was adopted to support the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services to substantially increase the number of postgraduate training places in clinical psychology to meet human resource requirements for the health service while securing the best return on the significant resources currently invested in this training area.</P>

	<P>Due to unavoidable Presidency commitments, I was unable to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on Thursday, 27 May. As I advised the House last week, I am happy to reschedule a date in the near future and very much look forward to meeting the joint committee to discuss in detail my plans for the development of radiation oncology nationally. I have outlined to the House on several occasions recently Government policy in this area. I have also outlined the significant progress made in implementing the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland which is the most important priority in cancer services in the acute hospital setting.</P>
    <P>The joint committee has heard detailed presentations from a number of clinicians in relation to radiation oncology services. One of the participants was Professor Donal Hollywood, who chaired the expert group that produced the report. In his presentation to the committee he set out the basis of the model for the development of radiation oncology services nationally which ensures both quality and equity.</P>
    <P>The report, which has been endorsed by Government, has received significant additional endorsement from prestigious bodies such as the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute in the US. In addition, the faculty of radiologists of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has advised the chief medical officer of my Department that the report and its comprehensive recommendations have been completely endorsed by the faculty.</P>
    <P>I have provided additional resources this year to progress the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The immediate developments in the southern and western regions will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. We have also provided for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Recruitment for these posts is underway. We currently have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that there should be two treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. The chief medical officer of my Department has been asked to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. A detailed request for submissions will be available to relevant hospitals shortly. The chief medical officer will <Col N="1688"/>apply the guidelines established by the group and will be supported by the hospital planning office of my Department and international experts.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology, based on equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme. As recommended in the report, I have established the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. Its remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. I expect the group to develop proposals in these important areas.</P>

	<P>The 1996 national cancer strategy has led to substantial investment in cancer treatment services and significant improvements in the organisation and delivery of the services. Since 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;550 million in the development of cancer services nationally. This includes an additional sum of &euro;15 million which was allocated in 2004 for cancer services nationally. This substantial investment has enabled the funding of 92 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology, haematology and radiation oncology. An additional 245 clinical nurse specialists have also been appointed in the cancer services area.</P>
	<P>A cumulative total of almost &euro;42 million has been allocated to the South Eastern Health Board since 1997 for the development of cancer services including &euro;1.16 million to address service pressures in 2004. This has enabled the funding of the following additional 10 consultant staff &mdash; three medical oncologists, two surgeons with special interest in breast care, one histopathologist, one radiologist, one haematologist, one palliative care and one surgeon. An additional 26 clinical nurse specialists have also been appointed.</P>
    <P>With regard to symptomatic breast disease, the board has a dedicated unit in Waterford Regional Hospital with a full complement of multidisciplinary staff as set out in the report on development of services for symptomatic breast disease, that is, breast surgeon, oncologist, radiologist, pathologist and nurse specialist. Three surgeons with a special interest in breast <Col N="1689"/>surgery in the board&rsquo;s area have sessional commitments to the unit.</P>
    <P>Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to Counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and also the national roll-out to the southern and western counties. BreastCheck commenced screening in Wexford in March of this year.</P>
    <P>As regards radiotherapy services, my Department has issued approval for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital and the necessary capital investment amounting to more than &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. Approval has also issued for the appointment of two consultant radiation oncologists, one of whom has significant sessional commitments to the South Eastern Health Board. In 2004, &euro;1 million in ongoing revenue funding is available for this development, which will ensure cancer patients in the south east have equitable access to increases in radiotherapy capacity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 208, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>Risk assessment and mitigation measures associated with the decentralisation programme will be outlined in decentralisation implementation plans being drawn up by my Department and each of its organisations included in the decentralisation programme. These issues will also be taken into account in the overall risk assessment programme being developed in my Department. In developing that programme, a preliminary assessment to identify the main risks facing my Department was carried out by senior managers under the coaching and direction of risk management consultants. Building on this work a firm of consultants is at present engaged in the task of helping my Department to draw up a formal risk management strategy to address the full range of issues faced by the Department including strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks. The audit committee will be consulted on the development of this strategy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of public financial procedures generally, I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the requirement in the public financial procedures for accounting officers to ensure that all relevant financial considerations are taken fully into account, and where necessary brought to my attention, in relation to the preparation and implementation of policy proposals relating to expenditure or income. All these issues are regularly addressed in my Department. The decentralisation implementation plans will provide further input into the consideration of financial and other aspects of that programme. These plans will be kept under review and further developed as the programme progresses and additional information becomes available.</P>

	<P>The five persons in question <Col N="1693"/>made visa applications in May 2003. The applications were refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas. It was noted the five visa applicants named the same Irish national as their sponsor in Ireland and stated he would help support them during their stay with him. The Irish sponsor&rsquo;s address was given as the address of destination. No prior existing relationship with the Irish sponsor was evident. No date was given for their departure from the State. An appeal against the refusal of the applications was received. However, the visa appeals officer, having re-examined the applications, upheld the original decision to refuse them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in the details supplied, refers to a non-EEA national in Ireland who is a relative of the five adults and who invited them to visit him in the State. No mention was made of this person in the visa applications, nor is there a prior relationship between the five adults who submitted the applications to each other or to the person named by the Deputy. In this context, all five applicants indicated on their application forms that they would not be accompanied by other family members during their visit to Ireland. Each of the five applicants signed the declaration on the visa application forms to the effect that they understood all the questions relating to the application and that, to the best of their knowledge, the details they gave were correct and complete. This may not have been the case. It is open to the applicants to make fresh applications with up-to-date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.</P>

    <P FLI="0">On the basis of statistics available for 2003 the percentage of rejected applications for asylum exceeds 90%.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, two independent statutory offices consider applications-appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, which considers applications for refugee status at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, which considers appeals from negative recommendations of the commissioner. Decisions on asylum applications are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon receipt of the recommendation-decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am informed that detailed records are not kept on the breakdown of the grounds on which applicants are granted refugee status. However, all applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, and, in particular, having due regard to the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of that Act, which states that a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
    <P>In considering an asylum claim, consideration is given to the subjective and objective elements of the application. The subjective element of an asylum application concerns the applicant&rsquo;s individual circumstances as they are perceived and described by him or her. The objective element of the application concerns the relevant country of origin information which comes from a wide variety of sources including information from organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, US State Department, Canadian immigration authorities and other EU member states as well as media and Internet <Col N="1696"/>sources. In addition to these periodically updated sources, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal have access to up to date news reports regarding events and developments in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>While the costs arising from the provision of services to asylum seekers are primarily a matter for the individual Departments and agencies with responsibility for such services, the most recent information available indicates the amount spent on asylum seeker services for 2003, which also includes immigration functions such as the operation of the deportation process, was in the region of &euro;353 million spread between a number of Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>In the case of costs directly associated with the processing of asylum claims which are met from my Department&rsquo;s Vote, these amounted to &euro;30 million in 2003 and included expenditure by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Refugee Legal Service on such items as the servicing of asylum interviews and appeals hearings, payments for translation and interpretation services and legal fees. In 2003, the total cost to my Department and the asylum agencies of asylum and immigration services was in the region of &euro;120 million. This included costs directly associated with the processing of asylum applications and also expenditure on, for example, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers and the operation of the deportation process.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the Government&rsquo;s asylum strategy including the operation of the wide ranging amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 contained in the Immigration Act 2003, which were aimed at, <i>inter alia</i>, streamlining the asylum decision making process, has had a positive impact in terms of processing times and partly resulted in the second highest reduction in asylum applications in any EU state in 2003. While continued reduction in asylum applications can be expected to have an impact on the resources allocated to services for asylum seekers in the future, expenditure in this area will have to be maintained at such a level as to ensure the efficient and effective processing of applications in particular.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provision of immigration-related services generally will continue to require an adequate level of resources so as to ensure that these also continue to be provided in an efficient and effective manner. This will include resources, for example, for the operation of the deportation process and for the processing of applications for visas and citizenship all of which have been on the increase in recent years.</P>

	<P>A person who has been granted refugee status may apply for permission to be granted to a member of his or her family to enter and reside in the State under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. Under section 18(3) such permission must, save in exceptional cases, be granted to immediate family members, that is, spouses, minor children and, if the refugee himself is an unmarried minor, his parents, upon verification by the Refugee Applications Commissioner of the authenticity of the relationship. Applications for family reunification may also be made for dependent members of a refugee&rsquo;s family under section 18(4). Dependent members of the family mean any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on the refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully. Such applications may be granted at my discretion.</P>

     <Quest>the measures he and his Department are to take in regard to tackling the problem of bogus language schools which are being used as a cover for trafficking migrant workers into Ireland; and if his attention has been drawn to the concerns that this is leading to widespread illegality and exploitation of the workers involved.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully supportive of efforts made by various State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the <Col N="1698"/>International Education Board of Ireland to promote Ireland as a centre of educational excellence. While my Department has an important role to play in combating abuse in the sector, that role is but one aspect of the ongoing regulatory arrangements which are necessary in order to achieve and sustain the desired objective.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory and compulsory registration system for language schools in the State, although the English language sector is the subject of an entirely voluntary registration system operated under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science &mdash; the advisory council for English language schools. While my Department is represented on the board of that body, I cannot have responsibility for all sectors of economic activity in which non-EEA nationals are engaged. For example, I do not have responsibility for the regulation of businesses, notwithstanding that many of them rely heavily on non-EEA nationals. Similarly, the only circumstance where immigration officials have interaction with language schools is where non-EEA national students are in attendance.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that increased efforts to combat illegal immigration are accompanied by greater attempted exploitation of legal migratory routes &mdash; including the educational route. However, it is not the case that immigration officials have available to them a specified list of language schools by reference to which every school can be deemed to be genuine or bogus. This is compounded by the fact that new schools are being established regularly to satisfy demand and there is competition between schools for students who are here. There have also been increased efforts to support student visa applications with false documentation or information &mdash; supplied either by the students or foreign agents who are employed by schools themselves.</P>
    <P>A rigorous regime is employed to determine visa applications and personnel from my Department are employed in the embassies in Moscow and Beijing, the latter being the primary source of student visa applications for this jurisdiction. In addition, immigration officers with the assistance of the Garda national immigration bureau&rsquo;s computerised information system and other specialised equipment now have the capacity to check the authenticity of passports and visas at a wide variety of locations throughout the State and to determine the number of students whose residence is based on attendance at a school. It is not simply the case that bogus schools cause problems; it is also the case that bogus students use the facilities provided by genuine schools to acquire residence in the State for purposes which are not primarily study related.</P>
    <P>In the context of the powers vested in me for the purposes of the control of non-nationals, where evidence of a consistent pattern of abuse emerges this results in a refusal to issue visas for <Col N="1699"/>students who propose to attend a particular establishment.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, chairs an interdepartmental group, which was established to address a range of issues connected with the internationalisation of Irish educational services and which will report to Government in due course.

    <P>From a legislative point of view, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 targets professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 47 of 26 February 2004. Since the opening of the D&oacute;chas centre in 1999, there has been a serious overcrowding problem there, even with the benefit of an additional 20 spaces provided in the final phase of its construction. This serious shortage of spaces for women prisoners frequently forces the prison authorities to seek temporary release for lower level female offenders. I do not regard this as an acceptable situation.</P>
    <P>Social trends across Europe indicate we will continue to experience an increasing number of women prisoners in our system in the future. It is the intention, therefore, to replicate an expanded version of the D&oacute;chas centre in the plans to move the entire Mountjoy Prison complex to a greenfield site in the greater Dublin area. While the full details of the relocation of the Mountjoy Prison complex have not been decided upon, the sale of all or part of the existing Mountjoy site could go to funding the new complex.</P>

	<P>My responsibility, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for the custody of juveniles is, in normal circumstances, limited to male offenders aged 16 and over and female offenders aged 17 and over. However, 15 year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders may be committed to prison in exceptional circumstances. This should occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act 1908 that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he or she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of that Act. Such committals are used only as a last resort by the courts and, therefore, the number of 15 year old males and 15 or 16 year old females committed to prison each year on such certificates of unruliness is low.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to separate juvenile offenders from the general prison population in each institution. In practice, the vast majority of male offenders aged 16 and 17 years are held in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is a closed institution reserved in law exclusively for offenders aged 16 to 21 years. For example, on 31 May 2004 there were 75 persons under the age of 18 in custody, 64 of whom were detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The few held in the more traditional adult prisons are accommodated with other young offenders or with other carefully selected prisoners.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts, either on remand or under sentence. These secure detention centres will operate under their own unique regime which will cater specifically for the needs of juvenile offenders. The plans for the new Mountjoy and Spike Island Prison complexes will include such detention centres with separate sections devoted to both male and females aged 16 to 17 year olds.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 is complex and comprehensive legislation and, for that reason, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment. Responsibility for implementing the Act lies with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile <Col N="1701"/>offending and the Department of Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children&rsquo;s Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>Three main areas of the Act for which I have responsibility remain to be brought into operation. These concern the age of criminal responsibility, community-based options, and the provision of children detention centres for 16 and 17 year old offenders. One of the primary aims of the Children Act is to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. The community-based options provided for in the Act will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. The service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand, for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required. It is the intention that community sanctions provided for in the Act will be introduced on a phased basis commencing later this month.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act 2001, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old males and females who are committed to custody by the courts on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</P>
    <P>In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles &mdash; 90 male and 20 female &mdash; is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred <Col N="1702"/>with the director general of the Irish Prison Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, will not proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is being pursued in consultation with the director general and the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <P>In its first report, entitled An Examination of the Feasibility of Introducing a Public Defender System for Ireland, which was published in February 2000, the committee recommended that the existing system for providing criminal legal aid was the most equitable, effective and economic at that time. The committee also examined the issue of whether a fee should be paid to solicitors for consultations with persons detained in Garda stations and made an interim report to the Department. On foot of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, the Garda station legal advice scheme was introduced in February 2001.</P>

     <Quest>the entitlements of adoptive parents to leave for the purpose of undergoing the various preparatory requirements in advance of adoption and in the period after adoption; and her views on whether the present system gives adequate opportunity to adoptive parents to make time available for their adopted child.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 was introduced to provide an entitlement to leave from employment similar to maternity leave for an adopting mother after the placement of a child into her care. The Act provides an employed adopting mother or sole male adopter with 14 weeks adoptive leave, attracting payment of Department of Social and Family Affairs benefit, commencing on the date of placement and an optional eight weeks unpaid additional adoptive leave, some or all of which may be taken prior to placement in the case of a foreign adoption.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill 2004, which is progressing through the Seanad, seeks to amend the 1995 Act to apply, where appropriate, to adoptive leave the recommendations made by the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. The recommendation to increase the periods of adoptive leave from ten to 14 weeks and unpaid additional adoptive leave from four weeks to eight weeks was implemented shortly after the working group completed its deliberations.</P><Col N="1704"/>
    <P>In addition, the Adoptive Leave Bill incorporates a provision to further increase the adoptive leave period by two weeks to 16 weeks, as approved by the Government last October. The increase in adoptive leave is linked to the proposed reduction in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave. Once the two Bills are enacted, both natural and adopting mothers will be able to avail of 16 weeks leave with payment of Department of Social and Family Affairs benefit from the time a child is born or placed into their care.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a new entitlement for adopting parents to time off from work, without loss of pay, to attend the pre-adoption classes and interviews which they are obliged to attend as part of the adoption process. This new entitlement will better facilitate prospective adopting parents in meeting their work commitments while also attending the required elements of the preparatory and assessment process for adoption. I am satisfied the provisions of the Bill will offer improved employment protection and greater flexibility to employed adopting parents throughout the adoption process from the preparation stages through to placement and the during the first months after a child is received into the family.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that immediately following the Government&rsquo;s announcement of the decentralisation programme, my colleague, the Minister for Finance appointed an implementation group to prepare an overall implementation plan in co-operation with all of the organisations involved. In its first report of 31 March 2004, the group recommends that each organisation participating in the programme should prepare its own implementation plan and submit it to the group by the end of May 2004.</P>
    <P>The agencies and organisations under the aegis of my Department selected for decentralisation have prepared and submitted plans to the group. These initial implementation plans may require further development as additional information emerges in relation to the people, property and business issues identified in the implementation group&rsquo;s report. The plans incorporate specific risk assessments in the case of each agency due to decentralise and examine the effectiveness of services.</P>

In addition, there is an ongoing awareness in my Department of the type of risks identified in paragraph 6.31 of the Report of the Working Group on the Accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers &mdash; the Mullarkey report.

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four ways in which a person born outside of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship; by means of a grant as a token of honour, by descent, by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen &mdash; post-nuptial citizenship. It is assumed for the purposes of this reply that neither honorary citizenship nor citizenship by descent are relevant in the context of this question. Accordingly, I have set out general information about naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship. However, without further details, I am not in a position to advise as to which method is appropriate to the circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>A non-national married to a person who is an Irish citizen, otherwise than by naturalisation, post-nuptial declaration or honorary citizenship, may accept Irish citizenship as his-her post-nuptial citizenship by lodging a declaration not earlier than the three years from the date of the marriage &mdash; or three years from the date on which the applicant&rsquo;s spouse became an Irish citizen &mdash; whichever is the later. The marriage must be subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of the lodgement of the declaration. The continued availability of this process is finite. That is because it was repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001. However, it remains open to non-nationals who married prior to 30 November 2002 and who fulfil the statutory conditions &mdash; three years marriage, etc. This window of opportunity will cease with effect from 29 November 2005. Persons who marry on or after 30 November 2002, or persons who married prior to that date but do not avail of the post-nuptial process prior to 29 November 2005, must apply for naturalisation in accordance with the provisions that follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish national those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; good character; married to the Irish citizen for at least three years in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one years continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the <Col N="1708"/>application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>In other cases the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain, more rigorous statutory conditions are fulfilled.

	<P>Ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers have been used by terrorists to manufacture improvised explosive devices in this jurisdiction, and in Northern Ireland, for many years. For that reason, regulations were introduced in 1972 in both parts of the Island declaring ammonium nitrate and some ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers to be explosives.</P>
    <P>In particular, Statutory Instrument No. 191 of 1972, Explosives (Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chlorate ) Order 1972, declares that the substances specified in the schedule to the order shall be deemed to be explosives within the <Col N="1709"/>meaning of the Explosives Act 1875. The schedule to the order includes, <i>inter alia</i>, ammonium nitrate and certain fertilisers which contain ammonium nitrate in excess of 79% by weight. Under the terms of the order, these substances are deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Act and are, therefore, subject to the same security controls for licensing, importation and storage as conventional explosives.</P>
    <P>However, in light of recent events and the concerns expressed in relation to certain blended fertiliser imports, officials of my Department have been consulting urgently with all relevant State agencies and the industry to examine these substances with a view to making recommendations in relation to their possible control.</P>

Dealing numbers D2003WS009387E and D2004WS002605V refer. Due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take time to process. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I assure the Deputy that dealing number D2004WS002605V is receiving attention in the Land Registry.

	<P>The provisions governing local authority membership and local authority employment are set out in sections 13 and 161 of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government Act 2001, section 16, order 2004 provides that certain junior grades of local authority employees may become councillors. This order applies in the case of the 2004 and subsequent local elections. Prior to this, the position regarding local authority employees becoming councillors was provided for under the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act 1974, section 25, order 1974.</P>
    <P>My Department has no function in determining the validity of particular co-options.

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A local authority development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the planning authority&rsquo;s area through the objectives to be included in the plan. The objectives to be provided for are detailed in section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and include objectives with regard to zoning, provision of infrastructure and environmental protection. Any provision of infrastructure, including any road projects, by a local authority must be consistent with the objectives of the development plan.</P>
    <P>The selection, development and design of proposals for the improvement of non-national roads in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is a matter for D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council. Such schemes are funded from the authority&rsquo;s own resources supplemented by grants from my Department. In 2003, my Department sought applications from road authorities for funding under the 2004 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme. D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council submitted a number of applications but these did not include an application for funding for either a by-pass of Hillcrest Road in Sandyford or for the widening of Hillcrest Road. It is a matter for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to decide if it wishes to prioritise any such project for funding under the EU co-financed scheme in 2005, when <Col N="1713"/>applications are sought by my Department, later this year.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>

    <P>It is estimated that local authorities will complete-acquire in the region of 5,000 housing units in 2004. Information published as part of the last assessment of local authority housing need undertaken at the end of March 2002 indicates that approximately 60% of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years. It is, however, the case that some applicants for local authority housing are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their housing need has a relative lower priority compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. The relative priority of households on the local authority waiting lists is determined in accordance with the authorities&rsquo; scheme of letting priorities, the making of which is a function reserved to the elected members.</P>
    <P>Financial allocations of &euro;773 million were recently notified to local authorities by my Department for their main housing construction programmes and for refurbishment works to houses under the remedial works scheme as well as for the provision of Traveller accommodation. I consider that these allocations will be sufficient <Col N="1714"/>to allow authorities undertake their nominated programmes for 2004.</P>
    <P>Regarding contact with local authorities on their housing waiting lists, I refer to the reply to Question No. 4 of today on the preparation of action plans by local authorities.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The long-standing practice of levying development contributions to fund local authority infrastructure was significantly revised when the Oireachtas, with cross-party support, brought in a new, transparent system in the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under section 48 of the 2000 Act, planning authorities had to adopt development contributions schemes in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, by 10 March 2004.</P>
    <P>The schemes apply to all planning permissions granted after the adoption of the schemes. It is not possible to estimate the anticipated return in a full year under the new schemes as the amounts collected by planning authorities will depend on factors such as the size and type of development carried out, the overall level of implementation of planning permissions and the efficiency of planning authorities in collecting the contributions. The year 2005 will be the first year in which all planning permissions granted will be subject to the schemes. Information on levies collected in 2005 will be available to my Department subsequently.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 255 and 271 together.</P>
    <P>On 20 May local authorities were notified of a capital allocation totalling &euro;65 million for expenditure in 2004 on the disabled person&rsquo;s and essential repairs schemes. Each local authority decides the level of funding for schemes in their areas. Local authorities can recoup two-thirds of their expenditure on grants from my Department. They provide the remainder from their resources provided in their annual Estimates.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were advised to notify my Department if their allocation was inadequate or surplus to their requirements. This was done to facilitate the reallocation of funds to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. At 31 May two local authorities wrote to my Department seeking additional funding. Kildare County Council indicated informally that it will also seek an increased allocation. The scope for the reallocation of funds will be kept under ongoing examination in my Department for the rest of the year. All requests for additional funding will be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s waste management policy is set out in the policy documents Changing our Ways 1998, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change 2002 and Taking Stock and Moving Forward 2004. Its approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention-minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</P><Col N="1717"/><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>Local authorities adopted waste management plans that, informed by the performance targets set out in these policy statements, call for the provision of modern integrated waste management services and infrastructure. A decision on the development of a landfill facility is a matter for the relevant planning authority and for the Environmental Protection Agency in the context of applications for planning permission and for a waste licence, respectively. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is precluded under both legal codes from exercising direct control of these processes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The record of monuments and places was established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. It lists 120,000 archaeological sites nationwide, including ring forts. My Department is carrying out an archaeological survey. To date surveys covering nearly half the country have been published.</P>
    <P>Over 11,000 excavation licences were issued under the National Monuments Acts. Most of them are for planning and development cases. It is not feasible to distinguish between them and excavations carried out solely for excavation purposes. A summary of all excavations carried out up to 2001 is available on the website <i>excavations.ie</i>. My Department does not have information on planned excavations until an application for a licence is received.</P>
    <P>Much pressure on archaeological sites emanates from the upsurge in the general economic activity in the past number of years. My Department engages with the development sector to ensure that archaeological issues are front loaded in the development process. Codes of practice for the protection of the archaeological heritage has been agreed with a number of development bodies, including the NRA, Coillte, the ESB National Grid, Bord na M&oacute;na and the Irish Concrete Federation on the mitigation of archaeology. Discussions are ongoing with other bodies to agree further codes. My Department comments on development applications referred to it by planning authorities on the impact, <i>inter alia</i>, on the archaeological heritage and appropriate advice on mitigation is given.</P>
    <P>In the past damage to monuments was caused principally by agricultural activity and the issue is still relevant. Apart from implementing the statutory protection under the Acts, my Department liaises with the farming community to prevent damage. Archaeologists from my Department give talks at courses run by Teagasc. This is only one of many initiatives.</P>
    <P>Overall the rate of destruction of monuments here appears to be low. My Department is developing a formal monitoring programme to measure the impact on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277, 278, 280 and 282 together.</P>
    <P>A risk assessment and risk management process is under way in my Department in line with the Mullarkey report&rsquo;s recommendations. My Department has carried out an initial examination of corporate risks, having regard to the risk categories identified at paragraph 6.31 in the Mullarkey report. The outcome of that process is reflected in the initial implementation plan being prepared for submission to the decentralisation implementation group. ADM has undertaken a similar exercise. Preparation of an implementation plan for Foras na Gaeilge is subject to and awaits the agreement of the North-South Ministerial Council to the proposed decentralisation. Discussions between my Department, its Northern counterpart and Foras na Gaeilge are continuing in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am disposed to publish my Department&rsquo;s initial implementation plan and the plans of agencies under its aegis after they have been furnished to the decentralisation implementation group and to relevant staff interests. I doubt the appropriateness of providing related risk material in my Department&rsquo;s annual report.</P>
    <P>More detailed risk assessment is under way in divisions in my Department. Having regard to the need to avoid aggravating specific risks or impeding mitigation strategies, it is not envisaged that such detailed risk material will be published. <Col N="1723"/>Any FOI request will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.</P>
    <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in my reply to his Question No. 224 on 20 May, I am satisfied that my Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer has carried out the duty set out in the public financial procedures published by the Department of Finance. When policy proposals for expenditure or income are being considered all relevant financial considerations must be taken into account and, where necessary, brought to my attention. Against the background of the work already under way on risk management arising from the Mullarkey report and preparations for decentralisation, my Department will continue to address such requirements.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the reason an oral hearing was not held in an appeal for disability payment for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if an oral hearing will be provided on this matter.</Quest>

	<P>An application for disability allowance by the person concerned was disallowed by the deciding officer on the grounds that his means exceed the statutory limit. The person appealed this decision and an appeals officer made a summary decision disallowing the appeal. Summary decisions may be made where the appeals officer is of the opinion that a case is of such a nature that it can be properly determined without an oral hearing.</P>

	<P>The person concerned has been in receipt of invalidity pension since 5 March 1992. The principal qualifying condition for receipt of invalidity pension is that the claimant must be permanently incapable of work and one of the rules governing the scheme is that they do not engage in work. An exemption from this rule may be obtained where the proposed employment is of rehabilitative nature.</P>
    <P>The person concerned applied for an exemption on 5 March 2004 to engage in part time work as a school bus driver. The exemption application was refused following a review of all the evidence, including medical advice that the <Col N="1725"/>proposed work was inappropriate for the person concerned given the nature of his medical condition. The case was subsequently reviewed by my Department&rsquo;s chief medical adviser who also expressed the opinion that the proposed work was unsuitable for the person concerned in view of his past medical history. Consequently, the exemption application was refused again and the person concerned was notified accordingly on 7 May 2004. On foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s question the case has been reviewed again and the decision to refuse the granting of an exemption to the person concerned has been upheld.</P>

	<P>An application by the person concerned for one parent family payment was refused in March 2003 on the grounds that she had failed to disclose all her means. The Department has no record of an appeal from her in relation to that decision, or of any subsequent re-application by her for payment. If the person concerned wishes to apply for payment now, she should forward a completed application form to the Department and her eligibility will be determined. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286, 287 and 289 to 291, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>Following on the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to decentralisation of my Department, it is the responsibility of the Secretary General and the Department to ensure that this decision is implemented efficiently and in a cost effective manner. A key objective of the decentralisation programme for my Department will be to ensure that the relocation of staff and business areas is implemented in a planned way with minimal disruption to customer service.</P>
    <P>A detailed implementation plan covering all aspects of the programme for my Department and its two agencies involved is currently being finalised and will be submitted to the Decentralisation Implementation Group in the coming week. This plan will include a high level risk analysis will be undertaken over the coming months by each business unit involved in the programme. The audit committee of my Department will review the structures and arrangements in place to identify and deal with the risks associated with decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The undertaking of a risk analysis is a standard aspect of my Department&rsquo;s planning process. It is not my intention to publish the findings or to include details of this analysis in my Department&rsquo;s annual report. However, details will be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General on request and any freedom of <Col N="1727"/>information requests will be dealt with within the freedom of information framework.</P>

	<P>The audit committee in my <Col N="1728"/>Department has monitored the development of the Department&rsquo;s risk management strategy at each meeting held since the Mullarkey report issued and is encouraged by the progress made to date by the Department in this regard. In particular, the committee was pleased to note the appointment of two full-time experienced persons to progress the risk management initiative within the Department. The committee will continue to monitor the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s risk management strategy and will, in the near future, invite the Department&rsquo;s risk management team to give a detailed presentation to the committee. This will be followed by examination and monitoring on an ongoing basis of the issues arising.</P>
