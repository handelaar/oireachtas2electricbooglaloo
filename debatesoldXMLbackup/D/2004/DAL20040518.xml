     <Quest>when the Cabinet committee on social inclusion last met.</Quest>
     <QRef>[13453/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet committee on social inclusion last met on 25 February 2004. This was the tenth meeting of the committee in the past 12 months. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 26 May.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s very short response on such an important issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because he is much more decisive now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kenny for that observation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>If the answer is short, there is something wrong; if it is long, there is something wrong.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not time the work of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs was stepped up? Is the Taoiseach aware that there is growing alarm among people in the community sector and those working with drug addicts that we are facing a disastrous increase in the use of cocaine?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I point out to the Deputy that his question simply asked when the Cabinet committee on social inclusion last met. As the Deputy knows, we cannot have a debate <Col N="1078"/>on what might be discussed at the Cabinet meeting. That is bound by Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that. I asked the Taoiseach that question and now I am demonstrating why there is a need for the committee to step up its work rate and be more proactive. Will the Taoiseach confirm that he is aware that there is growing concern among people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise from this question. I suggest the Deputy submit a question on the matter to the appropriate Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It does arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Not out of this question. The question was specific and clear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the reasons this committee needs to meet on a more frequent and regular basis and become more proactive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We are facing a serious problem. I hope the Taoiseach will acknowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to be out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows he is out of order. This question has arisen a number of times over the years. Anything that might be discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee is ruled out of order. A question should be submitted to the Minister responsible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s strict interpretation of what may be asked, what business did the Cabinet committee on social inclusion discuss when it last met?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it have a commitment to meet again? When will it do so? Will it consider the rise in the use of cocaine? Will it take on board the fact that the Eastern Regional Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to desist from going into detail. The Chair has already ruled on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to you, a Cheann Comhairle, I know you would be as enthusiastic in pulling up the first question here <Col N="1079"/>if it were any other Member of the House. I have no doubt you will apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have consistently ruled on these questions. It is a long-standing rule in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my last attempt to make some breakthrough in regard to the barriers I must contend with. In a previous reply to this question &mdash; I presume that is within the ambit of what is allowed &mdash; the Taoiseach told me there is an interdepartmental group on drugs to co-ordinate the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy through partnership with Departments, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector to bring to the attention of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order. He knows the question he submitted. I call Deputy Sargent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I want confirmation from the Taoiseach &mdash; who responded previously to a similar question &mdash; as to whether he undertook to bring to the Cabinet committee the information before the interdepartmental group. Will he at least advise us if that has been done since we last addressed the issue on this floor?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As there has been a ruling on these questions for several years, I cannot go into details. I am just following the practice. It was ruled that the questions are internal to Government. If the Deputy puts down a question to the relevant Minister on the issues he wishes to raise, he will get a full answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if this is a statistical or diary question. The Taoiseach might include it in his diary for the next meeting and might remind us about the format and when the decision was taken to have the next meeting. Will it be taken into account that the next meeting will be brought forward to a date which will mean the extra &euro;350 million in tax announced by the Department of Finance will be taken into account?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise out of this question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the meeting will take place, on what date will it take place and will the matter be taken into account in formulating that date?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The next meeting will be 26 May.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach explain to the House how it is that official policy in the Chamber is that there is no shortage of money to <Col N="1080"/>underpin social inclusive measures, specifically the drugs programmes?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise out of the question. I have already ruled Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in out of order. The question submitted by both Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Sargent is to ask the Taoiseach when the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion last met. It is a statistical question which demands a statistical answer. There is a long-standing rule that the work of a Cabinet sub-committee is not discussed on the floor of the House arising out of these questions. That has always been the position. I have ruled on it in regard to Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Sargent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It has always been my understanding that a question is framed like this to permit supplementary questions on the substantive issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is a misunderstanding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question to the CSO about the number of cars imported last year or the number of non-national births in the country. It is a question on which, in previous practice, we would have been permitted to ask a supplementary on the substantive issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Deputy. There are two issues here. The first is the question of Cabinet confidentiality. The second issue is that questions appropriate to line Ministers should go to the Minister responsible, not to the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be clear in terms of future practice. I suggest with great respect to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Deputy Sargent &mdash; and it is none of my business &mdash; that they should desist from putting down questions like this in future if the Chair&rsquo;s ruling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter entirely for themselves as long as they are within the Standing Order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that, and I was not asking for your opinion, I was offering my own. Are you telling me that the first two questions can only get an answer such as &ldquo;three&rdquo;, &ldquo;six&rdquo;, &ldquo;five&rdquo;, &ldquo;ten&rdquo;, &ldquo;one&rdquo; or &ldquo;zero&rdquo;? If that is the case, what is the point in putting down questions? I am sure if I had the time &mdash; I do not &mdash; there would be no difficulty in finding precedents whereby one could ask a supplementary question on the substantive issue that is addressed by the Cabinet sub-committee, not what happened at the Cabinet sub-committee or what the Taoiseach said to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, but the substantive issue. With the greatest of respect, I am sure that is true.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1081"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a long-standing rule and we debated this regularly in the House over the years. Cabinet confidentiality which arises out of the Cabinet sub-committee prohibits discussion of the issues. Questions that are more appropriate to a line Minister should go to that Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to hold up the House, but it is a nonsense.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The ceremonies in Dublin and the events which took place around the country to mark enlargement on Saturday, 1 May 2003 are widely recognised as having been a success. It was an enormous honour for the Irish Presidency to welcome our new partners into the European Union. As well as being a key highlight of our Presidency, I am satisfied that we succeeded in making this a day to remember for Europe and all Europeans.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I met my European Council colleagues over dinner in Farmleigh. I also participated in a joint press conference with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, in advance of the enlargement ceremonies on the morning of 1 May. I had the opportunity to have a meeting with the new Spanish Prime Minister, Jos&eacute; Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, on the margins of the dinner in Farmleigh. We had a useful introductory discussion which focused on the Intergovernmental Conference. I also met the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Mr. Anton Rop, in Dublin on Sunday, 2 May. Our discussions focused on bilateral relations, the preparations for the June summit and the Intergovernmental Conference. I will meet Mr. Rop again in Slovenia on 20 May. Earlier on Sunday morning, 2 May, I met Prime Minister Blair to discuss Northern Ireland and European Union issues.</P>
    <P>As President of the European Union, I visited the Czech Republic on 22 April, 2004. I delivered a keynote address on the challenges and opportunities of EU enlargement in the Senate building. I also met Prime Minister Spidla during my visit and our discussions focused on the <Col N="1083"/>Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, and the draft constitutional treaty. In addition, I launched a photographic exhibition for the Czech group Yes to Europe.</P>
    <P>I met Premier Wen of China in Dublin Castle on 11 May. We discussed a range of EU-China and bilateral issues, including trade development, educational co-operation, cultural exchanges, the European arms embargo, human rights, agricultural co-operation and economic and World Trade Organisation matters. The Premier described the great economic and social progress made in China in recent years and his expectations for the years to come. I assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to strong and friendly relations with China and our interest to contribute to and participate in that continuing development to mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, on 5 May, I commenced my tour of European Union capitals in advance of next month&rsquo;s European Council. In the first week, I visited Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Last week, I visited Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In each country, with the exception of Cyprus, I met the Head of State or Government to outline the Presidency&rsquo;s plans for the forthcoming European Council and the IGC. As President Papadopulous of Cyprus was taken ill while I was en route to Nicosia, I met instead Minister Andreas Christou. I subsequently had a telephone conversation with President Papadopoulos. This intensive schedule of visits to all 24 member states will continue over the coming weeks. This week, I will visit the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia en route to the EU-Russia summit.</P>
    <P>Clearly the IGC has been central to all these meetings. I am satisfied that good progress is being made at both Head of State or Government level and at Foreign Minister level.</P>
    <P>I will also attend a number of summit meetings outside Ireland in the period up to the end of June. These include the EU-Russia summit in Russia on 21 May, the EU-Latin American and Caribbean summit in Mexico on 28 and 29 May, the G8 summit in the United States from 8 to 10 June, the EU-Japan summit in Japan on 22 June and the EU-NATO summit in Turkey on 28 and 29 June.</P>
    <P>On 17 and 18 June, I will chair the European Council meeting in Brussels. Although the agenda for this meeting is still in preparation, it is expected to focus on the appointment of a new President of the European Commission, JHA issues, follow-up to the declaration on combating terrorism adopted at the European Council in March and a range of external relations issues. A full Intergovernmental Conference will also be held in Brussels. It is intended to conclude the negotiations on the draft constitutional treaty at the IGC.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the EU-US summit are still under consideration. This will be President <Col N="1084"/>Bush&rsquo;s first official visit to Ireland and it arises in the context of our Presidency of the European Union. While the agenda for the summit has not yet been finalised, it can be expected that our discussions will focus primarily on the EU-US agenda. Other discussion topics have still to be agreed.</P>
    <P>On 21 July, I will travel to Strasbourg to present my report on the Irish Presidency to the European Parliament.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday, the Government circulated proposals to all the EU countries suggesting that the EU member states would continue to nominate one Commissioner until 2014, at which point the number of Commissioners would be reduced to 18, and posts would then rotate so that, in one of every three terms, member states would not have a Commissioner. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether that proposal was discussed with the Heads of Government whom he visited or was it discussed during the round of consultations he undertook following his accession as President?</P>
    <P>The Convention on the Future of Europe had already suggested a different Commission model in which the number of Commissioners remain the same but only half of them would have voting rights. Can I take it that particular proposal has been abandoned entirely? In respect of the proposal circulated last Thursday, will the Taoiseach comment on where it stands currently?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That proposal was discussed at the March meeting when I gave the report to the European Council. I also discussed it last year, in the preparations for the Presidency, with most of the countries, although perhaps not all of them. It has been discussed by the contact group which met two weeks ago. It was discussed again yesterday at the Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting on the Intergovernmental Conference issues, and I have discussed it with individual countries. As the Deputy is aware, it is not agreed yet because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but it has much more consensus.</P>
    <P>The other position would have brought in a system where we would move, almost inevitably, to the larger countries having a full-time Commissioner and other countries having a Commissioner who would have been seen to be of lesser status, not only in terms of voting but also in that there would have been two cores &mdash; the main Commission group and a parliamentary secretary type structure, as is the case in many European countries. I never supported that system and it was against what was in the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>The Irish people voted on two occasions on the Nice treaty but we were voting on a strict equality position where everyone would be treated equally. That is much better because it is inevitable that Europe will expand to 30 countries at least, if not beyond that, and we will never get a position of equal status among 30 <Col N="1085"/>Commissioners at the same level. We may get at least two or three groups but some countries would have liked a small, select inner core, which inevitably would have been the large countries. The Convention proposal was around that arrangement, something the large countries liked but which certainly was not acceptable to the smaller countries. Our effort is to seek something that will remain for a decade, with a Commissioner per member state, and then move to a smaller number on the basis of strict equality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that reply. In respect of agreement on the European constitution, which I hope is concluded, France recently argued that the new treaty could be agreed if more than four-fifths of members ratified it. Does the Taoiseach share that view or has that been reflected to him by his consultation with other leaders?</P>
    <P>I will let the Taoiseach in on a secret, not that I have too many of them. At the meeting of the European People&rsquo;s Party Prime Ministers, which we were privileged to hold before the Taoiseach&rsquo;s accession celebrations, the question of the President of the Commission was raised. A number of names were discussed and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s was not among them. Mr. Juncker ruled himself out completely. Given impending battles in the House, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will remain among us and is not interested in the position? Some elements of the media are referring to President Ahern of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Chinese Prime Minister visited Ireland last week. On a number of occasions in the House, Deputy Gay Mitchell had raised the issue of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. I understood a press conference was to have been called with the Prime Minister, Mr. Wen Jiabao, and the Taoiseach but it was not held. Is there a simple explanation for this or was there a fear that the press conference would be dominated by questions regarding human rights in China?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was getting so much support from the European People&rsquo;s Party I thought Deputy Kenny was my lobbyist. After the EPP meeting Mr. Jean Claude Juncker publicly supported me and I thought Deputy Kenny was his seconder.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not changed my view. A number of names have been mentioned, as Deputy Kenny knows, and it will be difficult to find a resolution on the matter. All the people whose names are seriously in the field are good candidates and the selection will be difficult. The task of managing the 25 countries, the completion of the integration of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, the issue of the western Balkans, the next financial perspectives and the new neighbourhood policy is enormously challenging.</P><Col N="1086"/><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>The new President will also have to uphold the strength of the Commission. I believe strongly, as Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte do, that we should fight for the Commission. I have expressed that view for the past seven years. I have been around longer than many EU leaders and so I argue that issue with particular strength in meetings against some of my good friends in the larger countries. For that one earns some respect.</P>
    <P>For many reasons, political but mainly personal, Europe is not the place for me, whatever else I do. I have admiration for Europe and I like to work there but I have no wish to be there all the time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The French position that we should have 20 Commissioners from the 25 member states comes from a report of the Convention on the Future of Europe. That report proposed that four fifths of the member states would have a Commissioner. I have been opposed to this proposal from the time it was mentioned in the Convention nearly two years ago. It is a dangerous argument. I am glad to see that what was to have been the launch of that proposal by the French and Germans last week did not take place. It was trailed that France and Germany would make this proposal but it did not happen.</P>
    <P>Everyone must be given equal respect and play an equal part. Unanimity is the basis on which we will go forward. Deputy Kenny knows my view on the two-tier arrangement. I am opposed to all those methods. There is a group of integrationists who have an opposing view but I will never agree with them. I have spent years arguing against that system and I am glad it was not launched. I have no doubt the proposal will surface again in some form. These issues return and gain a new life. I was asked about the proposal by many international journalists at a large press conference in Spain last week and I spoke against it.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Chinese Prime Minister, we were to spend approximately 45 minutes dealing with issues. As Members will note from the agenda the meeting went on for at least an hour extra, one of the reasons for which was that we did not have simultaneous translation. I had already spoken to some of the Chinese journalists, who are always glad to deal with human rights issues. The problem was one of time. In fairness, Premier Wen had already had a number of interviews with Irish journalists at home and had agreed to do some others later. I do not believe there was a problem.</P>

<Col N="1087"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want the Taoiseach to misinterpret my remarks. It is not that any of us wishes to see the back of him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition would like if I no longer held this position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On the contrary, the Labour Party would be happy to support him if he were offered the position of President of the European Commission. I am unsure of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position in that regard. Is he putting himself forward for the job or does be believe he will be approached by a broad cross-section of moderate opinion towards the end and brought in as an acceptable compromise? I am not clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply whether he is a candidate?</P>
    <P>What is the position of the Irish Government, in the event of the Taoiseach not being interested, in respect of the retiring President of the European Parliament? I do not wish to make his task in successfully completing the IGC more difficult but does the Taoiseach accept there is a certain amount of apprehension among those who take an interest in European affairs at the notion of Ireland being left for a period without a Commissioner? That issue is one of the fairly straightforward matters raised by people throughout the country. People take pride and comfort from the fact that an Irish Commissioner is President of the European Parliament. There was some surprise regarding the proposals published by the Taoiseach. I repeat I do not raise that issue to make the Taoiseach&rsquo;s task more difficult than it is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s final question first. My honest assessment of the situation &mdash; we are speaking in this regard of ten years into the future &mdash; is that the larger countries would prefer the Convention-type proposal that there should be 30 Commissioners &mdash; it is inevitable we will reach that number in this decade. They would like to establish a small executive-type operation or cabinet structure comprising seven, eight or nine countries who would represent the larger countries, and the remaining countries would receive Commission portfolios down the ranks but would not be centrally involved.</P>
    <P>The smaller countries among the 15 members previously involved in work on the convention and the ten new accession countries have a combination of views in this regard. The view is that it is far better to remain with the Nice arrangement where we have a Commissioner two out of three times on a strict rotation basis. In that way, smaller countries would always be involved and Ireland, when it does not have a Commissioner, would be represented by that group. That is the preferred position and is the one which I, too, prefer. I was always concerned about the other position though its proposed introduction is ten years away. The larger countries want a handy set-up for themselves with <Col N="1088"/>smaller countries on the margins. I believe they are wrong to favour that position because it would result in losing the great concept of <i>acquis communautaire</i>. However, that is what the larger countries would like and we have had to argue strongly against it because if Ireland did not have a Commissioner, we would be represented by like-minded countries.</P>
    <P>It is a better system which will work more effectively. A representative group of the like-minded will always be possible with 18 out of more than 30 countries. The Irish people voted on this issue and, for all the reasons I have mentioned, it is much safer. I understand the view expressed by the Deputy but it is not as it would be now and that is the point.</P>
    <P>The outgoing President of the European Parliament will be in office until 21 July when the new Parliament meets. If Mr. Cox has sufficient support to win the position of President of the Commission, the Irish Government will support him and that is our clear position. I have been asked that question by several countries and I have informed them of the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
    <P>I am honoured by what has been said by Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny. I have been asked by a substantial number of people, although not a majority. I am third in the pecking order although I am one of the senior people on the Council. I appreciate the interest but it is not for me. It is not what I would like to do with my life in the future.</P>

    <P>I understand from what the Taoiseach is saying he is not interested in becoming President of the European Commission and is more interested in domestic politics. Given that he said he would remain here to pester us for a long time, does that mean he is looking forward to being an enthusiastic leader of the Opposition in his new role?</P>

   </Speaker>
<Col N="1089"/>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Irish Presidency is trying to soften the mutual defence clause in the EU Constitution by inserting a clause that it will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states. Is the Taoiseach reluctant to state this clause does not apply to neutral and non-aligned states? Would it not be simpler to do so? The Danish Government has inserted an opt-out clause into the military dimension of the EU. Would that not be the simplest action for Ireland to take?</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposal by the EU Environment Commissioner, Margot Wallstr&ouml;m, what are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on the protocol in the Constitution on sustainable development? Will the Taoiseach and the Government support such a protocol? Was the issue of the status of the Irish language as an official EU language discussed in the bilateral discussions and was any progress made?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question about the Irish language, there have been continuing discussions with the relevant Commissioner and former leader of the British Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Kinnock.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy. The Commissioner has been helpful to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in his efforts to move the issue forward. I will meet the Austrian Government this week and we will discuss that issue.</P>
    <P>On European security and defence, there is no change in the position of last autumn and the agreement still holds. Nobody is opening up that matter. It is anticipated that structured co-operation will be used to develop member states&rsquo; capabilities. Member states are not required to indicate whether they will participate in structured co-operation at the Intergovernmental Conference and decisions regarding participation will only arise at a later stage. The criteria for participation in the area of structured co-operation are set out in the draft protocol, which includes a reference to capability and use at the request of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Throughout the discussions on security and defence in the IGC the Government, with a number of other Governments, has held the position that any new arrangements should be based on openness, inclusivity and accountability. The current proposal on structured co-operation reflects those general principles and can be supported by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The focus on developing capabilities has always been in the context of Petersberg Tasks operations as well as EU support for UN crisis management and we have stuck to that. We have a proven record in peacekeeping crisis management, most recently demonstrated in the Liberia operation. It should be possible to agree arrangements in the EU to facilitate the diversity of the contributions that all partners can bring to this area.</P><Col N="1090"/>
    <P>I do not believe there are difficulties with this proposal. If the EU is to make a contribution internationally, we need to further develop its capabilities for conflict prevention. The proposal has been made in the context of conflict prevention and is based on the Petersberg Tasks. Nothing has changed in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If a proposition regarding the position of President of the European Commission is put to the Taoiseach and he responds positively, I will join colleagues who spoke earlier in wishing him well. Does he not agree, however, that current speculation as to whether he might be offered or would take up this position is a distraction from the real issues, primarily the negotiation of a constitutional treaty?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the content of the treaty is much more important than ensuring finality to the treaty negotiations within the term of the Irish Presidency? Among the drafts reported as being currently under discussion are proposals to extend qualified majority voting to the area of taxation and foreign and security policy. What is the Government&rsquo;s position on these specific areas? Surely the Taoiseach will not support the view that the foreign and taxation policies of this State should be determined by a European Union dominated by the larger members? I ask for clarity on that matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the focus of Deputy Sargent, given that the Government did not put forward an alternative proposal during the Irish Presidency regarding Article 1.40 of the draft constitution, which states that EU defence policy shall not prejudice NATO states and shall be compatible with NATO, why did the Government not seek a specific article explicitly recognising the rights and duties of neutral states in the European Union and the right of those states that require a United Nations mandate for military operations? These are matters of concern to us all and I ask the Taoiseach to give a clear position on them because as matters stand there is an indiscernible gap between the position apparently promoted by the Government and that of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that the social dimension as it has emerged from the Convention will not be watered down in whatever discussions he has instigated? In terms of the various meetings encompassed by Questions Nos. 3 to 17, inclusive, have recent developments in Iraq and their implications been discussed by Heads of Government or is a view crystallising within the EU as to steps it might take in response to these developments?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question. He asked whether I was satisfied with the updating of the Petersberg Tasks provided for in the draft constitution and with the issues <Col N="1091"/>relating to qualified majority voting in security and defence. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because the draft treaty now provides for an updating of the Petersberg Tasks to include areas such as conflict prevention, joint disarmament operations and post conflict stabilisation and this updating is consistent with our approach to European security and defence. It is now written into the constitution. It was not there previously and it is now clearly there that it is on that basis that we will participate in the Petersberg Tasks. That makes life clearer. That is clearly written in as of now, unless it changes, but I hope it does not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I will insist that is not changed because the position now is totally satisfactory. It remains the case that Petersberg Tasks operations will be decided in unanimity by the Council so that one cannot be forced into a position in which one does not want to be. Participation by Ireland or other member states in Petersberg Tasks operations is a matter for sovereign national decision. We have ourselves absolutely protected in the debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s other question on QMV, we have held our position on taxation. Other countries have made arguments on social security and other issues. I agree QMV should be used as much as possible to make decision making efficient, effective and simple but there are areas in which that cannot be done and, in those cases, one must stick to unanimity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On foreign policy and taxation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Taxation, yes, and foreign policy, particularly in regard to common security and defence will be decided by unanimity. We cannot be forced into a position against our will under any of the areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked two questions. I totally agree with him and colleagues have raised the strengthening of social dimension issues. We will defend the position on social dimension so that there will be no diminution in this area or any change in it.</P>
    <P>The Iraq issue comes up in all meetings at every level. All my colleagues hope to see the drafting of a further resolution, which will begin this week, that will allow Kofi Annan&rsquo;s special representative, Mr. Brahimi, to bring in an interim government on 30 June pending elections as early in 2005 as possible. There is doubt about how early. It was to be January 2005 but some people doubt the possibility of doing that.</P>
    <P>The major issue is that practically everyone believes a further UN resolution is needed and it must be absolutely clear on how the jurisdiction will operate from 1 July, particularly the control of policing and all interim arrangements. That <Col N="1092"/>will be difficult but there is a united position not only within Europe but among some of the large blocs on the Security Council. Premier Wen said it last week and I will hear it from Mr. Putin later this week. They all want a resolution that gives absolute control to the UN so that Mr. Brahimi and his administration will be the driving force on this issue.</P>
    <P>If we do not go down that road the difficulties will continue. It will be hard enough to stabilise the process and resolve the associated difficulties even with a UN resolution. If there is to be a new Administration with the vice presidents and an assembly, the combined view is that it will not work unless it is copperfastened by a clear resolution. For the next six weeks the debate will concern that resolution, the drafting of which is to commence this week.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the number of applications for special educational resources with his Department; the timescale for processing these applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14586/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department received more than 8,400 applications for special education resources since February 2003. The batch of approximately 5,000 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 is being considered at present. Priority was given to almost 1,000 cases involving children starting school last September and all those cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications in that batch has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. Those applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nation-wide census of such provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which was issued in September 2003.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing <Col N="1093"/>allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will afford a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is also intended that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this time frame.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister effectively stated in his reply that 7,400 children have not been allocated the resources a psychologist recommended they need because the Department had not a competent system in place to deal with the applications. When did the system change? Previously, if a psychologist made a report it was sent to the Department, after which a box was ticked and resources were granted. Are the 350 posts the Minister announced at Easter in addition to the existing provision? When will an announcement be made on the location of the posts? A number of teachers are concerned about this. If the posts are additional posts, the position might be different. This issue is particularly important given that the schools will close in five weeks. If there is to be a 1:150 ratio, what will happen in smaller schools, particularly rural schools, which currently have a resource teacher for a certain number of students but which will not have an enrolment of 150 students?</P>
    <P>Many of the surveys that have been conducted indicated that more boys than girls have a special need. In some cases the ratio is 2:1 and in others it is 3:1. What will happen in an all-boys school with only 150 pupils? It may have many more students with special needs than an all-girls school with the same number of pupils. Has the Minister considered this?</P>
    <P>What exactly does the Minister mean when he refers to the further consideration of 4,000 applications? Have resources been allocated to the 4,000 applicants? What consideration are they being given?</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1094"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The 4,000 applications are being considered in the context of the assignment of resources to particular schools. They are part of the assessment of what is available and of what is needed in the schools. We hope to be in a position before the end of this school year to allocate resources on that basis.</P>
    <P>The practice in regard to smaller schools is that those schools are clustered for resource teachers. This practice will continue. Discussions are ongoing on this matter and an examination of the various schools and clusters is taking place as part of the exercise. Clusters may change, because of increased enrolment in schools, but the principle of allocating resource teachers to clusters of small schools is being retained.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if the 350 posts are in addition to those already in the system. They are additional posts. The calculation is based on introducing the weighted system and on the resources that are currently in the system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether the weighted system will take into account schools in disadvantaged areas and the fact that more boys than girls have special educational needs. As I said on the last day during Question Time, we are trying to refine the system as much as we possibly can. These issues are being discussed at present.</P>

	<P>I am deeply concerned about the situation in Limerick city at present where a substantial number of pupils, mainly boys from disadvantaged areas of the city, who were refused enrolment in the school of their first choice, are still experiencing difficulty in finding school places. I met community and school representatives in Limerick city in early April and was briefed on the situation.</P>
    <P>There are 15 post-primary schools in the Limerick city area and I am satisfied that there is sufficient capacity overall in these schools to meet the demand arising from pupils leaving primary schools and progressing into second level education. In the 1994-95 school year there were more than 9,000 students enrolled in post-primary schools in Limerick city compared to 7,747 in 2002-03. Clearly, the system as a whole has the capacity to cater for these children.</P>
    <P>The school enrolment policies of post-primary schools are the responsibility of individual school management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in that area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. Where a school is <Col N="1095"/>over-subscribed a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
    <P>Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. The education welfare officer in Limerick has been in contact with the parents of each pupil who was refused a place, has met and advised parents of the appeals mechanisms and has assisted them in compiling appeals where they wished to do so.</P>
    <P>There have been 34 appeals to date against the decisions of some schools in Limerick city to refuse enrolment to applicants for the 2004-05 school year. Thirteen of these appeals have been to the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee regarding schools which operate under that committee. The remainder have been to the Secretary General of my Department. Most of these appeals have been dealt with and my Department is in the process of informing the appellants and the schools of the outcome. Where an appeal has been upheld, the Secretary General of my Department has directed the school to enrol the pupil. Where an appeal has not been upheld the National Educational Welfare Board will assist the parents of those children in finding an alternative school place.</P>
    <P>As well as those appeals still in progress, there remain a number of potential appeals which have not yet been admitted as additional documentation is still awaited. There are also approximately 20 children whose parents have not as yet submitted appeals. While some appeals remain outstanding it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on the individual enrolment policies which are the substantive issues of these appeals.</P>
    <P>Once the remaining section 29 appeals have been completed, I intend to bring together the representatives of all the primary and post-primary schools in Limerick city with other interested parties, including parent and community groups and local representatives, to address the underlying reasons that so many children were refused enrolment in a city which has more than enough school places to accommodate all applicants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will meet the various interested parties. There has been some progress with regard to some of the children since I tabled the question. Does the Minister accept that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that all children under the school leaving age have the opportunity to go to school? Will the Minister ensure some measure is put in place to prevent this happening again in Limerick in future years?</P><Col N="1096"/>
    <P>This is a problem not just in Limerick. Educational apartheid is practised in all cities, whereby children from certain backgrounds go to certain schools and children from less well off backgrounds tend to be excluded from those schools in one way or another. Those schools are operating against the spirit of the Education Act 1998, if not the provisions of the Act. Will the Minister introduce regulations under section 33 of the Education Act to ensure there is equality of access to schools? This is a nationwide problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My responsibility as Minister for Education and Science is to ensure there are sufficient places within catchment boundaries to meet the needs of the pupils in that area. It is a general obligation, not a specific one. The irony of the situation in Limerick is that there are sufficient places to cater for the pupils in the area. The reason I intend to call the groups and individuals in Limerick together when the appeals have been completed is to ensure that this will not recur in the future. That is important. However, I do not have directive powers in this regard. What is required is a certain amount of goodwill and that everybody face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am not commenting on Limerick but, like the Deputy, I do not wish to see educational apartheid in any part of the country. I hope that by working together with the local education interests, local public representatives and so forth we can put in place a system in which everybody will shoulder responsibility and every child will have an equal chance in education, in Limerick city and throughout the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not agree that, at present, schools can hide behind their enrolment policies to exclude certain children?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>When one does not have directive powers and each school is, in many respects, a law unto itself, albeit working within the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can make regulations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I can make regulations but we cannot direct individual schools to take individual pupils except through section 29. However, I agree with the Deputy that this situation should not arise. In certain instances people may want their children to go to certain schools and we cannot facilitate that. I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point, in so far as there are places available, no school should be in a position to refuse people on grounds that are suspect, to say the least. Again, I am not commenting on the situation in Limerick. Regulations will help that and we will endeavour to put them in place. We already have an agreement with the managerial bodies.</P>

   <Qst Pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" ToPid="NoelDempsey" Dept="Education">
     <Qid>34</Qid>
     
     <asker>Mr. Gogarty</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if he plans to review and amend the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 to address issues raised by a person (details supplied) during the course of his hunger strike, as well as by other survivors, including allegations of disparaging remarks made to abuse victims by members of the redress board, the overwhelming secrecy of the board and the manner in which contested awards are being reduced.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14388/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act was enacted on 10 April 2002. It provided for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board to provide a mechanism to make financial awards to victims of abuse to assist them in their recovery and enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives. It also provided an alternative to their having to pursue traumatic civil court cases to obtain compensation for their injuries. Notwithstanding this, the redress bands used by the board in assessing the amount of awards to be offered to applicants are in line with High Court awards made in personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>The redress board published information on its website, <i>www.rirb.ie</i>, on 11 May 2004 which indicates that 57% of cases that were sent to hearing after failure of the settlement process were increased, 29% had the awards reduced and 14% remained the same. The board also points out that settlement talks are considered following a request from the applicant, and the board neither encourages or discourages participation in these talks. An individual has the right to proceed directly to hearing.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy, who was dissatisfied with the outcome of the redress process, agreed to come off his hunger strike and has taken the option of recommencing his case in the courts. The Government has agreed to do everything it possibly can to expedite a hearing and has agreed that the case will proceed on an assessment of damages only basis. While the person referred to by the Deputy was dissatisfied with the outcome of his application to the redress board, the operation of the redress board and review committee must be viewed objectively and adverse judgments regarding the process should not be made on the basis of just one case. To date, a total of 3,540 applications have been made to the redress board and awards have been offered in over 1,000 of these cases. The remaining cases are at various stages of the redress process. This indicates a high level of satisfaction with the operation of the board and the process of redress.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some of the groups who represent survivors of abuse have requested a meeting with officials to discuss issues regarding the operation of the redress board. This will be dealt with in the normal way by officials in my Department. I also understand that officials from the redress board have met group leaders as well <Col N="1098"/>as hosting general meetings where issues raised by the leaders have been discussed and clarified. I am satisfied that this process will continue.</P>
    <P>The legislation setting up the redress board provides that applications coming before it are treated in a confidential manner. This confidentiality is required to protect the identity of applicants and because the redress board, when considering an application, is not permitted to address any issue of fault or negligence arising out of the evidence given in an application and is not empowered to make a finding of fact relating to fault or negligence with regard to evidence submitted with an application. It is my understanding that the redress process is working well and I am anxious to ensure that this continues. In the circumstances, I do not see a requirement to bring forward amendments to legislation which is working to the benefit of the vast majority of survivors.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the concerns raised by various survivors&rsquo; groups be taken into consideration in the forthcoming review? There are concerns, for example, regarding the commitment given by the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, that the awards in the redress process would be commensurate with awards in the High Court. As a result of the secrecy it is difficult to get all the facts and figures but there is a concern among survivors&rsquo; groups that the awards are not commensurate with those in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I put down this question during Mr. Sweeney&rsquo;s hunger strike and I am glad it came to a conclusion because it was getting close to the wire. I give credit to the Minister for coming up with a deal that appears satisfactory to the individual concerned. However, there is a danger that this problem will recur. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view of concerns that a member of the board, who is allegedly being examined for malpractice, is allowed to sit or that there are allegations of prejudice by Judge O&rsquo;Leary against former inmates of the industrial schools? Much of it is hearsay. This is the advantage and disadvantage of the redress board.</P>
    <P>To shed some light on the matter, would it not be better to have something similar to a court where people could report without naming individuals? While I accept we need to address concerns regarding those who might be wrongly accused, and the secrecy and behind the scenes nature of the board is of some benefit in this regard, when survivors feel they are being intimidated, snide comments are being made or their awards are not being taken seriously, there is no scope for examining this thoroughly. The very advantage of the redress system also has underlying disadvantages. Could this review examine how this might be tweaked without necessarily amending the Act?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, Judge Ryan and Judge Laffoy have made reports. The <Col N="1099"/>Attorney General made a report on the process and made various recommendations, many of which are being introduced and will be put into legislation at the appropriate time, depending on what I might call the Christian Brothers&rsquo; case.</P>
    <P>In determining the level of awards, the commission must operate on the basis of the legislation passed by these Houses, which was based on the report of Judge Ryan, then Mr. Ryan, SC. That report recommended awards at a High Court level, which is how the board is operating. It would be wrong to suggest this is not the case. I know some statements were recently made on the radio about this matter and RTE issued a public apology last Saturday to correct some of what was said about Judge Ryan and the board.</P>
    <P>On the question of silence, we may lose sight of the fact that section 28 of the Act exists as much to protect the victims as anybody else. Many victims do not want disclosure of their stories, identities, the fact they went to the redress board or that they received compensation. On the other hand, in certain cases, while I would not say it is wrong or false, it is not provable that those who cited are responsible for certain abuse and, consistent with the Constitution, they also must be protected. Section 28 of the Act exists for those good reasons.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to anticipate a later question which deals with the matter, the manner in which Judge Ryan conducts his business with public hearings etc. will give people the opportunity to say what is on their minds and make their views known, and this is how it should be left. Having introduced the legislation and established the board, we should let it get on with its work. Given that 97% of those to whom offers have been made have accepted them, it must be working reasonably well. As the Deputy knows, it will never be possible to satisfy everybody 100%.</P>

     <asker>Ms Enright</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the standing of the early start programme; if there has been expansion of the service since 1997; his plans for developing and expanding the scheme during the remainder of 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14587/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that high quality early education prior to entry into formal schooling can lead to lasting social benefits that persist throughout life both for the individual and for society. Research also indicates that early childhood education is particularly beneficial for children who are disadvantaged or who have special needs. Parents too can benefit significantly from involvement in early education through improved self-confidence and better relationships with their children.</P><Col N="1100"/>
    <P>The early start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. The aims of the project are to expose young children to an educational programme which enhances their overall development, prevent school failure and offsets the effects of social disadvantage. The approach taken is to establish groups of 15 pupils in existing primary schools in disadvantaged areas with each class being run by a primary school teacher and a qualified child care worker. While the early start curriculum emphasises the development of cognitive and language skills, due regard is also had to personal and social development.</P>
    <P>The early start service has not been expanded since 1995. As part of a detailed review of educational disadvantage programmes, my Department is exploring how early childhood education should best be delivered in the future. I am particularly concerned to ensure that any future actions by my Department in this area are based on a collaborative approach with other Departments involved in the overall early childhood care and education sector. Meeting the overall objective of providing the best possible service to the communities and children involved requires that any educational provision by my Department take account of child care measures under the remit of other Departments.</P>
    <P>The future development of the early start pre-school project is being considered as part of this process and I will make an announcement in this regard as soon as the detailed review of all initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage has been completed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer. At this time two years ago, we were all in count centres. Given that the Government has been in office for two years, when will the review be completed? This programme has operated on a pilot basis since its introduction when we were last in Government ten years ago. No additional school has been opened since then. Only 40 out of 350 disadvantaged schools are able to avail of this scheme. The Minister frequently says that early intervention is important. Unfortunately, the first year of the debate on disadvantage was spent examining third level rather than pre-school level, as should have been the case.</P>
    <P>As a review is under way, it is fortunate for the Minister that what he can say may be limited. Does he believe the scheme should be extended? When will the review be completed? There was mention of integrating this service with the home school liaison service for co-ordination purposes. If this is to go ahead, how will it work? Will the Minister confirm he will give priority to this area, especially given that disadvantage is best tackled by addressing it early?</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1101"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The area of pre-school and early learning will have a priority in the new disadvantage programme we put in place. I agree that the earlier we intervene on behalf of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, the better it is for the children, as proven by some stark facts and figures. The Deputy asked whether I thought the early start programme should be extended. I would not go that far at this stage. However, we need more extensive provision to cater for pre-school children, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and we will try to do this.</P>
    <P>While the attention of many may have been focused on third level issues in my first year in office, that was not the case from my point of view. On more than one occasion I made it clear that the issue of third level was at the end of the queue and, while we had to look after those at that end, the real issue was tackling the problems at pre-school stage and right through primary school. In that I agree with the Deputy.</P>
    <P>A number of reports have been published. We have introduced the centre for early childhood development and education. It is developing a framework for early childhood education, including a quality in education mark. It is developing targeted intervention on a pilot basis for children and many other items I do not want to detail. That work and the White Paper will form the basis for expanding a service to pre-school level.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he did not know if the plan could be expanded. Nobody will establish a pre-school in a disadvantaged area if he or she is supposed to make a living out of it. It will not be possible to make money in those circumstances. Will the disadvantage review consider the age at which children begin primary school and will the Minister give any consideration to changing it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The short answer to that is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. It may be extremely important. Until now, the Department has not been actively engaged in the pre-school area. While there has been a demarcation issue with other Departments, part of our focus will be to try to advance our remit and extend education from birth to 18 years.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the progress which has been made on the HEA report on third level colleges in view of the fact that essential refurbishment and expansion have been postponed pending the outcome of the report.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14584/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While it was originally expected that the review group would report to the Higher Education Authority not later than 31 October 2003, the authority has advised my Department that the task was more complex than expected. The group has completed a great deal <Col N="1102"/>of work and its efforts are at an advanced stage. It is the intention of the group to submit a report to the HEA next month at which time the authority will advise me of its views. I will make decisions on the capital investment programme for the third level sector in the context of the outcome of the review and within the parameters of the capital envelope of funding available to me.</P>
    <P>I considered it prudent to re-evaluate and review the overall status of third level capital projects and establish future priorities. The review was commissioned in the context of considerable demands on the Exchequer for capital financing for higher education projects and the need to set out clearly the priorities and phasing of future investment programmes in this sector. The remit of the review group under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Kelly is to review and prioritise projects mindful of existing building stock and future requirements. Each third level institution has met the group and made a presentation on its institutional strategy, setting capital development proposals in a strategic context.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the report from the HEA in the near future. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to second guess the work of the review group by approving in the interim specific projects a particular institution might raise with my Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must see that the delay in delivering the report has already caused huge difficulties for students and teachers alike. In my constituency, the Institute of Technology Tallaght, which caters for approximately 2,500 students and is the smallest institute of technology in the country, has no campus accommodation, no cr&egrave;che facilities, very poor services and an under-resourced students&rsquo; union. How soon will the report be completed and will it be acted on swiftly once it is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk? Will funding be available under the parameters the Minister outlined?</P>
    <P>The issue of over-crowding at the IT in Tallaght appears to have been put on the long finger. The Department recommends 10 square metres per student, but the figure in Tallaght is currently 6 square metres. By 2007, there will be 3,000 students at the institute. While the Minister waits for the report nothing is happening. While there were recommendations on Tallaght&rsquo;s institute of technology prior to the commissioning of this report two years ago, we are still awaiting results.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I sympathise with the Deputy, I assure him that the case he has made for Tallaght has been made for every other third level institution. Every one has some ten different priorities. The Deputy will appreciate, given the limited resources available, that it can never be easy to make decisions in this area. For that <Col N="1103"/>reason, I decided to try to bring some order to the third level sector. Between 1997 and 2003, the capital expenditure in the third level sector was almost &euro;1 billion. Despite the fact that the review was ongoing in 2003, expenditure in that year amounted to over &euro;69 million. A further &euro;97.5 million has been allocated for 2004 in addition to the &euro;25 million capital funding for the programme of research in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>While expenditure is ongoing, all third level colleges have what they regard as absolutely pressing needs which should be addressed outside the context of the review. If one moves outside that context, one will be back in the scenario we were in when I commissioned the review.</P>
    <P>Regarding the timing of the review, I was initially told the review would be completed by 31 October 2003. I was subsequently told it would be completed by March 2004 and I have now been told it will be ready next month. While I would like to see it completed as quickly as possible, it is more important to get it right than to get it quickly. I hope when I get it, I will get it right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The timescale is key. It is important to know when the programme will be rolled out and whether funding will be available. Does the Minister have a sense of when we will have the programme? I am aware of the circumstances in my locality and I accept that the Minister has different problems. Tallaght&rsquo;s institute of technology, however, has a particular problem of overcrowding. I am unaware of any other college with the same level of under-resourcing. The institute is crying out for investment, but the funding and agreement to go ahead are not forthcoming from the Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Institute of Technology Tallaght, which is the smallest such institute in Ireland, has submitted a list of projects which would cost &euro;71.5 million to complete. The Deputy will be able to imagine from that the level of expenditure required by the approximately 20 institutes of technology. If we do this, we should do it correctly. I hope to have the report soon. Once I have it, I will have to fight for the capital provision to implement it. When the review is completed, I will have a concrete list of prioritised projects across the sector which will make it easier to obtain capital resources.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>his views on the statement of the general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland as reported in a newspaper (details supplied) that grind schools add to the pressure and panic in the run-up to the leaving certificate examinations; his further views on whether in some cases grinds courses can be counterproductive as they are used as an alternative to teaching during the school year rather than as a complement to it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14348/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the comments made by the acting general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland. I share his view that in some cases grinds can be counterproductive when they interfere with normal school teaching and learning and may add to the pressure and panic in the run-up to the leaving certificate examinations. However, I recognise that in certain circumstances, such as a prolonged illness, additional tuition may be useful or necessary for a child. I also recognise that revision courses, whether organised within schools or outside, can help children with their study, if they build upon previous work.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of a broad-based and holistic education for children to develop all aspects of the individual to the greatest possible extent. Education should contribute to the aesthetic, creative, critical, cultural, emotional, intellectual, moral, physical, political, social and spiritual development of children. The institutions referred to are private commercial enterprises. As they do not come under the jurisdiction of my Department, I am not in a position to investigate or regulate their operations. In addition, the right of parents to make choices for their children&rsquo;s education must be respected.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister on the need for students to develop certain skills. However, a student will not earn 500 points or more in the leaving certificate examinations for them. When will the leaving certificate examinations be reformed to test more complex skills than memory and the ability to pass exams? Such reforms would make grinds schools less attractive to parents.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1107"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is responsible for making recommendations on the leaving certificate curriculum and examinations. Over 12 months ago, it instituted a consultation process on the leaving certificate examination which is now being finalised. Aspects of the leaving certificate have been changed and alternatives to the formal leaving certificate have been introduced. I am delighted that the Deputy shares my view on the need for reform to make it more accessible and relevant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that changes in education are never easy. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has identified changes such as continuous assessment, a three year leaving certificate and modularisation of courses. All of these would help to ease the points pressure and make the examination more relevant. The Deputy will agree that a new set of life skills is needed for young people. In that context, it will have to be decided whether six subjects or less should be available for points.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any research been carried out into the amount of money spent by parents on grinds and grind schools? Has the Minister any advice for parents under pressure to do the best for their children in the appalling points system? Is the Minister aware of the terrible pressure it places on students, with some committing suicide? Will the Minister make it a priority to relieve this pressure on students? Additional funding to the work of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, on the Youth Work Act, would give youngsters an alternative to the terrible grind school culture that has developed.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have anything to say about teachers who are underperforming in the classroom? This leads to students being forced to take grinds, which results in high results for those teachers. Is there some way in which these teachers can be assisted in the classroom so that students do not feel they must have grinds?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no idea how much grinds are costing parents or how much the grind school industry is worth. The advice I give to parents and students is that the leaving certificate is not the be all and end all. There are alternative routes to most jobs or courses. I also advise parents not to put undue pressure on young people who are studying for the leaving certificate. There are alternatives available. However, if a parent believes he must drive his child towards obtaining high points there is not much anyone can do about it. We can only encourage people to strike a balance.</P>
    <P>Underperforming teachers are certainly a factor in the number of students who are taking grinds, but not an important factor. The typical students who go to grind schools are not academically challenged, nor are they financially challenged. They generally come from schools <Col N="1108"/>that are regarded as top performers. All this underlines the need for reform of the leaving certificate but also the need for more information from schools about their performances. I look forward to the Deputies&rsquo; support for my attempts to achieve this so that parents can have a real choice. I do not approve of league tables, but the more information schools make available the better it is for parents and teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The leaving certificate examinations begin in two and a half weeks. There is an extraordinary amount of stress on young people. Is there any way the Minister can speed up the process he described, whereby the NCCA must make recommendations and agreement must be obtained among all the partners involved? Something must be done about this quickly so that young people need not go through this any longer. From what the Minister has said, it seems there are a number of years to go before we see any changes. Can the Minister inject a sense of urgency into his attempts to have a leaving certificate that will bring out the best in and provide for the needs of all young people, not just the high achievers and those who can afford grind schools?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have taken every opportunity to advance the cause of reform in education and of the leaving certificate. The Deputy has been present on some of these occasions. I have spoken to the NCCA to try to ensure it arrives at a speedy conclusion of its discussions and issues recommendations. The NCCA works on the basis of consensus so the process is quite slow. That is a disadvantage. Its advantage, however, is that when recommendations are finally made there is a high level of agreement. It would probably be better to have as much consensus as possible in an area as sensitive as this. I will not delay the process unduly &mdash; I will convey the views of the Deputies to the NCCA and try to speed it up.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter to which we referred last week. The Taoiseach claimed that the Provisional IRA could not be persuaded to end its activities without the release of the murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe as part of a final settlement. This position was contradicted last night by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who said this concession would only be considered after all criminal activities had ended. Today the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Gerry Adams, made an allegation that the Taoiseach told him privately, before the Good Friday Agreement was finalised, that these killers would be covered by the early release terms of the Agreement and that &ldquo;there could be no exemptions&rdquo;. At that time, the Taoiseach was giving solemn assurances to the contrary to the family of Jerry McCabe and the public.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the truth of this matter once and for all. Does the Taoiseach confirm or deny that he had a meeting with Mr. Adams at which he said there could be no exemptions and that the killers of Jerry McCabe would be eligible for early release? I have recently been made aware that other participants in the Northern talks were informed before Easter that the release of these murderers was part of the October deal which was derailed at the last minute by Mr. Trimble&rsquo;s decision. Can we put an end to this speculation? Will the Taoiseach come clean and admit that he put this concession to the IRA on the table last October, thus breaching his word to the people and to the McCabe family? Is Mr. Adams telling the truth when he says he had a private meeting with the Taoiseach at which this matter was discussed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt with a number of matters in this area in considerable detail last week and I do not want to go over them again. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met with representatives of the Garda Representative Association for more than two hours last week and he also met with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>
    <P>He has also indicated that he will write to Mrs. McCabe on the matter. I expect he will do so in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have made it clear that the issue of the release of Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s killers can <Col N="1110"/>only be considered in the context of acts of completion in the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, which means ending the conflict once and for all. I said this last week, and I say the same now. I do not think I need to go over what the Minister said last night. I have looked at the text of what he said, which is what I have been saying for months.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>What happened last October?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The process of engagement between the two Governments is continuing. We want to make progress in the coming weeks. We want to clear away as many issues as possible before the summer. The current controversy has brought the issue of paramilitarism clearly into focus. There are other issues, but this is obviously a key question. The two Governments will continue to facilitate and actively encourage the process. We need the parties to continue to engage and commit themselves.</P>
    <P>In regard to last October, as I said last Wednesday, we were prepared, if we achieved the totality of what we were trying to negotiate, to examine and approve a situation where we would release the prisoners. Unfortunately, we never reached that position for a number of reasons. It was not the only issue. There were several issues, including the ending of paramilitarism, &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo; and all the issues around that, which we never got near. I hope that clears up the issue. We were prepared to deal with the issue if we got what we wanted, but we did not get there.</P>
    <P>On what the President of Sinn F&eacute;in said today, it is clear that Mr. Adams is under an enormous misapprehension. The Government made it clear at the time of the Good Friday Agreement that the release of Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s killers was not covered by the Agreement. I said so on several occasions, including in a letter and in subsequent statements in this House and elsewhere. Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness argued that they should be covered, but we argued they should not. At that stage we were not discussing the end of paramilitarism or what would happen in regard to decommissioning. We had negotiated that decommissioning would be finished in two years. These issues should have been completed by 2000. I reiterate that Sinn F&eacute;in argued the position.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the McCabe killers were convicted in February 1999 and we were discussing where we were in April 1998. Whatever discussions took place, we certainly had not reached a position on who would be released. We made it clear from the outset that the Good Friday Agreement would not include this aspect. The matter was raised in this House at the time. I replied by saying I could understand how people in the North would say they were being treated under one rule while people in the South were being treated under another rule. I defended that position, which was clearly our <Col N="1111"/>understanding at the time. What is on the D&aacute;il record is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the arguments this morning between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Mr. Adams. Did this one to one meeting occur between the Taoiseach and Gerry Adams? Did the Taoiseach tell Mr. Adams that there were no exemptions and, therefore, the killers of Detective Garda McCabe would have to be released? When I and thousands of others like me, both North and South, voted for the Good Friday Agreement, we did so on the clear understanding that the Executive had ruled out early release for these prisoners. If the Taoiseach made an agreement with Mr. Adams on a one to one basis, it alters fundamentally the understanding of the Agreement for which people voted. If this is the case, it means that the word of Government given to the McCabe family and to the public has now been breached.</P>
    <P>I note comments today that the McCabe family should trust the Government. If we cannot believe what was said for the past five years on a range of issues, why should we believe it now? Does the Taoiseach deny that Gerry Adams met him and that he told him there were no exemptions to the Good Friday Agreement? Is the Taoiseach saying that Mr. Adams&rsquo;s comment today is false? I use that word because I cannot use another.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to all the questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. We had a substantial number of discussions from September 1997 right through 1998. At no stage was there an agreement that the murderers of Jerry McCabe would be included in the Good Friday Agreement. We are talking about something which happened six years ago. This is why these people are in prison for the past six years. Some of them are in prison eight years next month because we said they will not be released. I recall Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness arguing the prisoners should be released after 22 May, but we refused to do so. This is why they are still in prison. If they were to have been released, they would have been immediately. We held to the line that they were not included in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I have answered the question about last October. Yes, they would have been in the position had we obtained a full agreement last October, or last March for that matter, because the March and October agreements were different. We did not get to that position, which is a fact. To say anyone mentioned releasing them on 10 April 1998, or any period up to that, when they were not fully convicted until February 1999, is impossible.</P>

	<P>The Government promised the judicial conduct and ethics Bill some years ago, and it still has not seen the light of day. Is the Bill imminent? In the climate of current events, will the Taoiseach inform the House of the contents of the letter from Judge Brian Curtin?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to intervene. However, before the Deputy continues, as I indicated on 27 April in regard to the issue surrounding the Circuit Court judge, since this House may ultimately have to adjudicate on the matter, to ensure the interests of the House and natural justice are best protected, Members should refrain from making references which could prejudice the decision of the House in the discharge of its obligation if called upon to do so at a later stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Anything I say, or have said, does not rule out the possibility that a defence will be advanced by the judge that may be deemed a good defence ultimately.</P>
    <P>What are the contents of the letter received by Government and what is the Government&rsquo;s response to the letter? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is on the record as saying that impeachment is a live option. Is that still the disposition of the Government? By what procedure might the Oireachtas have this question examined? I understand that, whereas we have the powers, we do not have the procedures. Given the judgment in the Abbeylara case, how would it be possible to deal with this matter? If the Government is going down that road, I presume it is not proposed to have the 226 Members of the Oireachtas hear the evidence. How can a joint committee be established given that the decision on Abbeylara was that where the findings may adversely reflect on the reputation of a citizen that is not permissible?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the procedures the Government has in mind? Are there any precedents in this matter? Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have any intention to refurbish the legislation on inquiry by committees of the House? Since the Abbeylara judgment, the Minister who in a previous incarnation was well disposed towards inquiry by parliamentary committee in appropriate circumstances has not made any attempt to address the implications of the Abbeylara judgment since then. I would like to know the response of the Cabinet if it considered this matter this morning and what procedures the Taoiseach intends to adopt from here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the judicial conduct Bill are currently being drafted. The House will consider a motion in the context of Article 35.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of this process it is of fundamental importance that those Members who may be called to vote on a resolution for removal must keep an open mind on the issues <Col N="1113"/>that are brought before them. Each Member must make an independent assessment of all matters including such information that may be relied upon by Judge Curtin. As the House is aware from my statement of three weeks ago, a letter was sent by the Secretary to the Government to Judge Curtin. That letter presented an opportunity to the judge to explain and address the apparent circumstances of access to and downloading of child pornography from a website. The purpose of forwarding that letter was to enable Judge Curtin to provide explanations and comment upon these apparent circumstances which were not connected with any exercise of judicial functions in order that the Government would then be in a position to make a fair and objective assessment on whether grounds existed for bringing a resolution for his removal under Article 35.4 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In that initial letter, Judge Curtin was given a period of seven days to reply. He sought a two week extension to reply through a solicitor and the Government acceded to that request. The secretary to the Government received a response from Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors. They asserted that it would not be constitutionally appropriate for him to answer questions asked by or on behalf of the Government or to give an explanation to the Government in circumstances where it is clearly contemplating a process to remove him from office. In fairness to Judge Curtin, his solicitors stated that should the Oireachtas, the body that disposes of resolutions under Article 35.4, make requirements of the judge he will respond appropriately. Judge Curtin has not availed of the opportunity to provide an explanation and commentary to the Government as requested of him on the matters covered in the Government&rsquo;s first letter to him. The letter that granted him a two week extension of time made it clear that such an extension was to enable him to provide a comprehensive response to the Government. The Government had already determined that if a satisfactory response was not received from Judge Curtin, the matter would be referred to in the Oireachtas. The correspondence with Judge Curtin and his solicitor will be available to the Members of this House and the Seanad in due course. I have made it clear that there will be no sweetheart deals. Compensation for loss of office does not apply to the removal of a judge for stated misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>The solemn process provided for in Article 35.4 of the Constitution is of fundamental constitutional importance. Neither the timing of nor the procedures inherent in that process will be dictated by any consideration other than fair procedures. There will be no place in this process for partisan party political interests. I have no doubt that the procedures required to ensure due process will be followed. That is an obligation on this House and on the Seanad and is one that will be pursued in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to Deputy Rabbitte on the deliberations of the Cabinet this morning. A <Col N="1114"/>detailed motion will now be drafted for consideration by this House and the Seanad. It is envisaged that the motion will, among other things, invite the House to resolve to establish a joint committee to investigate, in the light of Article 35.4 of the Constitution matters of public concern regarding the conduct of Judge Curtin. Second, it will require that all steps required be taken to confer powers of compellability provided for by the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997. Third, it will establish that the role of the joint committee will be to receive and record such evidence by way of video, transcripts and exhibits, and transmit it to the Houses of the Oireachtas by way of report for their consideration; that the joint committee will accord all fair procedures and constitutional rights and due process to Judge Curtin; that the report of the joint committee will record the evidence adduced to the committee hearing but will not make findings of fact or make recommendations. Fourth, it will recommend taking measures to ensure due process for Judge Curtin. They will be the steps taken about which Deputy Rabbitte asked. There will also be a consultation with Opposition parties on a proposed motion and any other procedural steps arising from its content. I anticipate that the motion will be placed before the House not later than next Tuesday if we can come to an understanding on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I understand from what the Taoiseach has said that a special joint committee of both Houses will be put in place, but its only purpose will be to receive and record evidence and that it will not make any finding or draw any conclusion and that that report will then be referred to the Houses to take whatever action they consider appropriate? How does the Taoiseach propose to invoke the compellability Act since it expressly exempts judges? Has the Taoiseach received the report from the Director of Public Prosecutions and from the Garda Commissioner? Will those reports be put in evidence to the committee? When the Taoiseach stresses the necessity to observe due process, does that mean that in re Haughey would apply to the actual work of the committee and therefore all parties appearing before the committee would have a right to appear with a battery of lawyers? If that process is held in public, given that reputation may be at stake, it would be likely to go on for a long time. Will the Taoiseach comment on this?</P>
    <P>Article 35.4 is the relevant Article quoted by the Taoiseach and refers to stated misbehaviour. Are there any precedents for the route we may now embark upon? Can the Taoiseach give assurances to the House that the Opposition parties will be given information on the steps it must take? As I understand it, the constitutional power rests with the Oireachtas as distinct from the Government. Will the Attorney General&rsquo;s <Col N="1115"/>advice be available to the spokespersons on justice in terms of the procedure to be followed from here? Will the motion be introduced by the Government? Is it only on foot of that motion that the all-party joint committee can be established? Do I understand from the Taoiseach that will be done as early as next week?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions. Given the constitutional power of the Oireachtas, the Government will make available all information and advice given to us. Over the past three to four weeks the Attorney General has done a substantial amount of work on this and, obviously, as it moves into the area of the constitutional position of the House, we would make our information available and the advice of the Attorney General to meetings or whatever. I assume it would be a Government motion. Others could join in that but, in the preparation of it and to fulfil Article 35.4, the advice we have received is that we should consult on that, and we would do that forthwith.</P>
    <P>There have been precedents for this on two different occasions in the 19th century. The committee would be structured as the Deputy said. It would be a joint committee to investigate, in the light of Article 35.4, the terms of the motion and certain matters of public concern regarding Judge Curtin&rsquo;s conduct. It would draw evidence, as the Deputy said, and then report. It would not draw a conclusion. The conclusion would be a matter for the House. The committee would report on the evidence.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the compellability of the judge, he is not compellable if he wishes not to be, but witnesses to produce the evidence are compellable. The reports to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda Commissioner and the other relevant letters would be made available to the committee along with any other information we have.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether lawyers would be available to the committee under the Haughey procedures, the answer to that is yes. The committee would be <i>in camera</i>. That is what distinguishes it from the other cases to which the Deputy referred. Our advice is not the same as that on Abbeylara but, in so far as there are any similarities, they can be dealt with on that basis.</P>
    <P>We would hope to move as quickly as possible on the consultation. I accept there are legal issues. We spent four weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Would all the work be necessarily in Cabinet?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that is generally the case because it is a gathering of information. There is also a time factor in regard to the point the Deputy made about the delay, but the advice I have received is that it would be <i>in camera</i>. I <Col N="1116"/>believe that answers most of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been stated by the UK chief Government adviser that the greatest threat to global stability is climate change and not global terrorism, as President George W. Bush is in the habit of saying. Does the Taoiseach agree that perhaps the greatest threat to the Irish economy in the medium term is the current record price of oil, which at $41.50 a barrel in New York is the highest level in 21 years and appears set to rise?</P>
    <P>Why does the Government continue to make a name for itself internationally as being responsible for exacerbating climate change on the first count and jeopardising the economy on the second count, given our reliance on oil? Why has the Government allowed Ireland to become the seventh most oil dependent and the most car dependent country in the world? Why has the Government not required, or even incentivised, the installation of renewable energy, particularly with 70,000 houses being built per annum? There is no incentive, VAT reduction, obvious grant or even encouragement for the installation of solar water heating on all the roof space which, in other countries, is seen as a resource for harnessing renewable energy.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach given this matter any serious thought, given that in the area of wind, we have just installed 70 MW in the past three years, giving a total of 214 MW? The Government&rsquo;s modest target of 620 MW to be installed by December 2004 looks unlikely to be achieved. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether that is at least a target which will be achieved in 2004, whether he intends to stand over that commitment or whether it is another series of well-meaning indications that he is supportive of dealing with this dependency on oil when the evidence suggests there is no such commitment and that there is exacerbation of the situation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions. The Government is committed to the Kyoto targets that have been set down and which have worked. I answered questions from Deputy Sargent in the House recently on the national climate change strategy in which I outlined the measures that are included in that to ensure adequate reductions in greenhouse gases are in place to meet the obligations under Kyoto. I restate that. We have been working to put in place the necessary arrangements for participation in emissions trading. That structure is in place.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about renewable energy. Sustainable Energy Ireland has set out its policies and targets and what it is endeavouring to achieve. The Government is funding it to undertake that work. We will soon decide on the total amount of CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> allowances to allocate to large industrial sites and power generation stations under emissions trading.</P><Col N="1117"/>
    <P>I accept Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s point that, because of our growth in the past decade, compilation of the plan has been harder to achieve but, at the same time, we were one of the first countries to submit a plan and we have taken a lead on this position in the European Union. It is not correct to say we have stood back from this. That national allocation plan has been presented to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy said about the increase in the cost of oil is a fact. The reasons for that are well known but that is why we are committed to the issues and policies set out by Sustainable Energy Ireland and towards which we should try to work in the case of renewable energy. We cannot make these changes in a short period, however, particularly when our economy has effectively doubled in a period of more than a decade.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has answered questions I did not ask. We know about the Kyoto Protocol and his statements on that matter. He has repeated them often enough but we still have to see the evidence of compliance. My question was about the price of oil and this country&rsquo;s dependency on that particular resource. The Taoiseach said that the rise in price was a fact, but that is hardly news.</P>
    <P>The question I asked was how that will be dealt with by the Government. Will it simply be accepted as tough luck and that the economy can effectively consume oil to the point of going into recession or is there any clear commitment by the Government about which the Taoiseach can inform us which would, for example in the case of Germany and Denmark, involve much more ambitious targets for renewable energy such as wind, biomass and wave power? Is it not unacceptable that renewables contribute about 1.8% of total energy requirement in Ireland in 2002 whereas Germany and Denmark are dealing with factors of 20% and continue to strive much higher?</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach not ashamed that this country has such a resource and that it could be much less dependent on oil and much more successful in staving off the large fines that are bound to kick in between emissions trading and the Kyoto Protocol? Will he give any indication as to whether he will reduce VAT on solar power in regard to roof space, for example, given that we are building approximately 70,000 houses per annum without any incentive to make use of that roof space? Is there anything tangible the Government can say to reduce our dependency on oil?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was simply accepting the point the Deputy made about the price of oil. As he knows well, there is a premium on renewable energy. It is not just a question of being able to change our targets. It is a substantial premium and that makes it more difficult.</P>

    <P>I have also set out our policy on the Kyoto Protocol and the national climate change strategy. Far from taking a relaxed position, Ireland is the first country to have taken this position and used it in our Presidency. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been to the fore in developing the national allocation plan and we have submitted our plan. I do not accept the claim that we are not taking a lead in this area.</P>

When will the Bill to give legal status to paramedics and allow them to save lives be introduced? It is a simple but essential matter for paramedics in the helicopter emergency medical service.</P>

	<P>An Bille um Shl&aacute;nd&aacute;il Mhuir&iacute; 2004, the Maritime Security Bill 2004, deals with many areas of maritime security including ships and fixed platforms on the continental shelf. It has a wider relevance because it reminds us once again of the major oversight on the part of the Government, many State agencies and the public mind, regarding the importance of maritime security and the potential of the sea. Ireland has not paid sufficient attention to that potential.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been referred to in passing by a number of people. Maritime security has been <Col N="1126"/>compared quite starkly to the type of security used on land and which many Members complain about when referring to Garda numbers and the lack of Garda resources in many rural and urban areas. In my area of north County Dublin the level of Garda manpower is less than it was in 1988, despite the significant increase in population. That is bad enough but the level of maritime security has been compared to having two Garda patrol cars for the whole country. That analogy makes people take notice. Ireland is an island and has paid the sea considerable lip-service. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources did not wish to be called the Department of the Marine when it was first constituted by this Government, but nevertheless it has responsibility for marine matters. It has not provided the level of security required at ports and in Irish waters which should be regarded as a basic requirement for the safety of those who make their living from the sea and those who enjoy maritime leisure activities. Sufficient maritime security is also required to combat crime.</P>
    <P>I am a regular visitor to the ports. I live in Balbriggan which has its own harbour. The constituency of Dublin North has a number of ports including Balbriggan, Skerries, Loughshinny, Rush, Rogerstown, Portrane and Malahide. I have no doubt that in each of those ports, boats arrive from abroad without the knowledge of the Garda and bring in cargoes of contraband goods, such as drugs, arms, explosives or other materials of the kind that have been talked about in this House as requiring control.</P>
    <P>I question whether the passing of this Bill will make any difference to the enforcement of the law regarding illegal imports and exports. This Bill also deals with the issues of maritime safety. It seems the Government has accepted it has no choice but to pass this legislation given that it relates to an agreement made in Rome on 10 March 1988, a protocol for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of fixed platforms and so forth. Will the Minister reassure the House that this legislation is not merely window dressing?</P>
    <P>In my area, harbours such as Balbriggan and Skerries which had been under the guardianship of Dublin Port, are now up for sale. The Minister is aware that the Harbours Act 1996 provides for those harbours to be taken over by the local authority. He is aware there is no provision in that Act for the sale of harbours on the open market yet is happy to allow Dublin Port to do what it likes. I am puzzled by this Government&rsquo;s absolute acceptance that the law does not matter and that the Harbours Act 1996 is not worth the paper it is written on in respect of those provisions. Excuses are offered such as the local authority having a problem with the level of maintenance required or that Dublin Port is not receiving co-operation with the handover. The Government has not brought the bodies involved together and has not suggested a package or a <Col N="1127"/>transfer or handover arrangement. It is adopting a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach by standing back. It seems determined to allow the law to be flouted. I am not confident this legislation will mean anything other than a signature to say that Ireland has signed the international protocol.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any intention of accepting the implications of this legislation? I refer to two exemptions in the legislation which I find strange. Ships laid up in harbour are exempted and do not seem to be regarded as a threat. I know of situations where ships are causing immense security problems such as encouraging anti-social behaviour or are in the way of a navigation channel. It is strange that they are exempted entirely from the Bill. Has the Minister overlooked this issue? If so, is he mindful of the need to introduce amendments to address it?</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that Article 1 of Schedule 1 states that nothing in the convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes. Notwithstanding the immunity of warships as regards discharging munitions, either during a state of war or without malicious intent while taking part in target practice, which commercial ships are not permitted to do, is the Minister aware of the many alleged incidences and reports of submarines snagging nets on trawlers, for which first-hand accounts are available in some cases? Should the legislation not address this matter? If not, how will it be addressed? It is a major issue of maritime security if warships or submarines are plying the same area of the sea as commercial vessels. Providing immunity for such vessels offers no sanction and does not act as an disincentive to irresponsible activity which we know has taken place in the past, in some cases with tragic results.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill appears to be laudable and worthwhile but it seems the Government has decided that it will be no more than a formality. When one considers maritime security in practice, one finds that the Naval Service is stretched and cannot cope with the fisheries protection role required of it and fisheries are being depleted as a result. Trawlers are also using nets and engines much larger than what they were designed to use and many single rigged vessels converted to twin rigged vessels continue to fish much too close to the shore, thus jeopardising and depleting stocks much more sustainably fished by smaller boats. Evidence suggests the Government has decided to look the other way on these matters. For example, due to a loophole in the regulations, razor fish are being caught in an unlicensed manner which will effectively eliminate the potential of the sector.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce a Maritime Security Bill lacks credibility. If the Department and the Government are to have credibility on this matter, they must take the marine environment much more seriously. It always seems strange to me that the impression of Ireland is of a green <Col N="1128"/>island shaped like a teddy bear. In reality, it is a much larger entity because its maritime territory is much larger than its land territory. The Government has a responsibility to ensure not only that maritime security is taken seriously and properly resourced but also that the public representation of Ireland includes its maritime environment. From the point of view of political will, it argues that maritime security is required, while the people who need to support and be convinced of the merits of its argument regard Ireland as a green island surrounded by a small strip of water. They will not be convinced of the need to increase the size of the Naval Service or properly resource our ports and harbours if they do not believe we have a significant interest in the sea. The failure to be mindful of and provide security in the marine environment is not just irresponsible from the point of view of the national interest, it is also dangerous from the point of view of those who make their living from the sea.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Department to take seriously the wearing of life jackets, particularly on leisure craft, while appreciated, is a basic step. Much has been made of the measure and I hope it will save lives but when I see trawlers taking smaller and smaller fish from the sea using smaller nets and trying every possible way to continue to make a living, even though the writing as regards falling fish numbers is on the wall, or perhaps on the water, I question the Government&rsquo;s seriousness about the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate a change in the Government&rsquo;s view of the maritime environment and ensure smaller vessels can continue to fish by introducing and enforcing a regulation requiring larger vessels to stay away from inshore areas. It also needs to restore some credibility following the scandalous circumstances in which the <i>Atlantic Dawn </i>was allowed to pass itself off as an Irish ship and even drew perverse adoration in some quarters for somehow being a marvellous emblem of Irish entrepreneurship when in reality it pillages and over-fishes areas of the sea. As the Committee of Public Accounts has indicated, the episode begs the question as to what return taxpayers received from the considerable amount of their money allocated to that enterprise. This question has still not been answered.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will start to consider the national interest and treat the maritime environment as a national resource and responsibility. It must take maritime security seriously and ensure this Bill does not become a piece of officialdom which is signed into law only to lose credibility because the Government fails to give the marine environment the recognition and protection it needs.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. I am surprised that this legislation which the <Col N="1129"/>Government describes as technical has taken so long to reach the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation 1988 and the protocol to that Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf 1988. Sixteen years has elapsed between the signing of those conventions and the taking of this legislation. That is an unusually long time. I am worried that it takes so long for supposedly unimportant Bills to come before the House. That is not progressive and this issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming impression is that the Government is, yet again, responding to events in New York in September 2001 and in Madrid in March 2004 rather than providing a coherent defence strategy based on intelligence, fact and the needs of the people. The people are vulnerable and they feel the need to enjoy security. We have come a long way in recent years but it is difficult to explain the fear experienced by people as they go about their lives on a daily basis when they do not enjoy security.</P>
    <P>The convention and protocol are among a suite of international instruments against terrorism which member states of the United Nations are enjoined by Security Council Resolution 1373 of 28 September 2001 to implement as soon as possible. The terms of the convention and protocol must be approved by the D&aacute;il pursuant to Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution and the Bill must be enacted before Ireland can be a party to them.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports this legislation. I agree with Deputy Kehoe who last week stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">Fine Gael fully supports this Bill and believes these measures are long overdue. It is important that this Bill is being brought forward as Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union and cannot be seen to be lagging behind its neighbours when it is supposed to be leading them.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Fine Gael abhors the way in which the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s security has been dealt with up to now. Fine Gael advocates an EU defence entity based on five key principles in which Ireland takes a full and active role in terms of its development. The first is adherence to the fundamental principles of the UN. That is important because history will teach us that Ireland should support the UN. The second principle is a commitment to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament and to a solemn undertaking by the EU defence entity not to use either weapon. People living along the east coast live in fear on a daily basis because of the threat posed by Sellafield. What a pity something more genuine has not been done on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The third principle is a commitment to mutual defence and support with specific opt-in provisions for individual states. The fourth is a <Col N="1130"/>commitment to the provision of peacekeeping and peacemaking operations and to the Petersberg Tasks, such as humanitarian aid, search and rescue etc. A significant number of people around the world are starving. Ireland has expanded rapidly and its wealth has increased. We regularly read media reports about people starving throughout the world. However, Ireland has not addressed the issue of humanitarian aid properly. We are descendants of people who gave a great deal to the Third World. Members of religious orders from previous generations travelled all over the world and made their mark. Our generation leaves a great deal to be desired when it comes to humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>The fifth principle is respect for the right of member states to be involved in other military alliances. Our policies are based on the belief that if Ireland does not contribute to the debate on a common EU security and defence policy we cannot complain when a policy is unveiled that addresses the concerns and aspirations of other states, not ours. This is used as a political football by the Government, which wraps itself in the green flag of neutrality at every opportunity, yet caves in on the international stage every time.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Iraqi conflict. My party leader, Deputy Kenny, last year condemned in the House the war in Iraq because of its lack of international legitimacy and pointed out that without such legitimacy a lasting peace might never be found. How right he was. Iraq has slid into chaos and the images from Baghdad and elsewhere become even more shocking, yet the Government has said nothing. There has not been a word from the Taoiseach or a Minister in condemnation of the atrocities that the Government parties did so much to support.</P>
    <P>All of us have seen the deplorable pictures from Iraq which have been published in newspapers in recent weeks. The country is in a sad state. The Government had better learn that to pass security legislation is one thing but to act in the interest of Irish and international security is another. The Bill is important but it is overdue. It makes a joke of our national Parliament that the legislators have been completely bypassed on the issue of the war on terror.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has repeatedly called for the creation of a European coast guard and this issue is pertinent to the debate. Today serious crimes such as drug trafficking and people smuggling are well organised, with the perpetrators using high levels of technology and frequently relying on the disjointedness of national police forces and coast guard services to slip through the net. The amount of drugs entering the country is one of the greatest problems it faces. We read about major drug hauls on a weekly basis in national newspapers.</P>
    <P>Last night I met people in a little village in my constituency, which has a population of a few hundred. The village Garda station used to be staffed by two officers but now it has only one garda on a part-time basis. He travels to the <Col N="1131"/>station one or two days a week. No garda&iacute; are present in the village at weekends to monitor the trouble caused by young people as they leave local hostelries late at night. Elderly people in that community live in fear and they do not know where the drugs the young people take are coming from.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister of State, I represent a rural constituency. The drugs issue is a source of great fear in rural Ireland. No issue is being neglected as much as this. Something desperate needs to be done to tackle this problem, which is causing mayhem in our towns and villages. The Government and the Parliament should be ashamed that nothing is being done about this issue. Families are being hurt throughout the State. I call on the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to tackle this problem, which is affecting the hearts and minds of people in rural Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to a matter of concern regarding the Bill highlighted in the House last week by my colleague, Deputy Morgan. It concerns the possibility that sections of the Bill could be used against those engaged in industrial action or other forms of legitimate protest. This needs to be examined and, if need be, addressed through the form of amendments to the relevant sections. I hope to do this at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The preamble to the convention, to which effect is being given by the Bill, notes that &ldquo;acts of the crew which are subject to normal shipboard discipline are outside the purview of this Convention&rdquo;. I assume from this that those who drew up the convention did not intend that it would be used other than against what we describe as specifically terrorist offences. This should be specifically included in the Bill to ensure it is not used against those who might be engaged in strike action or even an occupation connected with industrial action on board a ship or an offshore oil rig or exploration rig. I would be grateful to the Minister if he provided clarification on this matter before we proceed to the next Stage.</P>
    <P>The scope for the legislation to be used in the manner to which I refer is to be found in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) which states anyone &ldquo;seizing or exercising control over a ship or fixed platform by force or threat of force or any other form of intimidation&rdquo; is guilty of an offence. This is further strengthened in section 2(1)(<i>j</i>) where it is extended to include anyone who would attempt to seize or exercise such control. It is clear that this could be interpreted to include persons engaged in industrial action. There was a recent case in Cork in which a ship&rsquo;s crew found itself in possession of a vessel because it had not been paid. I would be concerned that the ship owner in that case could resort to legislation such as this Bill and claim the men were not involved in a legitimate action but carrying out an act of terrorism. If the Minister cannot assure us that <Col N="1132"/>this is impossible under the Bill, as it stands, we need to amend it accordingly.</P>
    <P>The same applies to those who might be engaged in protest against a ship or marine installation. The Sellafield plant is the obvious case that springs to mind in this context. There have been many protests against the installation and I am sure people would not like to think members of Greenpeace or any of the other groups which have engaged in sea-borne protests against the plant, including legitimate attempts to prevent the transportation of noxious materials, could be arrested and charged with terrorist offences under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives powers to the Garda to arrest without warrant anyone engaged in an offence as defined in section 2. If this is to be interpreted in the manner I suggest it might be, one may again see the spectacle of the Garda being used to end legitimate actions. Many of us will remember previous occasions when this took place during occupations at the Ranks bakery in Dublin and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Whatever the legal position, we must always try to avoid circumstances in which employers are able to resort to the organs of the State to force workers to end a strike or occupation. This would take place if this legislation was framed in a manner such that a ship owner or an offshore exploration company could cite it to invoke the power of the State to intervene against its employees.</P>
    <P>I worked offshore in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While working on the oil rigs in the Porcupine Basin, workers decided to stop working as a mark of respect for each hunger striker who died in that period. We were threatened as a result. Many might not know there are arsenals on board offshore exploration rigs to be used to prevent any type of mutiny. Management and other selected persons are in a position to use these arsenals. This must be borne in mind in this instance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains further dangers. In subsection (3) it provides for the master or other person in charge of a ship or fixed platform to arrest or detain a person whom he or she believes to be committing an offence under section 2. In fact, the person would not even have to have committed the offence but merely have been deemed to have been attempting to do so. This interpretation would have serious implications if it was employed in the course of an industrial dispute where a ship&rsquo;s captain or owner or a foreman on an exploration platform could arrest and confine someone engaged in industrial action or threatening to do so. Clarification is required on this danger and amendments should be made to the Bill, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Circumstances would be made even worse if the ship in question was registered in a state where there were human rights abuses. This would include several of the states that have ratified this convention, including states where even membership of a trade union is illegal and <Col N="1133"/>others in which trade unions are legal but where members are the subject of state repression. In many countries to be active in a trade union movement is effectively to have a death sentence hanging over one&rsquo;s head. What would happen, for example, if the crew of a ship from such a state happened to be involved in a dispute in Irish waters and the ship&rsquo;s owners managed to arrest those involved? Section 5 allows a master of a ship to detain such persons and hand them over to the appropriate authorities of a convention state. Would this state be happy if such a dispute occurred in Irish waters and the persons detained were then transported from Irish waters to be placed in the custody of another convention state in which they might be subjected to human rights abuses, or even worse?</P>
    <P>The same situation might arise where prisoners are being transported to such a state from another jurisdiction through Irish waters and where they mutiny in order to prevent themselves being taken back. That might sound far-fetched but we live in a world &mdash; in a Europe, for that matter &mdash; where atrocities have been and are being perpetrated by states against their own citizens. We need to be very careful before we allow for even the slightest possibility that such states might be able to justify their actions in this regard under international law.</P>
    <P>States and people are rightly concerned about terrorism but we should also be careful not to neglect the need to provide safeguards to ensure the so-called war on terror is not used as an excuse to carry out state terror. No one could justify the awful events that took place in New York on 11 September 2001, or those in Madrid, nor should anyone attempt to justify the awful events taking place at this very moment in Iraq. In recent weeks we have all seen images of prisoners being subjected to terrible treatment. Civilians are being murdered on the streets and human bombs are exploding on a daily basis but these occurrences are altogether separate from the killing of many thousands during the initial phase of the war. This is all being done as part of the so-called war on terror, a war that has absolutely nothing to do with the causes or the perpetrators of the atrocities of 11 September 2001 or what took place in Madrid recently. Therefore, I urge caution in rushing to frame any legislation that is seen to be part of the so-called war on terror without first examining carefully its implications for the protection of rights of both the citizens of this State and those of other jurisdictions who happen to find themselves here, in whatever circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this legislation predates the current US and British offensive but it has clearly been given a renewed impetus by it. Most of the speakers from other parties have clearly placed the Bill in that context. In that light, we should be even more careful to take our time and closely examine all of its implications before we rush to embody in legislation provisions that might have the effects to which I referred.</P><Col N="1134"/>
    <P>I seek clarification on the matters I have raised. If the Minister of State can answer my queries satisfactorily, that is good. If not and there is a possibility that the legislation might be used, for example, against those engaged in industrial action, I propose to address this on Committee Stage with appropriate amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Connolly. The Bill appears to be routine legislation which implements international law to provide for the safety of maritime navigation between the countries which have signed the convention. The origin of the legislation is a UN convention which was signed in Rome in 1988. How the world has changed in the 16 years since then. There are important reasons for implementing this legislation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are only paying lip-service to the essence of the legislation as laid out in Schedule 1. It is important to recall resolution 40/61 which refers to international terrorism and how it can affect the countries that are signatories to the convention. We lack maritime protection in our territorial waters. The Naval Service is incapable of preventing illegal fishing or the flourishing illegal drugs trade. Access to this country is relatively easy where smuggling by sea is concerned. Other speakers have mentioned that this country does not have the coast guard service one would expect in an island nation that has so many ports. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has poor access to navigational waters in this country. I am not even sure if there is a dedicated Garda boat squad or the like. If there is a need for garda&iacute; to gain access to our ports or harbours, I understand they must rely on other boat owners, such as harbour pilot boats, to give them such access.</P>
    <P>Not only should we consider how ships get in and out of our ports and waters, we should also consider some method of tracking the cargo, especially containers, that come into our ports. There are few methods of monitoring what is happening in the ports of this country. This is most important because of the events of 11 September 2001. The success of the terrorists in commandeering aeroplanes and turning them against the public in New York, and the ensuing publicity for the terrorist organisation involved, mean they are always watching out for a new means of carrying out an equally spectacular attack on western culture. Until now, most of their efforts have been directed at the United States of America, but there is no reason for not attempting to attack London or even Dublin, given that our lack of security might make such an effort easier.</P>
    <P>The United States Government has acknowledged that ports are the areas most vulnerable to the next attack. It has increased security around the major US ports, especially those with a great deal of container traffic. I understand officials from the US Government are seeking access to major ports in Europe and Asia where there is busy container traffic between <Col N="1135"/>those ports and those in the United States. The Americans realise that a ship is a perfect means of getting to the centre of a large populated area. The ship could be carrying chemicals or explosives and there is always the threat of what is known as a &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; being detonated. With such a bomb, explosives are used to scatter radioactive material throughout a city centre. The ports and docks of New York city are close to the major populated areas and, if such a bomb were detonated, it would cause devastation in that city.</P>
    <P>The Americans are watching the ships that come into their ports. They are especially wary of ships that come from certain Middle Eastern countries. However, there is nothing to prevent such a ship being organised in the port of another country, especially a country which the United States considers to be friendly and that has few or poor security measures. That is the case in this country. There is little monitoring of what happens in our ports and we are not conscious of the consequences. In much the same way, nobody realised a civilian aircraft could be turned against the public. We should be aware of the importance of this legislation&rsquo;s objective, namely, to prevent international terrorism and to maintain navigational security throughout the world. We should have a role in that regard and face our responsibilities in providing for navigational safety in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of Ringaskiddy. There is a significant level of traffic through that port and, in many cases, the goods being transported are chemicals which are highly flammable and explosive. What level of security is there at that port? Ireland exported &euro;35 billion worth of pharmaceutical products last year. Much of that trade is concentrated around the Cork port area. This is something of which we should be aware and there should be a plan to prevent any form of seaborne attack. Such attacks could happen and the Americans are aware of that, regardless of how well equipped are its navy, coast guard and local police forces. The other issue is co-operation at international level between the different police forces and port authorities. If there is suspicious traffic going through a port or a ship gives rise to suspicion, the port authorities should have a schedule for informing the members of the security forces about it.</P>
    <P>When the convention was drafted 16 years ago, there were no threats to international law such as now exist. Nobody took seriously the threat of a chemical explosion or the detonation of a dirty bomb. That has all changed. Now people in certain parts of the world, such as Chechnya, have access to the necessary chemicals. While they might never be able to produce an atomic bomb, they can certainly produce a highly radioactive dirty bomb which can be transported across the world on board a ship.</P>
    <P>This is a small country but it should have a proper enforcement policy as well as the legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1136"/>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Bill. I hope its implementation will take place with the requisite speed. Since the events of 11 September 2001, the international political scene has utterly changed, with heightened diplomatic tension throughout the world. Just as people can vividly recall where they were when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, others will recall where they were when the aeroplanes struck the twin towers. I remember the assassination of John F. Kennedy because my father was about the same age and I clearly recall thinking it was a young age to die.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I was on a bus when the attack took place on 11 September 2001. I got a call from my son who told me that the aircraft had hit the Twin Towers and that there was mayhem in the city. We felt trapped without a radio on the bus and with no way of communicating. We did not know what was happening outside and felt that everybody was vulnerable. Planes were flying with hours of fuel left. There was enough fuel to fly home and watch television to catch up with what was happening. It brought a new sense of depravity to international terrorism. People now had a new weapon that had never been used before and it made people have second thoughts about flying. It did not matter that the aircraft were full of innocent people and even seemed preferable from the terrorists&rsquo; point of view. The softer and more innocent the target, the more valuable it was to them. The hijackers did not mind sacrificing their lives. In some cases they were duped into getting on the aircraft and did not realise they would also crash into the towers along with their victims.</P>
    <P>This was a defining moment in the terrorism timetable and anti-terrorism co-operation has been a worldwide feature ever since. This is appropriate and we need to tighten our procedures in this regard. The shipping industry is wide open to this type of abuse. There are particular procedures when boarding an aircraft. However, people can simply walk or drive on to a ship. With so much volume transported by ships, that industry is in no way immune from this activity and maritime security has assumed an importance commensurate with maritime safety and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that shipping played any role in the atrocities of 11 September 2001. The bombs may have arrived in ships and the people involved might have arrived as stowaways. Nobody knows how they arrived there. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that shipping could have a central role in a determined terrorist attack. People go on ships in a carefree way. Many people use them to go on holiday etc. in preference to flying and they represent an easy target. Shipping could also be used to transport lethal weapons of war or to act as a weapon itself.</P>
    <P>We recall the Cuban missile crisis of 1963, which brought the world to the brink of the Third World War, and the part played by the fledgling satellite technology in detecting the transport of such missiles by sea.</P><Col N="1137"/>
    <P>The world&rsquo;s maritime transport system comprises more than 46,000 vessels and about 4,000 ports. The system is open and flexible, which makes it vulnerable to terrorist attacks or misuse. The system can be used to conceal weapons or provide logistical support for terrorist organisations. As ship ownership is quite easy to conceal, the system could also serve as a source of funding for terrorists. If a ship&rsquo;s owner were sympathetic to a terrorist organisation, such a ship could become a dangerous weapon. It can be quite difficult to establish ship ownership as they use flags of convenience.</P>
    <P>The spectre of ship hijackings, so often the subject of blockbuster movies, is not quite so fanciful. The International Maritime Organisation, which is the body that co-ordinates maritime activity, has placed maritime security at the head of its agenda, and not before time. Many countries, including Ireland, already have the protection of a dedicated coast guard service for patrolling and protecting their territorial waters. The idea of an EU coast guard on the lines of the international police organisation, Interpol, would play a vital role in combating the twin threats of terrorism and organised crime.</P>
    <P>The recent example of the Madrid bombings vividly reminds us of the canker of global terrorism that continues to corrode the body politic. Willingness of terrorists to sacrifice their lives to achieve their evil aims creates a new dimension for those involved in the prevention of terrorism. Documentary programmes have shown children in schools being brainwashed into believing that if they act as suicide bombers and give their lives for the cause, they will be rewarded in their afterlife. This is grossly wrong and represents an abuse of youth which will need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, Ireland is perceived as part of the western group of states. Last year President George Bush briefly claimed us as part of the coalition in the war on Iraq. I vividly recall that, when I heard that, I thought about the troubles it could bring. This places us in an extremely vulnerable position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the world terrorism threat, and our Government&rsquo;s co-operation with US troop and armament transportation through Shannon Airport undoubtedly copperfastens our place on that hit list. We represent a soft target, which leaves us open to attack.</P>
    <P>The Government played both sides of the road in the war on Iraq by denying it was aiding the US and then saying it was against the war all along. We all remember the 100,000 people who marched against the war on Iraq. I vigorously opposed the US misadventure at the time and, in this House, I indicated to the Government that its dalliance with George Bush and his band of &ldquo;neo-cons&rdquo; would rebound against this country&rsquo;s better interests</P>
    <P>The level of security that will surround the US President for his brief stopover in Clare next month should demonstrate in sharp relief the <Col N="1138"/>puny security that exists here. Our country is hugely vulnerable to attacks, whether from sea or from the air. We have a limited number of naval vessels which do not have the capacity to cover our lengthy coastline. The removal of the search and rescue function from the Air Corps is inexplicable, given the dedicated and unstinting service of Air Corps personnel over the past 40 years. Morale is bound to suffer by the privatisation of this function of the Air Corps, and it shows scant regard for its contribution down the years.</P>
    <P>The 1988 UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the protocol to that convention have been in force since 1992. Specific offences against the safety of Irish ships, other shipping in Irish territorial waters and against fixed platforms on the continental shelf are specified in the Bill. It also provides for extra-territorial jurisdiction covering offences committed outside the State and the extradition of alleged offenders</P>
    <P>Twelve years have elapsed without effective legislation being drawn up and enacted in this jurisdiction and, in the context of the increased threat from global terrorism, this legislation is ten years late. However, it is better late than never. I hope the Bill will be implemented before the end of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. It represents a belated attempt to ensure that our maritime system is free from the threat of terrorism.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to speak on this important Bill. As an island nation, we are vulnerable to whatever threats the sea might bring to us. Those who live by the coast in my area have always been sustained by the sea. In hard times gone by, people survived on it. In the ravages of the Famine, those who lived by the sea had greater chances of survival than those living inland. It is important that we be aware of the sea and what it can do for us and also the threats it poses.</P>
    <P>With modern technology such as the global positioning system, GPS, satellite, the major threat is from drug smuggling. Boats and trawlers can come from any other country and deposit a container in the middle of the ocean, which can be picked up by another person who knows the co-ordinates. We should be aware of how vulnerable we are in one sense. EU membership opened up a whole new vista in terms of exploitation of the sea. Our resources were exploited by others when we did not have the means to make full use of the sea. These are important matters of which we should be mindful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly spoke about the Air Corps, with which I have travelled to the islands on many occasions as a general practitioner, though I rarely get the chance to practice currently. While it is important, the Air Corps service is not a dedicated one. As it takes on average 12.5 hours for an Air Corps helicopter to get a patient to a hospital, the service is not one on which we can depend into the future. We are not providing the <Col N="1139"/>kind of service which is required to save people&rsquo;s lives when speed is of the essence as is the case with children with meningococcal meningitis or accident victims. It is no fault of the Air Corps that its service is not a dedicated one. The equipment its helicopters carry reflects its multi-purpose role and it is not always available when needed. It spends more time bringing Ministers from place to place than on mercy missions.</P>
    <P>We need a dedicated emergency helicopter service like the services available in every other European country. An all-island feasibility study has been carried out. I met the health Ministers in both jurisdictions, Deputy Martin and Bairbre de Brun, who referred me to the North-South emergency care committee. The committee, established under the Good Friday Agreement, recommended that the feasibility study be carried out. I have always believed a service should be provided North and South since the North shares the dubious distinction of being one of the only two areas in Europe which do not provide an essential emergency helicopter service. While both Ministers supported the study, it was overdue on its publication over a week ago, two years after it was commissioned. It was published just before May Day when the Government knew everybody&rsquo;s attention would be on the accession of the ten new states and the media would have no room to note it. It states there is a strong case to be made for a dedicated emergency helicopter service which could be provided at a capital cost of &euro;12 million with running costs of &euro;4 million per year. An inter-hospital transfer service would save lives. I cannot understand the reason we do not have such a service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly spoke about the visit of President Bush. Guarding the President will require the use of six helicopters which will also be used for military missions. The money would be much better spent if it was used to secure one helicopter for inter-hospital transfers. The Air Corps has provided a valuable service but has lost its search and rescue function. The air ambulance service it provides is not the service we require. We require a dedicated emergency hospital service which would operate on an inter-hospital basis in the first instance. It could be provided for &euro;12 million capital outlay which is a pittance compared to the amount of money wasted in other areas. I will not go into the details.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important. It supports the 1988 UN Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms on the Continental Shelf. We are all aware of the terrible circumstances which can arise. On 11 September 2001 people thought that what they were seeing was a movie re-enactment on television. It was unreal. I read recently in the press that the most successful disaster film ever made is &ldquo;The Poseidon Adventure&rdquo;. We have seen how single-hulled tankers can split and how commerce has been put before safety or environmental concerns. Tankers have done <Col N="1140"/>untold damage. If it was provided that all oil transporting ships should have double hulls, it would render unlikely, in the event of an accident, environmental damage of the type we have seen where seabirds along the French coast and beyond were covered in oil. It was completely unnecessary. Somebody should have taken the decision to put the environment before commercial gain. It was said the events of 11 September 2001 could not happen but they did. That is the reason the Bill is so important. We must ensure situations like this do not arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for prosecutions and penalties, including life imprisonment on conviction. It describes what to do when things go wrong, which is very important. We are all aware of what the European Union has done for us. If it was left to us, as an island nation, we would not have the resources to do what needs to be done nowadays. The European Union has had a positive impact in terms of the introduction of essential legislation in areas such as equality, although it is argued that while the legislation has been put in place, there is an absence of real equality or fair play. The Bill is further imported legislation which is considered essential in the modern world. We have responsibilities beyond our borders. When one considers Structural Funds, our real problem has not been the European Union but the dispersal of moneys.</P>
    <P>When we joined the European Union, it was said the small farmer would not survive and that agricultural policies would ensure only large ranchers would thrive. That has been the case. There was a perception that we would be taken over. I remember the prophets of doom speaking about how super-trawlers would take all of our resources. While that has happened to an extent, everybody agrees that, on balance, the European Union has been very good for us. The debate was rerun during the campaigns on the Nice treaty referenda and in discussions about the accession countries. While people have realised that Ireland has done very well, there is a perception that many of our resources have been given away.</P>
    <P>Safety at sea is an important issue about which we must be concerned. There are large tankers off our shores and accidents may happen. Our whole coastline could be destroyed. It is essential that we have the protection provided by the Bill. A terrorist attack took place on an oil rig near Israel which demonstrates what can happen. We have oil rigs off our coast and the potential for disaster is constant. It is important, therefore, to enact laws which provide our citizens with the protection they need to ensure their safety and that of anybody who uses our waters. There is a great responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>This debate extends beyond the issue of safety to the environment and those on the land who have depended during the years on the fishing industry. They deserve to survive too. In my area, which is considered to be the most socio-economically deprived part of Ireland, it is predicted that by the end of this century there <Col N="1141"/>will be nobody left west of a line drawn from Killala to Newport. Every district electoral division has shown a decline except for a blip in St. Brendan&rsquo;s village in Mulranny which has resulted in a population increase.</P>
    <P>There seems to be movement against development in our area in favour of centralisation. For example, the Hollywood and Hanly reports recommended centralisation of radiotherapy services when positive discrimination in favour of rural Ireland was needed. The area I represent will not survive if these moves continue.</P>
    <P>Knock Airport is a wonderful catalyst for change and a wonderful symbol for what is possible in this regard. However, the Government has not delivered in developing it. Instead, the usual excuse is given &mdash; the clampdown on incentive schemes due to EU regulations. It is Government, not EU, rules which are preventing the airport&rsquo;s development. It is in the interests of the Government to achieve balanced regional development. Preservation applies not only to fish species but also to <i>Homo sapiens</i>. If there are no salmon left in our rivers by the end of the century, there will be a public outcry. However, the continued existence of <i>Homo sapiens</i> in Mulranny and along the west coast is threatened.</P>
    <P>On the mid-Atlantic seaboard those most affected by the regulations are drift net fishermen working on larger vessels at sea and draft net fishermen, small operators in the channels and estuaries, usually with large families, who are doing their best to survive. They do not have supertrawlers to hoover up fish from the seabed. Instead, they must count what they have to survive from week to week. The majority would prefer to work rather than sit at home doing nothing. However, during the years their quotas have been gradually reduced &mdash; this year even further &mdash; based on scientific advice to ensure the survival of fish stocks. However, the survival of <i>Homo sapiens</i> must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>A set-aside scheme to conserve stocks was proposed under which fishermen would be compensated for fishing less. The Government stated it would only introduce the proposal if some means to measure the scheme was available. The criteria for measuring the scheme and the means of counting fish stocks in rivers were filled. The scheme was promoted by the Government with private owners of fisheries putting money into it. It was promised to fishermen in 2002, yet it has never been implemented. Will the Minister of State examine it once more?</P>
    <P>Every year fishing quotas have been reduced with no recompense for fishermen who now find themselves in a no-win economic situation. The Government must play ball with them. Already in Mulranny 50 livelihoods have been wiped out. Some salmon quotas have been reduced to as low as 20 per year. How can a fisherman survive on catching 20 salmon per year? Draft net fishing has <Col N="1142"/>continued in Mulranny for hundreds of years but is now lost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent legislation requiring the compulsory wearing of lifejackets at sea. However, who will implement the law? Sea angling is an important economic and social activity in coastal areas with many local clubs in existence. However, this year there was no angling in Mulranny because safety regulations had changed so much that many boats were simply not available. Sea angling competitions were successful in involving whole families and the community, yet we have seen their demise in Mulranny, Belmullet and other coastal towns.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of maritime safety, particularly given last year&rsquo;s tragic incident off the south-east coast. However, cognisance must be taken of the reality on the ground. I am in favour of safety at sea. In this context, the law on lifejackets should have been introduced many years before. However, it would have been better if the regulations had been phased in rather than using the overkill method in the recent Bill. Sea angling, on which many are dependent, provides a spin-off for the tourism industry. Now, however, many of them cannot afford to provide all of the required safety gear or upgrade to larger vessels.</P>
    <P>Though I welcome the Bill for the public good, a balance is required to be struck. The survival of those living along the west coast must be ensured.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their support of the Bill and look forward to their assistance in ensuring its early passage. Its enactment and D&aacute;il approval of the necessary motions under Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution to approve the terms of the 1988 convention and its protocol are the essential first steps to enable Ireland to formally accede to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and its protocol. Ireland&rsquo;s accession cannot take effect until 90 days after the instrument of accession is deposited with the Secretary General of the UN International Maritime Organisation in London. However, early passage of the Bill will reassure our important commercial shipping and port enterprises and offshore energy producers. It also confirms the Government&rsquo;s resolve to deal effectively with the terrorism dossier during our EU Presidency. Deputies will have an opportunity to raise issues during the Estimates debate tomorrow and with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Morgan and Ferris asked if the Bill could be used in cases involving industrial action or a protest against states or businesses. Advice has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General on these points, to which we will return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the protection of shipping and offshore platforms against damage or destruction and injury to persons on board. It <Col N="1143"/>targets unlawful, that is, disproportionate and unjustifiable, actions against human life and property such as ships and offshore platforms. The 1988 convention and protocol are being reviewed at the IMO with a view to improvement. Therefore, some changes may come about.</P>
    <P>A number of general points were raised. Maritime security is an ongoing issue, as is maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. We must address these issues as best we can. Legislation is an element of the required response and security and safety awareness needs to be uppermost in the minds of all users of the sea, whether businesses or individuals. The Bill ensures offenders can be prosecuted and punished in the State wherever they commit the offences.</P>
    <P>Sea fishery issues were raised by a number of Deputies. Deputy Sargent commented on the unacceptable practices that were depleting stocks of razor clams and fish near the shore. I have noted his comments and my Department can consider what is to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville asked about the Shannon Foynes Port Company and trans-shipment. Given the small size of the country, the question of developing port facilities at Shannon Foynes Port and others must be carefully considered in the national context. This calls for a realistic assessment to be made of business needs and opportunities to avoid wasteful investments. I look forward to the active development by port companies of links with customers and potential customers in order to maximise profitable business in the longer term for publicly owned assets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan requested information on whether the USA was one of the 78 countries that were party to the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation. The USA has been a party to the convention since 6 March 1995 and is also one of the 71 countries that are party to the 1988 protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. I will send further information on all states involved in the convention to the Deputy within the next few days.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the port facility plans in respect of eight facilities at Dublin Port. Any concerns of stevedores or other port users should be addressed to the Dublin Port Company without delay. The Department is not aware of concerns raised by stevedores as outlined by the Deputy but if he gives us the details, we will investigate the matter. These plans will be thoroughly examined on receipt and all of the facilities in question will be visited by representatives of the Department.</P><Col N="1144"/>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of the absence of harbour masters at some ports. A recruitment competition to fill the vacant posts at Howth, Dunmore East and Castletownbere will take place in the near future. The filling of these posts had been delayed pending the settlement of terms and conditions by the Department of Finance. Interviews will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney asked whether the Bill had any adverse implications for the Lough Foyle Ferry Company which operates a ferry service between Greencastle, County Donegal, and Magilligan, County Derry. The answer is no. On the contrary, it ensures a terrorist attack on the service would be a criminal offence subject to prosecution and severe punishment.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the Bill is aimed at safeguarding human life and protecting shipping and offshore platforms. I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their support for it. I hope it will pass through its final Stages in the next few weeks. I thank Mr. Tobin for preparing it and working beyond the call of duty in ensuring it will be passed through the House as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P LI="1" el="5">Bill entitled an Act to provide for the punishment by courts in the State and by courts-martial of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other offences within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which was established under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, done at Rome on 17 July 1998; to enable effect to be given to requests by that Court for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of those offences, including requests to arrest and surrender persons, to freeze assets and to enforce any fines or forfeitures imposed by it; to make provision in relation to any sittings of the Court that may be held in the State; and to provide for related matters.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect in Irish law to the provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on 17 July 1998, otherwise known as the Rome statute. The Bill creates domestic offences and associated penalties for ICC crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It enables assistance to be given to the International Criminal Court by permitting the arrest and surrender of persons requested by the court. It also provides for the freezing of assets and enforcement of ICC orders for fines or forfeiture of such assets to the court and other forms of practical assistance in the investigation of ICC offences. It also provides for sittings of the court in the State and related technical matters.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that the Bill was preceded by a constitutional amendment which was approved by a majority of voters in a referendum held in June 2001. The amendment was enacted in 2002. It ensures the State&rsquo;s constitutional obligations will not conflict with the fulfilment of its obligations under the Rome statute, since submission to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court necessitates a partial transfer to it of the sovereign power of the State to administer criminal justice.</P>
    <P>Before going into the detail of the Bill, it is worth recalling the savage and brutal events that led to the creation of such an international court. Conflict among nations has resulted in great loss of human life and the destruction that prevails during such conflict. In an attempt to afford justice to the victims of this devastation <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals have been established to ensure legal responsibility is not least where power is greatest. The trials of the last decades &mdash; Nuremberg, Tokyo, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda &mdash; are testament to the efforts to stop these violations of international human rights and protect the most innocent and vulnerable victims of such attacks. The International Criminal Court is a new departure in this struggle. Unlike previous tribunals, it is the first court to be established on a permanent international basis and will be the first to be in existence before a conflict breaks out. This permanency should ensure a proactive rather than reactive response to such atrocities in the future.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the recent tribunals to deal with massive human rights violations in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia revived the international momentum for establishing a permanent, independent, international criminal court. However, the road to the conclusion of the Rome statute began many decades ago and the journey since has been long and difficult. While we are all familiar with international civil courts and international civil jurisdictions, national criminal courts have been ferociously protective <Col N="1146"/>of their jurisdictions. More so than any other court, the work of national criminal courts is a fundamental expression of sovereign democracy.</P>
    <P>In a world without any history or knowledge of such international courts the task of the founding fathers challenged the very foundations of national criminal courts. The compromise framework achieved which broke this mould and paved the way for the establishment of the International Criminal Court created an international court which was independent but also dependent on the Executives of the various jurisdictions which it represents for its functioning. As a result, the court is independent in the exercise of its functions but at the same time dependent on assistance from state parties in bringing perpetrators of ICC crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>The journey to this compromise and the establishment of the International Criminal Court commenced in 1948 at the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on foot of a request from the UN General Assembly for the establishment of an international court. At that time the International Law Commission was given the task of considering the establishment of an international criminal court. The following year the 1949 Geneva Conventions were agreed, thus establishing grave breaches as offences against international law. These conventions developed the scope of genocide as a crime against humanity and extended international responsibility into situations of international conflict. During the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, crimes against humanity were linked to armed conflict. The recent tribunals dealing with the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have now established these crimes as self-standing, to be prosecuted even in the absence of armed conflict.</P>
    <P>The conventions of 1948 and 1949 were to be the last such instruments for many years as the United Nations development of international criminal law concentrated on narcotics and terrorism. The establishment of the recent tribunals showed what could be achieved but the difficulties in establishing an international court remained. These difficulties were recognised in one of the early cases to be considered by the Yugoslav tribunal &mdash; the Tadic case. That case highlighted the difficulties in creating an independent, impartial, international criminal court to be established by law rather than by the United Nations Security Council as was the case with the tribunals.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period between the International Law Commission&rsquo;s original mandate in 1948 and the establishment of the tribunals several draft texts were produced by the commission. During this period, aside from the individual tribunals, there have been many instances of crimes against humanity and war crimes for which no individuals have been held accountable. Even where tribunals have been established to deal with specific crimes, the delays inherent in setting up such tribunals have several <Col N="1147"/>consequences in terms of crucial evidence being destroyed, perpetrators escaping or disappearing and witnesses relocating or being intimidated. Thus, there was a continuing need for an international criminal court with individual responsibility as an enforcement mechanism in the fight against such international atrocities.</P>
    <P>The work of the International Law Commission culminated in a text finalised at a meeting of the international community in Rome in July 1998. The International Criminal Court entered into force on 1 July 2002 when 60 states had ratified the statute. To date, 94 states have become party to the statute. Its implementation is supported by the rules of procedure and evidence and elements of crime. Although subordinate to the statute, these instruments provide respectively for the procedural framework for the application of the statute and further elaborations of the definitions of the main ICC offences.</P>
    <P>The court which has its seat in The Hague is composed of four organs: the Presidency consisting of a president and two vice-presidents who are responsible for the administration of the court; the divisions or chambers of the court comprising pre-trial, trial and appeal divisions; the independent office of the prosecutor and the registry with responsibility for non-judicial administration of the court. An Irish judge at the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Ms Maureen Harding Clark, has been elected as one of the 18 judges of the court. At subsequent meetings of the state parties the prosecutor, deputy prosecutor and registrar of the court were elected. Since their appointment, the various organs of the court have each been active in recruiting staff, drafting regulations and formulating policies to inform their work in readiness for the court&rsquo;s first cases.</P>
    <P>The court is already operational in that it has received its first two referrals from state parties. The first relates to an incident in northern Uganda while the second is from the Democratic Republic of Congo concerning an alleged incident in Ituri. The prosecutor is considering whether to initiate formal investigations which, in turn, could lead to the court&rsquo;s first case.</P>
    <P>The statute does more than establish a permanent court. It represents a tapestry of negotiation and compromise between the state parties. To undo any element is to risk unravelling many other principles. The first key difference between the International Criminal Court and the preceding tribunals is that, potentially, the jurisdiction of the court applies to all state parties. Unlike the previous tribunals which were established by the victors and directed at the losers of conflict, all state parties are potential defendants before the court.</P>

   </Speaker>
<Col N="1148"/>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The International Criminal Court brings a new sense of individual criminal responsibility to international crimes. Its jurisdiction extends to offences committed by nationals of state parties, or committed on the territory of state parties and non-state parties which have consented to the court having a role. This individual responsibility is extended to ensure any diplomatic immunity attaching to a person because of a connection with a state party is not a bar to proceedings. The court will also have jurisdiction over crimes committed in situations anywhere in the world referred to it by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes, the court may also prosecute those in authority who order crimes to be committed, including Heads of State and government officials. This formulation should ensure those holding state positions who orchestrate such attacks on humanity cannot hide behind their office so as to evade prosecution.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 60, respectively, implement this criminal responsibility. Apart from these specific International Criminal Court provisions, the Irish courts may apply domestic criminal law principles when considering ICC offences. Under section 3, the courts may also take into account the rules of procedure and evidence, the elements of crime and any relevant judgment or decision of the International Criminal Court, together with the preparatory background work in drafting the statute and the published views of commentators on the operation of the statute.</P>
    <P>Individual criminal responsibility is grounded on the principle of complementarity of the Rome statute. The International Criminal Court is not a substitute for national criminal justice systems in that it will only take on an investigation where a state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution. As such, it is an institution to encourage states to prosecute such international crimes rather than seek to diminish states&rsquo; domestic judicial authority.</P>
    <P>Under Article 14 of the statute, any state party can refer a crime to the prosecutor and no state party has a veto over prosecution. However, it is more than just a court for the virtuous, since as previously noted, the International Criminal Court may consider offences wherever committed, if referred by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <P>A specific domestic legislative provision is not required to give effect to this principle of complementarity. It is, however, enshrined in the preamble to the statute which also recognises that it is the duty of every state to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for these grave crimes which threaten the peace, security and well-being of the international community. The principle of complementarity is reinforced in Article 17 which declares that a case being investigated or prosecuted by a state shall not be considered by the court unless the state is <Col N="1149"/>unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution.</P>
    <P>In terms of the jurisdiction to be taken by state parties, the statute requires that state parties provide jurisdiction for crimes committed on the territory of the state, or by a national of the state outside the state. A further category of jurisdiction &mdash; universal jurisdiction &mdash; whereby jurisdiction is adopted over any offence committed in any state by a person of any nationality, was previously adopted in the Geneva Conventions Acts 1962 and 1998 in respect of grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions of 1977. As many of these grave breaches are comparable with ICC offences, universal jurisdiction is also adopted in section 12 for those ICC offences which are also grave breaches. It is a matter for Irish courts to decide, depending on the facts of the particular case, whether the ICC offence is comparable with a grave breach for the purposes of exercising such universal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The creation of a permanent independent prosecutor who can investigate and prosecute ICC offences is yet another strength of the International Criminal Court as compared with previous tribunals. This is of critical importance in cases where democracy has broken down and state institutions may not be available to undertake such investigations. In such instances the prosecutor may, with the permission of the state, personally conduct investigations in the state in accordance with Part 9 of the statute. If the authority of the state is not forthcoming, the prosecutor may still conduct an investigation. In this case the statute requires the authorisation of the pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court that the state is clearly unable to execute a request for co-operation due to the unavailability of any authority or any component of its judicial system competent to execute the request for co-operation. Section 58 of the Bill implements this provision in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>While such stringent measures are necessary in the prosecution of these crimes, the tapestry of the statute is interlaced with equally demanding safeguards to protect the rights of the accused and also to reflect state parties&rsquo; genuine concerns for their sovereignty. This is reflected in the Bill in that, although the Irish High Court, in considering a request for surrender, may not review the grounds supporting the request as authorised by the pre-trial chamber, there is the possibility of admissibility and jurisdictional challenges, and these are interwoven into the Bill.</P>
    <P>At each stage in the arrest and surrender process established in Part 3 of the Bill, there is a brake on proceedings to allow for the possibility of admissibility challenges before the International Criminal Court. Thus the Minister may postpone the certification of a request for surrender in section 18 until any challenge to the admissibility of the case or to the ICC&rsquo;s jurisdiction is determined. Similarly, the High <Col N="1150"/>Court will not make a surrender order under section 24 if there are challenges to admissibility. Additionally, section 26 ensures that a person who has been committed under a surrender order may not be surrendered until 15 days after the order has been made or alternatively until all appeal proceedings have been determined. Even after the High Court has made the surrender order, the Minister under section 30 may still postpone the surrender pending the conclusion of any admissibility challenges.</P>
    <P>The statute also recognises the rights of the individual by specifying a schedule of entitlements in Article 55, typical of the standards expected in an Irish criminal prosecution. These rights include, <i>inter alia</i>, the right not to confess guilt, the right not to incriminate oneself, the right to an interpreter, and the right not to be subject to arbitrary arrest. In addition, where there are grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the person is about to be questioned by either the prosecutor, the Irish courts or the Garda, the person is entitled to be informed that there are grounds to believe that he or she has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The person also has the right to remain silent, the right to have legal assistance and the right to be questioned in the presence of counsel unless the person has voluntarily waived this right.</P>
    <P>The statute also places particular emphasis on guaranteeing the interests of victims of crimes which are the subject of ICC proceedings. This complement of rights creates obligations throughout the Bill and, rather than list these at this point, I will make appropriate references to these rights as I elaborate on individual provisions in the Bill. The rights of persons coming before the Irish courts in connection with a domestic prosecution of an International Criminal Court offence are similar to domestic rights during any criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>The rights of individuals appearing before the ICC are further protected by the court&rsquo;s administration. Before the prosecutor proceeds with an investigation, the pre-trial chamber of the court must be satisfied that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC and that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure the person&rsquo;s appearance at trial. The pre-trial chamber must also be satisfied that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure he or she does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or court proceedings, and to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime which is within the jurisdiction of the court. Thus the individual&rsquo;s rights are protected by the pre-trial chamber before trial and by the International Criminal Court during trial.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in six Parts and has three Schedules. Part 1 lays down preliminary matters for co-operation with the ICC and for the hearing of ICC offences by Irish courts. It defines key terms <Col N="1151"/>and makes general provisions regarding interpretation by Irish courts of the Act and the statute. This Part also deals generally with requests from the International Criminal Court, including the procedures to be followed where the disclosure of information might be prejudicial to the security interests of the State. Expenses incurred in the administration of the Act are also provided for in this Part.</P>
    <P>In terms of effect on Irish criminal law, Part 2 has the greatest impact as it establishes domestic jurisdiction for ICC offences. The existing offence of genocide is consolidated in section 7, while in section 6, existing definitions of war crimes under the Geneva Convention are expanded and a new offence of crimes against humanity is created. Ancillary offences are created in section 8 while new offences against the administration of justice either before the ICC or before an Irish court considering an ICC offence are created in section 11. Sections 9 and 10 require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before initiating these proceedings, while the gravity of these crimes is reflected in their applicable sentences which correspond to the penalties in the Rome Statute, that is to say, life for murder or where the seriousness of the offence justifies same and, in all other circumstances, imprisonment for up to 30 years depending on the nature of the offence. The courts may also order a fine or forfeiture in accordance with Article 77 of the statute. In such instances, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is triggered to facilitate enforcement of the orders.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with requests for arrest and surrender of persons to the ICC in connection with the investigation, prosecution of an ICC offence or, alternatively, surrender to a state of enforcement for the enforcement of an ICC sentence. This Part implements the requirement in Article 91(2)(<i>c</i>) of the statute that the requirements are not more burdensome than those applicable to extradition requests in treaties to which the State is a party. This Part is informed on the basis that it is a matter for the ICC and not either the Minister or the High Court to question the validity or authorisation of a warrant. The Minister may seek further information in support of a request and the High Court may consider the execution of the warrant of arrest and whether the rights of the individual have been respected during the arrest. Any matters concerning whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued are to be considered by the ICC, and Article 59 of the statute provides accordingly. If the request conflicts in any way with the State&rsquo;s obligations under diplomatic immunity, it is presumed that it is a matter for the ICC to resolve these issues under Article 98 of the statute in advance of making the request.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 to 19 establish the basis for receipt of an ICC request for the arrest and surrender of the requested person. The arrangements are similar to those under the International War <Col N="1152"/>Crimes Tribunals Act 1998 in that once a request is received and certified by the Minister to be in order, a warrant of arrest is issued by the High Court. That court is the relevant one in so far as this Part is concerned because of the serious nature of the crimes within the remit of the ICC. This should not result in any significant increase in the work of the High Court as it is not expected that there will be a large volume of cases under this legislation. It is also appropriate that these requests are considered by a superior court because the ICC may request the surrender of a person who has not yet been charged with, much less prosecuted or convicted of, a crime. There are also safeguards from an ICC perspective in that the prosecutor must satisfy the pre-trial chamber of the ICC that there are &ldquo;reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other significant difference from domestic criminal investigation and prosecution is that, in urgent cases, a person may be detained on a provisional arrest warrant issued by the High Court for up to 60 days, as required by the statute, pending the receipt of a formal request from the ICC. While provisional arrest warrants are not unusual in extradition proceedings, this detention period is in contrast to a maximum detention of 18 days in extradition cases. Section 17 provides for a situation where there is an extradition request competing with the ICC request. If the competing request is received from another state or from a third state where no international obligation exists to comply with the request, the Bill gives priority to the ICC request. Where there is an international obligation to consider, the Bill lists the factors to be taken into account before any decision is reached. These factors include the dates the respective requests were received, the nationality of the requested persons, the territory of the offence and the possibility of subsequent surrender between the ICC and the requesting state. In terms of extradition within the EU, section 30(3) of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 provides for priority to be given to the ICC requests over EU requests.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Once arrested, sections 20 to 26 require that a person be shown a copy of a warrant of arrest either at the time of arrest or within 24 hours of arrest and also require that the person be brought immediately before the High Court. The court, on being satisfied that there are no outstanding issues of admissibility, may make an order for surrender to take place not earlier than 15 days after the making of the order.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1155"/>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion, which is in the names of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Green Party, was designed to unite, not divide, this House. I regret that in its lengthy amendment the Government has chosen to reject the central premise of the motion, that of the convening of a disability summit on publication of the disability Bill. Such a summit would allow for the examination of the Government&rsquo;s plans to allow for the progressive realisation of rights to services, which is long overdue. If the Government had been willing, it would have shown good faith. It would have proved to people with disabilities and their families that the Government was willing to engage in partnership with them in a genuine attempt to reach an equitable solution. The Government talks a good deal about the Opposition bringing forward constructive suggestions, but the Opposition has come together to put forward constructive suggestions in good faith.</P>
    <P>It is deeply disappointing that the Government has resorted to listing its achievements in a self-congratulatory manner rather than addressing what needs to be done to ensure equal citizenship rights for people with disabilities. The &ldquo;Look at all we&rsquo;ve done for you&rdquo; tone comes through loud and clear. It is patronising.</P>
    <P>In the past 40 years, men have walked on the moon, we have sent robots to the surface of Mars, we have seen the end of apartheid, the demolition of the Berlin Wall, the explosion of the information age with the Internet and huge strides in medical science, nanotechnology and so on. Ireland is at the cutting edge of this technology and it has taken its place proudly among the nations of the earth. As the country holding the EU Presidency, we recently welcomed an additional ten countries to the Union. The people of Ireland have created the economic miracle of a stable economy, high growth rates, massive Exchequer surpluses and record employment levels. We have achieved much and have been encouraged to celebrate. In the context of those national and international achievements we have every reason to be ashamed of the fact that in the middle of the fourth year of the 21st century we are still debating ways to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We have no reason to be proud that one in every ten citizens in our country does not enjoy the same rights as the other nine. We should be thoroughly ashamed that in prosperous Ireland, the envy of the EU, television programmes such as the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary show the stark reality of the lack of basic services for children with intellectual disability and the lack of respite care and other supports for their families. It should be to our eternal shame that in 21st century Ireland, people like Charlie and Ann Cooley can only contemplate death for themselves and their intellectually disabled son rather than leave him to the vagaries of a State care system in which they have no faith.</P><Col N="1156"/>
    <P>In December 1997, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Cowen, stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">It is not acceptable that a parent of a son or daughter with a mental handicap should have to worry about who will look after their child when they are no longer able to care for him or her. I intend to ensure that their fears are allayed.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Eight years later, circumstances have not changed. To be fair, the short-lived Cowen plan made a small dent in some waiting lists, but the money soon drained away and the strategy has run into the sand again. Other political choices took over. Few fears have been allayed.</P>
    <P>Last year, this country was awash with colour, enthusiasm and celebration, and rightly so. We all remember it. We &ldquo;Shared the Feeling&rdquo; of the Special Olympics wholeheartedly. The opening and closing ceremonies in Dublin made us cheer and cry simultaneously. The athletes demonstrated their extraordinary talents and abilities. We saw legions of volunteers, and host towns went to great lengths to make their guests feel at home. The sun shone, the world was watching and we, perhaps deservedly, felt good about ourselves. It was fitting, in the European Year of People with Disabilities, that we would showcase the Special Olympics and focus on ability, not disability. There was, genuinely, a place for everyone, and we were all assured that life would never be the same again for people with disabilities. To an extent, that is true. The Special Olympics brought into sharp and glorious focus the achievements possible when people with disabilities are given the opportunity, support and resources they need to achieve their full potential. It was not a new message, but it was perhaps better visually displayed. Hopes were high last year; 2003 was a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; year.</P>
    <P>The year 1997 was a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; year too. It was a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; year for people with disabilities and for carers and advocates. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities reported in 1997. The report was a landmark document with over 400 recommendations. The most pivotal recommendation was the enactment of a Disability Bill to set out the rights of people with a disability and a means of redress for those whose rights are denied. Hopes were high. At last, equal citizenship rights were on the horizon, if not immediately, then surely within a short time. The economy had improved. The lean years were over. Surely the time had come. That was eight years ago.</P>
    <P>The commission stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">This in an ambitious report which, when the recommendations are implemented, should change the world for many people with disabilities, including their families and carers. That is no less than people with disabilities deserve and what they, as equal citizens of this State, are entitled to.</P><Col N="1157"/>
    <P FLI="0">The reality is different. Much of the hope has abated and anger and frustration has taken its place. Unfortunately for many, the world has not changed. Two years since the last Bill was withdrawn, we wait in vain for the disability Bill as another Government deadline flies by.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities took the unprecedented step of meeting again, in public, this year to urge the Government to publish the disability Bill. It expressed disappointment that the rate of change for people with disabilities was so slow. It deplored the lack of citizenship rights and urged the Government in this regard. Unfortunately, the Government, while repeatedly promising to publish the Bill, has failed to deliver. We are told there has been ongoing consultation, that the Bill is before Cabinet, that changes need to be made, that it is a priority and that we will have it some day soon, but not yet. We need to get real. We all know that the main fear of the Government is what it will cost to vindicate the rights of our citizens with a disability. That, it appears, is the bottom line about which the Government is worried.</P>
    <P>I remind the Government that we are committed in international law to vindicate the rights of our citizens with disabilities. Ireland is a signatory to the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Through that covenant we are obliged to take positive action to reduce structural disadvantages and to give appropriate preferential treatment to people with disabilities to allow them to participate fully within society. The covenant also reminds us that we will almost invariably have to spend more money to help overcome the barriers. Policy choices have to be made. I say to the Minister of State opposite that we should no longer avoid the choices.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are spouses, parents, children, students, workers, consumers, tenants, householders, passengers, taxpayers, patients, neighbours, friends and families, but they are not treated equally. Unemployment rates are higher, educational supports are more difficult to access and basic services are lacking.</P>
    <P>We disable people by not providing the appropriate supports they need to reach their potential. We further disable people by placing barriers in their way. We need to work to release the potential of people, not disable them further. I call on the Minister of State to join us in that task. We want to help the Government in this way. We do not want to politicise this issue.</P>
    <P>How can we stand over the fact that only 42% of people with a disability are in employment, half the rate of employment among the rest of the population? Is there any excuse for the fact that households headed by a person with a disability are even more at risk of poverty? According to the Combat Poverty Agency they are the highest risk group, even higher than they were ten years ago? In a country awash with money, it is damning that two thirds of <Col N="1158"/>households headed by a person with a disability fall below the 60% median income line.</P>
    <P>These figures are scandalous. I am sure none of us in this House likes what they say about us, our priorities and the kind of Ireland we have become. Why, after ten years of continuous economic growth, are disability and poverty still inextricably linked? Why are people with disabilities and their families still marginalised within society? How can the Government claim to rest on its laurels in the face of such stark facts?</P><?oasys _ah?>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended three forms of payment to people with a disability, among them a cost of disability payment. This recommendation echoed the terms of a 1993 UN resolution which said, &ldquo;States should ensure that the provision of support services takes into account the costs frequently incurred by persons with disabilities and their families as a result of disability.&rdquo; The National Disability Authority&rsquo;s recently published research report into the cost of disability endorses the commission&rsquo;s recommendation that participation should be facilitated. There is no sign of a cost of disability allowance nor any promise of one in the Government&rsquo;s list of achievements and promises which forms the basis of its hollow amendment to this motion.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>People with disabilities should not have to rely on the goodwill of the general public. They should not have to try over and over again to convince the Government that, as equal citizens of the State, they should enjoy the same rights and privileges as their able fellow citizens. We need the disability Bill to impose a duty on those who would provide public services to include the needs of our citizens with disabilities. One of those who made a submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities said, &ldquo;People with disabilities do not want to be pitied, nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is a little respect and basic needs and rights. Surely that is not too much to ask.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This evening&rsquo;s motion says it is not too much to ask. Basic rights and needs are not too much to ask of any civilised, prosperous, grown-up society like ours. It is not simply a question of money. It is a question of joined up Government and of creating for ourselves a more civilised society where we recognise the human rights and dignity of people with a disability and in which we give them the support and, where necessary, the care they need. It is a mark of a mature society not simply to apportion blame or claim credit. We should share responsibility and commitment and work towards a vision and a programme of action to achieve the common good. The common good demands that we vindicate the rights of people with disabilities and ensure that people who are marginalised excluded and under-valued are allowed to achieve their full potential and are supported in doing so.</P><Col N="1159"/>
    <P>Despite all the Government says it has done, the United Nations committee on economic, social and cultural rights sounded its worries about the persistence of discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities in Ireland in 2002. That is hardly surprising when we have people confined to psychiatric hospitals whose mental health would allow them to live well in the community, when people with intellectual disabilities are still living inappropriately in psychiatric facilities, when we have a major social crisis caused by the persistent marginalisation of people with a disability, when our ability &mdash; or more correctly, the political will &mdash; to accommodate them properly and meaningfully in society is largely absent. For years, people with disabilities have listened to words such as &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;integrate&rdquo;, &ldquo;empower&rdquo; and &ldquo;enable&rdquo;. It is now time for action.</P>
    <P>The Government has nothing to fear from the publication of the disability Bill. Perhaps the Government is playing politics with its Bill. It is unlikely that the Bill, as published, will be the magical solution to all the problems experienced by people with disabilities. Why has the Government postponed publication of the Bill until after the local elections? The Government should publish the Bill and let us debate it. There is no legislation that cannot be improved. I urge the Minister to publish the Bill and to take example from the Minister for Education and Science who, to his credit, will send a very different Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill to the Seanad from that which was first published. The Joint Committee on Education and Science heard 52 submissions on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. The select committee had lengthy discussions on Committee Stage and the Minister has changed the focus of the Bill and has changed its title. It has become much more positive. There is nothing wrong with debating a Bill. I ask the Government to publish the disability Bill, bring it to the House and let us debate it and improve it, if necessary. Let us work together. This should not be a political issue but by postponing publication of the Bill the Government is making it one. The Minister for Education and Science engaged with the select committee on Committee Stage and the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill has been improved dramatically.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the publication of the Bill and its passage through the House, we need to have a disability summit. This would engage the disability sector and the Government in the implementation of the Bill. It would mean the Government would have to produce another national development plan, effectively a national development plan for people with a disability. None exists at present, as the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary showed. This would show that the Government means to deliver the services and that people with disabilities would not have to <Col N="1160"/>wait and hope on every budget day for a famine or a feast to fund services. This has been the pattern over the past decade and we must break out of this mind set.</P>
    <P>Such engagement would also negate the consistent background briefing which says that rights are too expensive, that we would break the country if we gave rights or that people with disabilities will clog up the courts, spending scarce resources on taking the Government to task. There is no need for such confrontational talk. There is no reason to think a rights based disability Bill would lead to further litigation. In fact, the lack of a Bill leaves people with no option other than to go to court. Three or four of the families featured in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary ended their submissions by saying they had to go to court. Families are being forced into court in an attempt to get services, support and rights. That is not good enough.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>It is a disgrace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is need for planning and for inclusion of people with disabilities in that planning. There is no dispute in this House about what needs to be done. What is in dispute is when. Unless the Bill is accompanied by real engagement in an action plan within an identified time frame, it will fail. Should that happen it will be tragedy for the disability sector and will set back progress for years.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the disability legislation consultation group who have worked so hard to convince the Government that the Bill must provide real rights. Its document, Equal Citizens, is a clear blueprint for the legislation and for the progressive realisation of rights. No one expects all rights to appear tomorrow with the wave of a magic wand. However, there should not be barriers to inclusion. It is the political and moral duty of the State to in every way possible enable and encourage independent living for everyone with a disability. I commend the work done by the centres for independent living. To make independence a reality we must create a system that asks people not what they have but what they need to fulfil their potential.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>We acknowledge that there has been massive investment by the Government but this improvement is coming from a very low base. The needs are still as great as ever. It is clear there is a lack of accountability in how the money is spent and the Government must address this issue. In the D&aacute;il only last week, the Taoiseach underlined this when he said the &euro;1.2 billion he claimed was spent in the disability sector &ldquo;must be doing something&rdquo;. There is a clear need to ensure that the money Voted by this House is spent in a cost effective way and, above all, delivers appropriate services and supports to the people for whom it was intended. The Government, the Minister or the Department gives money to the various service providers who then provide services. <Col N="1161"/>However, even the Minister for Health and Children recently expressed his concern regarding accountability in the spending of this money. I do not claim that service providers are doing anything wrong but we must know where the money is going. Is it being spent properly and do service providers need assistance in deciding how it is spent?</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>The Government must immediately make plans to provide the kind of money that will accelerate the necessary change in tangible and practical ways. We need a new timetable of change that will allow people to take full advantage of educational and employment opportunities and lead to real service provision.</P>
    <P>Incremental developments, dependent solely on economic growth, will not resolve this crisis. This is all a matter of political choice. Choices such as spending &euro;52 million on electronic voting and millions of euros on Abbotstown or on Punchestown are made easily. It should be no hardship to plan with and for people with disabilities to vindicate their rights.</P>
    <P>There is no further time to delay; the time is now. The Government should publish the Bill, agree to the summit and prove to people with disabilities that it has the will and the way to make the Bill work.</P>
    <P>A man with a disability wrote the following on the eve of the budget of 1999:</P>
    <P LI="1">Recognising the daily evidence of the spending power which is now all around us, how long more do you expect us to keep faith with the political process? Given the present booming state of our economy, how much longer are we expected to wait for delivery on commitments made a decade ago? Let us have no more false promises. Let budget day be the start of real, honest and sustained action to deliver on a long overdue commitment.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Has anything changed?</P>
    <P>We need early intervention. The CABAS school in Cork, which has been operating on a pilot basis for years, is doing terrific work and needs to be established on a permanent basis. Many similar schools need to be provided.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be easy to begin a speech like this with recrimination. People with disabilities and their families feel let down and betrayed by promises made and broken, hardships and stresses that have been ignored and by a commitment to rights abandoned. Those of us who know families that struggle with the consequences of disability know only too well the pain and frustration they feel.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to recriminate. The motion before the House, in the drafting of which the Labour Party participated fully, is, as Deputy Stanton said, about making progress and not about scoring points. I begin, therefore, by urging <Col N="1162"/>the Government to consider carefully this motion which not alone has the support of the Opposition but also of a great many people within the disability movement. In a sense the motion represents a sacrifice for them too because instead of insisting on rights now, it points the way towards the progressive realisation of rights. It demonstrates how a consensus might be developed around a strategy for dealing, once and for all, with an area of neglect and disadvantage that has been a blight on public policy throughout the years of our economic growth and prosperity.</P>
    <P>Last year was the European Year of People with Disabilities. The year commenced with a protest and ended with a summit. The protest was a solemn occasion when a large number of families from all around the country came to the launch of the European Year of People with Disabilities at the Mansion House to express their fears for the future. Many of us met those parents, as we have done time and again. The questions have not changed. &ldquo;What happens to my child when I die?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I cope with my child when he or she still needs to be helped to do many of the things others take for granted and I am crippled with arthritis or otherwise unable to do the things I used to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;How, when I am elderly, do I cope with the shouting, the suffering, the violence, the incontinence, the emotional distress that my child&rsquo;s disability causes?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I make policy makers understand that my child will need help and support through the many years of my ageing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Throughout last year some of those questions seemed to fade into the background as some of the other achievements took over. There was the highlight of the year, the Special Olympics World Summer Games, and the groundswell of public and community support it engendered. The games in many ways reflected a view throughout Ireland that people with intellectual disabilities are an integral and respected part of our community, citizens of real achievement. In the aftermath of the games additional money was provided for much-needed services. Throughout the year there was a form of dialogue on the development of a long-promised and keenly-awaited disability Bill.</P>
    <P>At different times in that dialogue it seemed that real progress was going to be made. For instance, following a meeting with the Disability Legislation Consultative Group on 15 July last year, the Taoiseach was reported in the following day&rsquo;s newspapers as saying he was committed to rights-based legislation. A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said he favoured the greater access to courts to enforce rights upheld by the Bill&rsquo;s appeals mechanism. However, as the year went on the language began to change. The year ended with a summit organised by the National Disability Authority in the Royal Hospital, <Col N="1163"/>Kilmainham. The summit was opened by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and closed by the Taoiseach, both of whom made long speeches and managed to avoid mentioning the previous explicit commitment to rights-based legislation. By the end of the European year the term &ldquo;rights&rdquo; had disappeared entirely from the Government lexicon and had been replaced by phrases such as &ldquo;positive action measures&rdquo; and &ldquo;cross-cutting policies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Throughout the European Year of People with Disabilities, waiting lists for essential services across all forms of disability remained almost stagnant. There is no need for me to repeat the figures here. What must be stressed again and again is that despite the huge level of community support for people with disabilities, they continue to be neglected at every level of public policy. The hallmarks of public policy have been insufficient resources, no strategic thinking, no planning and no political commitment to rights. Government Ministers, when they speak of the issue of disability, now refer to an annual investment of a &euro;1 billion. From where did this figure come and how is it made up? Is the Government lumping together direct income payments, tax allowances, capital investment in access to public buildings and so on to make up a figure that looks far larger than it actually is? The truth is that no service-providing agency in Ireland in any area of disability service is able to plan for the future. Every service-providing agency is dealing with emergencies and only emergencies. None have been able to offer new places in residential care, training, education or sheltered or other forms of employment.</P>
    <P>There are so many different forms of disability that affect life in so many ways and the response of Government and the community must be multifaceted. That was the reason for the establishment of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities &mdash; the majority of the members of which had a disability &mdash; under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Flood, the first time such a body had ever been established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the commission made 402 recommendations, many of which have been implemented in one form or another in the intervening years. Its core recommendation, however, has been at the heart of the disability movement&rsquo;s struggle. It is noteworthy that members of the commission saw fit to come together last month to remind us that the commitment to rights-based legislation has still not been honoured. Why is that so? Why has it proven so difficult to make progress on this objective to which every party in this House is committed and which is explicitly promised in the programme for Government? The first answer is to be found in a quotation from Towards Equal <Col N="1164"/>Citizenship, a booklet published by the Government in early 2000 which reviewed the progress made in implementing the commission&rsquo;s recommendations. In terms of the legal entitlement to assessment and a statement of needs, it states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Department of Finance cannot accept these recommendations which imply the underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as a right. This right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the eventual cost of providing these services.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Put simply, the Department of Finance, then and now, views people with disabilities as some sort of appalling vista. It believes any concept of rights for people with disabilities will bankrupt the State; any notion that a woman with a brain-injured husband should have an automatic right to our support is, apparently, a threat to our national security; and any idea that an adult with an intellectual disability should have our support to live as independently as possible is seditious. However, the people of Ireland hold a different view to that of the Department of Finance on such matters. None of that is true. The introduction of a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities would not bankrupt the State, it would challenge the system to respond appropriately and not before time.</P>
    <P>It is because so much time has passed and because the system has failed to respond that the Labour Party, with the Green Party and Fine Gael, proposes the motion before the House tonight. We all know, though the Government will still not admit it, that no comprehensive set of rights will be enacted by this Government. For ideological and political reasons, it has decided to add it to the list of broken promises. That need not happen. The Opposition believes real progress will be made if the Government is prepared to sit down with people with disabilities, their advocates and families, and public bodies in this area and to treat them all as equal partners in the development of a comprehensive strategy. People with disabilities have long since come to the view that rights will not happen overnight.</P>
    <P>The greatest insult they have been offered is the often-repeated assertion by Ministers that if they are granted rights, they will spend all their time running to the courts. Surely the time has come for all the points scoring, evasion and broken promises to stop. A proper, meaningful engagement, built around the twin concepts of progressive realisation of rights and an agreed strategy to put resources in place, is the best way forward. On behalf of the Labour Party I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>One rarely encounters despair on the doorsteps anymore; one encounters anger, frustration and unhappiness. However, when one encounters the parents of a child with a disability one often then encounters despair. It is in their eyes and in their inability to articulate the depth of anger, depression and despair they experience in caring for a loved one. That despair will be there until there is rights based legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Those who care for a loved one with a disability are locked into a cycle of care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They are locked by a padlock of dependency. For many, there is no way out of that cycle. We must offer hope to them.</P> 
    <P>I am all too well aware of the issue of disability as I have a younger sister who has a disability. She has seven siblings and we were able to help with her care so there was not an onus on our parents. Our family was fortunate enough not to be in a poverty cycle when caring for her. She is fortunate enough to live in a Camphill community in County Kilkenny. She is privileged to be there but that should not be the case. It should not be a matter of luck or having a family with resources. It should be a right. That right has been denied to many people in Ireland today. The reality for many is to be institutionalised. The reality for many is poverty. The reality for many is despair.</P>
    <P>Why is the Government raising false hopes by saying the legislation will be before the House imminently, in the spring, in the autumn, in the next spring and now perhaps in the summer. Why raise those false hopes for so many people? Why is there a sliding date for the publication of the legislation? Why is there no financial commitment? If strong legislation is to be enacted, why is Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Finance, not putting the money aside to ensure the legislation will have some clout and weight?</P>
    <P>My colleague spoke of references to prohibitive expenses by the Department of Finance. Why is it that after the lull in the Celtic tiger economy, it is the least well-off in society who are deemed to be those who will have to wait a little longer? There should be different priorities in 21st century Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why did Deputy Kirk have the audacity to say last week at the Disability Federation of Ireland conference in Croke Park that there should not be rights because of the danger of clogging up the courts? He said that at a gathering of carers of people with a disability.</P>
    <P>The Green Party asks the Government to introduce strong legislation to ensure that people do not take recourse to the courts, to ensure that people are given the rights that have been denied them for so long. For years voluntary bodies and community networks have been doing Trojan <Col N="1166"/>work in the area of disability. I am humbled by their commitment, determination and progress. Unless that legislation enshrines those rights in law, that legislation is empty and seriously deficient.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights states: &ldquo;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&rdquo; The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states in Articles 11, 12 and 13, that everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living, including housing; the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the right to education. It is difficult to believe that Ireland, as a signatory to this convention, has failed its most vulnerable citizens by not ensuring their access to all those rights.</P>
    <P>The disability allowance is currently one third the average industrial wage and I question that standard of living. I agree with the recommendations that disability allowance should be benchmarked at 50% of the average industrial wage, which would amount to a payment of more than &euro;250 per week. Many people are subsisting on one third of that sum. According to the ESRI, more than half of all households headed by an ill or disabled person are living at or below the 60% poverty line. Just because a person is disabled does not mean he eats less, wants less desirable things, or uses less heat than others. The Government must believe this is the case because why else would it provide an allowance for persons with disabilities that is less than one third the average industrial wage?</P>
    <P>The issue of housing must be addressed. New buildings must be fully accessible and prepared for a lifetime of living. I am not convinced that enough attention is being paid to those considerations. I am not convinced that enough attention is being paid to the issue of enforcement, to ensure that buildings are being built which are truly accessible to people with disabilities. On the question of retrofitting and making existing buildings accessible to those with disabilities, some local authorities have ceased to accept applications for the disability grant. Why would a Government put its signature to a convention that promotes these very basic requirements and yet deny people access to those rights? A house which cannot be accessed and is not prepared for one&rsquo;s needs is not truly a home.</P>
    <P>Whether it be education, housing, an adequate standard of living or health, two vital ingredients are required to ensure that people with disabilities can meet their needs: they are funding and support. That commitment is required from Government.</P>
    <P>Collective responsibility is required from all Departments to ensure that people with disabilities are fully supported in all aspects of life. A centralised records system to link health <Col N="1167"/>and education is required to ensure information is available on the needs of people with disabilities. There are no available statistics on the number of child carers in Ireland. A comparative study of practices, resources and support mechanisms in other countries is required.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the disability legislation consultation group. It has provided a list of priorities and a blueprint for what is required in the legislation. I call on the Government to act without delay and not to make empty promises about legislation being imminent, in the spring, next month, early in the next session. I ask the Government to put the funding and legislation in place to ensure that those with disabilities are recognised as human beings with the rights due to any citizen in Irish society.</P>

  <P el="5"><?oasys _is2p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>notes the significant improvement of the funding and conditions relating to the disabled persons grant scheme since 1998:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is3p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>the maximum grant has doubled from &euro;10,158 to &euro;20,320;</P>

 <P el="5"><?oasys _is3p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?> equality legislation to be updated by the Equality Bill, 2004 which is currently at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">The proposed motion is very broad-ranging, and covers legislative proposals, policy development, service provision and some of the social, family and personal difficulties which undoubtedly arise for certain people with disabilities. I propose to deal with the issues as they relate to the disability Bill and the framework for disability service provision. Other speakers will cover the range of issues that span the roles of several other Departments. I will focus on how Government policy has developed in recent years to effectively <Col N="1170"/>promote and safeguard the right of people with disabilities to equal treatment and how our current strategy will enhance the infrastructure for service delivery, improve accessibility and introduce a number of related positive actions.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prepare a disability Bill which will support the social inclusion of people with disabilities. This was spelt out clearly in An Agreed Programme for Government which states that the Government will &ldquo;complete consultations on the Disabilities Bill and will bring the amended Bill through the Oireachtas and include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement.&rdquo; The intention is to give statutory effect to a range of important policies as they relate to people with disabilities, establish systems for assessment of need and service provision and specify appropriate administrative infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also address other important issues, including access to public buildings, information and mainstream public services, the use of genetic testing data, positive action for public service employment and the concept of universal design. The Bill will provide a statutory basis for sectoral planning regarding services of particular importance to people with disabilities, namely, transport, training and employment, health and personal social services, social welfare, advocacy and physical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Government has progressively advanced the disability equality agenda in recent years, building on the conclusions of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities of 1996. To date, there have been three important phases in the process. First, the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation and, second, the mainstreaming of service delivery for people with disabilities. The third phase in the process centres on strengthening service delivery and involves the preparation of a broad-ranging positive action framework, one element of which is the disability Bill.</P>
    <P>In the course of recent debate on disability issues, people may to some extent have lost sight of how the measures taken since the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities compare with what the commission recommended. Listening to some commentators, one might be inclined to conclude that no action had been taken to follow up on the commission&rsquo;s work. This impression has been reinforced by recent calls to introduce the disability legislation recommended by the commission. To put the record into some perspective, much of the central focus of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations was for legislation that would eradicate discrimination against people with disabilities. The legislation sought by the commission would outlaw discrimination with particular reference to the provision of services by State and semi-State <Col N="1171"/>bodies, private amenities which offer services to the public, the insurance industry as well as in employment and education. The overall thrust of the commission&rsquo;s legislative recommendation was to ensure that discrimination was outlawed and that effective sanctions against any attempted discrimination would be introduced.</P>
    <P>While it is true that no legislation has been enacted which has addressed disability discrimination only, Deputies are well aware that strong multi-ground employment equality and equal status legislation has been in place since 1998 and 2000, respectively. It is in this context that many of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities have already been realised. The legislation is among the most advanced in Europe and pre-dates recent EU directives which can be expected to enhance equality legislation in many European countries.</P>
    <P>Under the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, people who are discriminated against on the grounds of disability or any one of eight other grounds have a statutory right of redress. The equality infrastructure which supports this right comprises two elements, namely, the Equality Authority whose role is to work towards the achievement of equality of opportunities and the elimination of discrimination, and the Equality Tribunal which makes determinations regarding complaints of discrimination and offers mediation in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>Some relevant statistics indicate that the equality infrastructure is well used and recognised. In 2003, for instance, complaints on disability grounds accounted for approximately 10% of cases referred to the Equality Tribunal. It is interesting that the numbers of cases referred under the Equal Status Act were nearly double those for employment equality issues. This reflects the fact that employment rights have been widely recognised for some time. In addition, the right to equal treatment in the provision of goods and services is being more actively pursued and receiving appropriate support from statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The enactment of our anti-discrimination legislation was followed in 2000 by the launch by the Taoiseach of a mainstreaming approach to disability service delivery. In this context, mainstreaming means the delivery of service for people with disabilities by public bodies which provide the service for everybody else. The approach replaced a service delivery model which bore the hallmarks of separation and segregation with one that seeks to focus on the integration of services for people with disabilities with the generality of public service provision.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the mainstreaming principle has been carried through in the <Col N="1172"/>preparation of the proposed disability Bill. This work, perhaps more than any other legislation in the past, has required the active and concentrated engagement of a range of Departments, focusing specifically on the most effective ways to enhance mainstream service delivery and support access for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I note the motion proposed by the Opposition calls for a form of consultative summit on disability issues. Extensive consultations have taken place with representatives of the disability sector about the disability Bill. The Bill is a proposal for legislation and, like other legislation, it is the intention of Government to present it to the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate by elected representatives in the usual manner. I remain to be convinced that the normal legislative process will not provide the appropriate forum for the required debate on the disability Bill.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill is part of the present phase of policy development the Government is undertaking to further advance participation in society by persons with disabilities. Recalling the collaborative work of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Government has established and maintained close consultation with the disability sector during the preparation of the legislative proposals. In April 2002, an expert consultation team of experts in legal, economic and social affairs was appointed to oversee the consultation process. The team met stakeholders, including the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Departments and received their views before completing its task in February 2003.</P>
    <P>The Disability Legislation Consultation Group is an organisation representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers which was brought together by the National Disability Authority to facilitate dialogue at national level within the sector and with the Government.</P>

	<P>Much of the discussion about the Bill has centred on a demand for rights-based legislation. Some argue that the legislation must provide access to the courts for the adjudication of individual cases. It has also been forcefully presented that both the needs assessment process and service provision should be free of resource constraints.</P>
    <P>At one of the meetings with the DLCG last year, the Taoiseach commented that a more productive dialogue on rights is possible if there is recognition of the complexity of the issues and the relationship between rights and standards. A right of redress in the event of discrimination and well established promotional and redress structures are available in Ireland.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue proposed in some quarters goes beyond equal access and suggests that individual rights to particular State services should be laid down in law. The Government is entirely supportive of measures to facilitate social inclusion. However, I do not believe an uncritical acceptance of a right to services approach would realise the outcome which all concerned would like to see.</P>

	<P>How does the Minister reconcile his statement that he does &ldquo;not believe an uncritical acceptance of a right to services approach would realise the outcome which all concerned would like to see&rdquo; with the following statement by a parent on television last week, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t die and leave that boy behind because I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; and the comments of other parents who said they may have to commit suicide and kill their children as <Col N="1174"/>well because they cannot leave them to the vagaries of the State?</P>

	<P>That is the answer to everything.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>A central element in a programme to assure equitable service provision for people with disabilities is the assessment of their individual needs. I agree with the view put forward by the DLCG that assessment of need must be independent and that means of complaint, appeal and enforcement are an essential part of that process.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill will put effective systems for assessment and redress in place. We have sought to find a way to allow for an effective and independent assessment in framing the Bill. At the same time, we intend to establish a framework that will focus available resources on the provision of services that are most needed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that people with disabilities get the services they need. I am also concerned that levels of service provision are expanded over time so that they respond to identified needs. The Bill will require that each person assessed is provided with a statement of the individual health, personal social service and education services that can be delivered and an indication of the timeframe for their delivery. The Bill will also require that aggregate information about the contents of assessments axed service statements is prepared as a basis for service planning. The contents of individual service statements and the capacity to plan for the development of services are directly linked to the available resources and <Col N="1175"/>to political decisions about competing service priorities.</P>
    <P>Comparative research published by the Economic and Social Research Institute last year is interesting. The research compared the scenario in other countries, which, like Ireland, have a legal structure based on common law, namely, the US, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Sweden. The research indicated that even where a person has a right to assessment of their needs, this does not automatically lead to the provision of all the services involved or having the provision of those services enforced by the courts. Each country surveyed has pursued a path that takes account of its individual legal, political and administrative structures.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill is part of a comprehensive framework, which will, over time, produce significant positive advances for people with disabilities. Other elements of the framework include the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003, which is awaiting Report Stage in the D&aacute;il &mdash; like the disability Bill, this measure provides for an individualised approach to assessment and support services and the Comhairle (amendment) Bill, which will establish advocacy services for people with disabilities and will be published by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs at the same time as the disability Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The principle of facilitating people with disabilities to speak in their own voice is of vital importance and the provision of advocacy services will be particularly significant. Sectoral plans for key public services will be published in draft form and I anticipate they will provide an important element in planning future services. Each Department concerned will facilitate consultation before each plan can be finalised for submission to the Oireachtas. I look forward to much constructive consultation and debate in this regard. This is a further illustration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to adequate consultation and debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Consultation means the Government listens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest element of the framework is the Equality Bill 2004 which updates our existing advanced equality laws to ensure full compliance with EU directives.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the significant challenge to put in place the framework to enhance service delivery for people with disabilities. The framework is broad, dealing with health, education, employment, advocacy, physical access to buildings and transport. The Government is conscious of the complexity and cross-cutting <Col N="1176"/>nature of the issues involved and, to support ministerial engagement throughout the process, referred oversight of the Bill and other elements of the framework to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The Government and the Cabinet committee are paying particular attention to the Bill and the views emerging through the consultation process. The Bill will be published as soon as the Government has completed its work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made and continue to make significant progress in advancing the disability equality agenda. I am confident the disability Bill will introduce the systems and structures which will effectively advance the agenda further. The Bill will demonstrate that Ireland can be among the most progressive of its European neighbours. It will establish a statutory basis for assessment, service provision and the infrastructure to effectively deliver key services to those who need them most.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to producing a disability Bill was part of the programme agreed with the social partners in Sustaining Progress, and that commitment will be met. The concept of partnership which underpins various national agreements has also been a feature of the preparation of this Bill, which has as its focus the participation of people with disabilities in society. It was acknowledged in Sustaining Progress that &ldquo;the proposed legislation will require an integrated and concerted cross-departmental approach and action&rdquo; and this is the principle on which preparation of the Bill has been based. This process has, by its nature been complex and time-consuming, but the time spent in drawing together the different strands of public service activity administered by different Departments will pay dividends in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill will give statutory effect to a range of important policies as they relate to people with disabilities and will establish systems for assessment of need and service provision as well as specifying the infrastructure for their delivery. The Bill needs to be viewed in the context of the overall framework of measures which are being put in place to reinforce existing disability equality structures. Essential elements in the progress achieved to date have been the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation and the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities. The current stage of development involves strengthening service delivery through the preparation of a wide-ranging positive action <Col N="1177"/>framework, one element of which is the disability Bill.</P>
    <P>The legislation will underpin the principle of mainstreaming and provide for positive action measures to remove barriers to equal participation for people with disabilities. It will, as the Government promised in An Agreed Programme for Government, include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. The Bill will establish systems for assessment of need and service provision and specify infrastructure for policy delivery and redress. The Government is convinced of the importance of effective redress mechanisms if services committed in the Bill are not delivered. Statute-based complaints anal appeals structures will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Bill will legislate for an independent assessment process giving individuals a right to a needs assessment which would be undertaken without regard to resources. This will be a significant achievement and will benefit individuals in the first place by providing a full picture of their needs while at the same time benefiting future planning of services. As the Minister for Defence stated, the level of service delivery will be affected by the available resources, as is the case with all public services and in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, the Bill will provide important structures, which will improve the way we approach the resourcing of services for people with disabilities and support and drive the development of capacity over time. It will also provide the basis for a co-ordinated approach to service development and delivery for persons with disabilities. As Deputies would also expect, the Bill will address access issues, particularly in respect of public buildings, services and information for people with disabilities. It is important that public service providers should demonstrate best practice as a model for other sectors of the economy.</P>
   
    <P>The standards for access and mainstream service provision required in the Bill will be founded on National Disability Authority&rsquo;s codes of practice. There have been improvements in the accessibility of public services since the enactment of equality legislation. The provisions of the Bill in this area will act as a driver of change in a programmatic way. In addition, it can be expected that sectoral plans will set out a range of actions to make public transport and physical infrastructure accessible, as well as the enhancement of disability-specific health, social welfare and employment services.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since the introduction of a mainstreaming approach to service delivery for persons with disabilities, training and employment services for people with disabilities have been restructured. Employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy in the <Col N="1178"/>Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This is evident in the further development of incentive schemes and supports by that Department.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>The Government has also continued to support initiatives to encourage public service employers to achieve a 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities. Although not all sectors have achieved the target, some bodies have surpassed it and, overall, there has been steady progress. The Bill provides an opportunity to give statutory backing to such positive action measures for the recruitment and employment of persons with disabilities in the public service. Such provision would build on existing employment targets and foster concerted action across the public sector.</P>
    <P>A minority of people with disabilities have certain genetic conditions and in recent years there have been concerns about the impact of genetic testing on their ability to access certain services, which may reinforce a cycle of poverty and exclusion. In particular, this includes data used for insurance, mortgage and employment purposes. The Bill will aim to remove such barriers by including provisions aimed at enabling people with disabilities to access reasonable insurance cover for the purpose of house purchase, for example. It will eradicate certain loopholes that affect these people and enhance opportunities for economic independence.</P>
    <P>The Disability Bill 2001 provided for the establishment of a centre of excellence in universal design to promote and support the adoption of principles in universal design, particularly by the key players who design, plan and construct our environment. Such a centre would respond both to existing Government commitments and to best practice under the e-Europe action plan. As Deputies will expect, a similar provision will be contained in the amended disability Bill.</P>
    <P>With a broad policy base on the lines just described, the disability Bill envisaged by the Government will become a powerful catalyst for change for people with disabilities. It is important to recognise that the Bill is but one element, albeit a key element, in the framework being put in place by the Government to underpin the equal participation by people with disabilities in society. Other elements of the framework, with which we are all familiar, include: the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003; the Comhairle (amendment) Bill which will establish advocacy services for people with disabilities; the sectoral plans for key public services; and existing equality legislation and the Equality Bill 2004, which is being dealt with in the House.</P>
    <P>Let us consider other elements of the framework. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill makes detailed provision for the education of children with special educational <Col N="1179"/>needs. The Bill is designed to address children&rsquo;s rights under Article 42 of the Constitution, which already entitles each child to free primary education. It establishes the national council for special education and sets out a range of services which must be provided. It includes a new framework for the assessment of and provision for the needs of children with educational disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle (Amendment) Bill is being prepared in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It provides for a new service, to be administered by Comhairle, to allow for the assignment of a personal advocate to persons with disabilities who require particular support in accessing social services.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not delivered. He had two years to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The personal advocate will assist, support and represent the person in applying for and obtaining a social service and will help pursue any right of review or appeal in connection with that service.</P>
    <P>It is intended that outline sectoral plans will be published at the same time as the disability Bill. As I mentioned, the plans are intended to set out a range of actions to make physical infrastructure accessible, as well as enhance disability-specific health, social welfare and employment services. The outline plans are under preparation and will be published by each of the Departments concerned to coincide with the disability Bill.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be consultation with disability interest groups and mainstream service providers before the plans are finalised for submission to the Oireachtas at a later stage. The plans will set out a range of measurable actions that each Department is committed to undertaking in key areas. They will, over time, through a co-ordinated strategy for positive action, help remove barriers to participation by people with disabilities in society. The approach proposed would involve presentation of the final plans to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Equality Bill 2004, which is currently on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, amends the Employment Equality Act 1998 in accordance with the requirements of an EU directive. The key change regarding employees with disabilities is that the Bill will place a duty on employers to adapt the workplace to facilitate their needs, unless such a measure would impose a disproportionate burden. The task of transposing the directive into Irish legislation has probably been more straightforward than it has been for many other EU countries due to our already advanced anti-discrimination legislation. This achievement is generally recognised throughout the EU.</P><Col N="1180"/>

	<P>There has been much debate on the question of rights-based legislation, the complexities of which the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, has already addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will establish entitlements to assessment of need, to services set out in a related service statement and to redress if the assessment or the services are not provided. The Bill cannot ignore the reality that funding and resources are finite. Therefore, services will grow as budgetary and staffing constraints are overcome. This approach is grounded in reality and deals with the actual delivery of tangible results.</P>

	<P>It is down to money.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there anything new&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the allegations of a delay. There is no plot to delay the Bill. There is real work taking place across a range of Departments to deliver two Bills &mdash; the disability Bill and the Comhairle (amendment) Bill &mdash; and six draft sectoral plans. The issues involved are complex and cut across a broad range of policy areas. The Bill remains a Government priority and it will be published as soon as the Government and the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion have completed their work.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a strong record in recent years in the area of disability equality. On equality and mainstream service provision, our administrative and legislative provisions compare well with the best European practice. This is evidenced in the European Commission&rsquo;s multiannual action plan, which supports the legitimate demands for equal rights of people with disabilities, especially in employment. The action plan also focuses on the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities. The EU Commission has indicated that the major priority for the enlarged EU should be the implementation of the employment equality directives in all member states. These two key future objectives of the enlarged EU <Col N="1181"/>regarding disability are already law and practice in this country for some years.</P>
    <P>The awareness of our population regarding people with disabilities and their right to equality is ahead of that in other European countries and other common law countries. The challenge we as legislators face is to put in place a well-focused, practical framework to enhance service delivery to people with disabilities. I have no doubt the proposed disability Bill will again show this country can be among the most progressive in Europe when it comes to establishing a statutory basis for assessment, service provision and the infrastructure for the effective delivery of those key services. I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, slashed funding across the board, including for St. Michael&rsquo;s House in my constituency and for people with autism. Unbelievably, that happened in the European year for citizens with disability and the year of the Special Olympics. That is how the Government delivered.</P>

	<P>The most disingenuous statement I have seen in a long time is contained in the Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendment to this motion, in which the Government &ldquo;acknowledges the complexity and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved in preparing the Disability Bill&rdquo;. It took the Government seven long years to realise that but there is still no end in sight.</P>
    <P>There was a conference recently in the Mansion House which I was proud to attend with our party spokesperson, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan. We heard, at first hand, what needed to be done from the representatives of citizens with disability and from citizens with disability. It requires relatively small amounts of money. With your background, a Cheann Comhairle, you would readily accede to these demands but the Government will not.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Ireland is an extremely rich country. It is one of the richest in Europe, regardless of whether one calculates it on the basis of GDP or GNP. However, it is a country in which a small population of vulnerable citizens face frustration, distress, fear and pain. They face these conditions as a result of Government choices &mdash; there is no other reason. When this Government was formed, it published An Agreed Programme for Government outlining the choices it was prepared to make. On disability it said:</P>
    <P LI="1">We are committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their <Col N="1184"/>potential and make full contribution to the economic and social life of our country.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">We will complete the programme of expansion of appropriate care places for people with disabilities, with, in particular, the ending of the inappropriate use of psychiatric hospitals for persons with intellectual disabilities. [That was another badly broken promise.]</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">We will complete consultations on the Disabilities Bill and will bring the amended Bill through the Oireachtas and include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Today is the second anniversary of the day the Government took office, and none of those commitments appears any closer to being honoured today than they were two years ago.</P>
    <P>Every waiting list for essential services is either the same or has lengthened. In particular, the nearly 500 people still living in entirely inappropriate conditions in psychiatric hospitals, such as St. Ita&rsquo;s in Portrane, represent a continuing and desperate scandal. From time to time that scandal is highlighted in a graphic manner. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme a week ago brought home to many the stark reality of disability in the lives of too many people. We are aware of the statistics and the waiting lists but &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; performed a valuable public service by putting faces to the statistics and showing the pressure and the pain behind the figures.</P>
    <P>What will be done about it? This is not a crisis that can be resolved without money or without a plan. Above all, it cannot be resolved without the political commitment that finally lifts people with disability from the end of the political queue. That is the purpose of this motion. It aims to involve people with disabilities as equal partners in the development of an agreed strategy to begin finally to address the issues facing them within an agreed timeframe and to address those issues on a rights basis. The situation is becoming more urgent and the longer action is delayed, the more trauma many people will experience.</P>
    <P>Many of the people with intellectual disability who are in increasingly urgent need of residential facilities are middle aged or older and are depending on increasingly frail and elderly parents. During the past year an agency in Dublin had to take an elderly man into residential care on an emergency basis. It had to treat him as an emergency because his mother, on whom he had depended all his life, had just died at the age of 102 years. There are highly disturbed adults with behavioural and emotional problems, with which their families can no longer cope, who need to be recognised by the State as citizens with the right to support. However, the only support available to them is a lengthening queue.</P>
    <P>Respite care is often the only support given to the families involved. It means an occasional <Col N="1185"/>break away from home for a week. It is a break from the 24 hour care which the 120,000 outstanding caring citizens provide for people with disability. It can provide enormous relief for families and a chance to gather their strength so they can continue to carry out their work. The care of an adult with intellectual disabilities, often accompanied by physical, emotional or behavioural problems, such as violence, incontinence, shouting and self-infliction of injury, involves 24-hour commitment and dedication. Disability in a family, in the absence of support from the wider community, can mean heartbreak and despair. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme graphically displayed this. The time has arrived when even this Government cannot brush cases such as this under the counter.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that approximately &euro;120 million in extra current revenue, with perhaps an additional &euro;80 million in capital revenue, would make significant inroads into waiting lists. It is incredible to consider that in recent months up to &euro;100 million has been wasted, of which &euro;52 million is represented by obsolete voting machines rotting in warehouses, waiting for an election that will never happen. That money could have been spent on these citizens and their families. If the &euro;200 million I mentioned were spent, it would enable people to live in dignity and comfort. It would enable services to be put in place that would contribute to lifelong education to help train people for work and give them hope for the future.</P>
    <P>That amount of money, in a budget of up to &euro;30 billion, is a pittance. The amount of additional spending required represents less than 0.5% of our annual budget. In an era when our public finances are still capable of producing massive current budget surpluses &mdash; there was good news for the Minister for Finance again a few months ago &mdash; it is our shame that we choose to spurn our most vulnerable citizens. Those who should be our first concern are the last concern of the Government. Even if the money is forthcoming, it will take time to build capacity, recruit the specialist teaching and caring staff needed, put the training programmes in place and ensure that the legacy of awareness created by the Special Olympics and the wonderful atmosphere of last summer is developed.</P>
    <P>The Government must accept that the time has finally come to confront the need to treat citizens with disability as equal citizens of this Republic. I support the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion tabled by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party, which I support unequivocally. Nevertheless I cannot help feeling a certain sense of futility and <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> as I stand to speak yet again on this topic. I cannot think of any matter that has been the <Col N="1186"/>subject of more Private Members&rsquo; motions than this and yet here we are again. It is a subject that touches virtually all of us as the spectrum of disability is enormous. If it does not touch us directly it touches someone close to us. Therefore, we all strongly and passionately feel the need for change. Uniquely this is a cross-party belief and commitment. However, despite the genuinely universal support for the disabled, nothing ever seems to change for the better. In every aspect of the service there is queuing, rationing and under provision. There is a battle for every service and in some cases there is no provision at all.</P>
    <P>This does not come as a surprise to either side of the House and those on this side of the House do not have a monopoly on caring. We are not alone in being outraged, embarrassed and diminished by the growing divergence between the quality of life enjoyed by the majority of us in this modern, proud and prosperous country and the half-life we see being endured by so many of the disabled and their families. However, if we are all so committed, then why do things not get better for the disabled? Why are they always left waiting for better times, an Exchequer surplus, another Celtic tiger, a Special Olympics, or another &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; expos&eacute;? It is because there is no clear overall strategy, implementation plan, or funding linked to a plan for the realisation of clearly articulated and commonly understood objectives.</P>
    <P>In seeking this, the motion goes to the very nub of the problem. We need a national strategy for the progressive realisation of rights to provision over an agreed timeframe setting in place the capacity building measures necessary, identifying the capital and current resources needed and preparing a plan to eliminate all waiting lists for services within three years.</P>
    <P>Without this we will go on as before, waiting for the pressure on services to build to the point where the many individual private crises explode to become a major public scandal. We will lurch from crisis to crisis and will deal in a fragmented way with individual aspects of disability. As politicians we will be content when we resolve the immediate crisis in one family, yet thousands of families will continue to wait for the next Celtic tiger or sadly until death makes their problem redundant. Even more sadly some families wish for that.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue as we have done in the past with the piecemeal response to individual campaigns &mdash; concessions given to individual groups in the hope they will go away and leave the Government alone for a while. We cannot continue to have Private Members&rsquo; motions in response to a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; expos&eacute; or some other effort by the media to dip into the issue of disability. We need a more permanent solution. The aim must be for a coherent integrated <Col N="1187"/>strategy so that no matter what the disability or age of the person, at the very least a floor level of appropriate service will automatically become available to support the patient and family, and it must be a floor with no cracks.</P>
    <P>The range of disability is enormous, including disability caused by mental ill health, which is often forgotten, despite being the cause of 20% of all disability. We have intellectual disability, and physical and sensory disability. Some are born disabled and some become disabled as a result of an accident or an illness, perhaps a degenerative and ultimately fatal one. However, whatever the source or the category of disability they all have one thing in common, the impact it has on their families and the extent to which it is a permanent life changing experience not just for the patients but also for their families. The greater the disability the greater the dependence, the greater the impact on the family and the greater the change they must endure.</P>
    <P>The diagnosis that a child is disabled is devastating. The diagnosis that a formerly healthy bread winner husband has a degenerative disease is devastating for a young mother with young children. Almost overnight such families are faced with new needs they never expected to have, and are ill-equipped to meet the emotional, psychological, practical, monetary and medical needs. If the carers in such a family do not get support, are left to cope alone and do not get respite, as sure as night follows day, they too will collapse and will not be able to cope. If they collapse, the whole family collapses and becomes the responsibility of the State with all the long-term consequences this implies, particularly for children. So instead of one dependent person, we then have an entire family dependent on the State.</P>
    <P>Luckily for the State, this does not happen very often because it is the nature of families, parents and loved ones to give everything and to push their caring role to the very edge of their physical and emotional endurance. I regret to say the State knows this and plays on it. We abuse their love of their dependent person because we know they will keep going. We know they will eventually become too exhausted to sustain campaigns to highlight their plight. We know they will quietly go home and we will not hear from them again until some other case hits the media or there is some other &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; expos&eacute;.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight changes urgently required to help families. Every health board should have a care manager as a point of contact for people struck by disability who would co-ordinate all services. Those struck by disability often do not know what services are available or even what services they need. They could include the provision of a wheelchair, social welfare payments, form filling and getting the required <Col N="1188"/>documents. People complain that every service seems to require individual forms to be completed. Could this not be streamlined so that at least this aspect of disability is made easier? It seems as if every application is made onerous simply to postpone the determination of eligibility.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects which one of my colleagues or I may be able to raise tomorrow night. I ask the Government to heed this motion and not to insult carers or the disabled by yet again giving us a litany of all it has done for them and all it is going to do. I ask every backbencher who has ever witnessed the despair of carers pushed to the brink, to support the motion and not to allow this scandal, which reflects on all of us, to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Government dragging its heels in publishing the disability Bill and proceeding with a programme for positive improvement in services? I cannot understand why the Government is stalling on this matter. When will the Government end the long outdated and inappropriate use of psychiatric hospitals for people with intellectual disabilities? If the Government engaged in full consultation on the disability Bill, it would enable the amended Bill to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Our motion calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) immediately bring forward the Disability Bill; and</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) at the same time, to convene a disability summit of all stakeholders in the disability movement, each of whom would be entitled to attend and participate as equal partners.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">If the resources are allocated by the Government the health boards can provide the services such as the provision of appropriate care places for people with disabilities. A brand new residential care unit in Clifden in my constituency which was completed a number of years ago, is empty and locked up because the resources to staff it have not been provided to the health board by the Government. The resources have not been provided because those with disabilities are regarded by the Government as a minority. However, many families are affected by this problem.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty the Government has placed in the way of people with disabilities is the three-year rule affecting those on employment schemes who are acting as personal assistants to people with disabilities who are living independently. As a result of this ridiculous three-year rule, many of those people must give up a personal assistant who has become used to them, has trained them and is able to assist them to live independently. Some of those people must now move into institutional care because of the ridiculous three-year rule. At the end of the three year period, <Col N="1189"/>they are forced to give up their personal assistants. It is unfortunate that I must move the Adjournment as I have a great deal more to say.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002, Dr. Michael Ryan was appointed chairman of the Civil Defence Board by the then Minister of State at the Department of Defence and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan. Speaking of the appointment at the time, Deputy Brennan indicated that he was highly delighted that people of the highest calibre had agreed to serve on the board during a very important phase in the development of the Civil Defence. Just over a year ago, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, signed the order formally establishing the board. He predicted that in a very short while the board would be in a position to take over the effective control of the organisation at national level from the Department of Defence.</P><?oasys _ah?>
    <P>It appears the Minister for Defence in pursuing decentralisation in a manner which lacks consideration or consultation has squandered the positive relationship between his Department and the board. The relationship has deteriorated to the extent that legal advice has been taken and the chairman, in whom the Minister had formerly such confidence, is being squeezed out of his position.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>On 23 April 2003, the Minister for Defence requested the Secretary General of his Department to investigate the manner in which Dr. Ryan was carrying out his duties as chairman of the Civil Defence Board. On 4 May, earlier this month, the Minister wrote to Dr. Ryan to inform him clearly and unambiguously that he was contemplating removing him from his position as chairman and revoking his membership of the board. This is indicative of the turn-about in relations between the chairman of the Civil Defence Board and the Minister for Defence. The chairman was appointed on the recommendation of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has professed his full confidence in Dr. Ryan&rsquo;s abilities. How quickly this has changed, with the Minister for Defence now taking the highly provocative action of asking his officials to trawl through the minutes of meetings of the Civil Defence board and asking people to report on telephone conversations they had with Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>While the Government has always maintained that decentralisation would be a voluntary matter for those involved, the Department of Defence <Col N="1190"/>appears to be asserting in the most adamant fashion that decentralisation of Civil Defence headquarters will go ahead without reference to the concerns of the board or the 30 or so staff who will be affected. Paramount among these concerns is the suitability of the proposed building to house headquarters. The proposed building which is located at an industrial estate on the outskirts of Roscrea has been leased by the Office of Public Works. The Civil Defence board proposes the creation of a school of civil defence offering diplomas and degree courses in emergency management. There is considerable concern that the leased building will not meet the requirements of running these courses. The decentralisation of staff from Dublin to Roscrea has run into difficulties as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s insistence on this accommodation without consulting the board. This gung-ho attitude is contrary to stated Government policy on decentralisation and may ultimately prove damaging to the operation of the Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Civil defence is often critical to the security and protection of people everywhere. With more than 6,000 volunteers under the authority of 32 Civil Defence officers, the provision of a volunteer civil defence capability is relied upon for the smooth and safe running of many events. Civil Defence volunteers offer invaluable support to the Garda and Defence Forces which should be built upon, not weakened. Unfortunately, in his haste to relocate Civil Defence headquarters to his home town, the Minister for Defence appears to have placed a much higher priority on local political advantage than on engaging in meaningful dialogue with the Civil Defence Board. The Minister must clarify his role in this matter without delay.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>It is patent nonsense to suggest there is a developing crisis within the Civil Defence Board. I am involved in a course of action on the position of its chairman and I have valid and strong reasons for embarking on this course of action. As the process is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment at this stage. I expect that the matter will come to a conclusion within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Last month, I had the pleasure of attending a major Civil Defence exercise in Sligo. In the course of my address to the Civil Defence members who had participated in the exercise, I expressed my pride in and commitment to the organisation. The Government is grateful to each member of the Civil Defence for his or her commitment and huge contribution to the organisation, local communities and the wider public.</P>
    <P>As a strong believer and advocate of the Civil Defence, I have always been of the view that the organisation must be properly equipped to carry <Col N="1191"/>out its duties. I am very pleased to say that since I became Minister for Defence in 1997, over &euro;7 million has been expended on the purchase of equipment by the Department of Defence for issue to local authorities for Civil Defence use. This equipment includes a total of 116 vehicles of all types with a total purchase value of &euro;2.6 million, protective clothing and specialised footwear to a value of over &euro;2 million and 22 inflatable boats to a value of &euro;300,000 for use in river, lake and shore rescue operations. This expenditure has been facilitated by the increase in the Civil Defence budget of &euro;635,000 per annum since 2000, as promised in the White Paper on Defence. While part of this funding has been directed to increased training grants for local authorities, the majority has been used to augment the quantity and quality of Civil Defence equipment.</P>
    <P>The invaluable assistance provided by Civil Defence volunteers in times of national crisis, including the recent foot and mouth disease threat, together with the major role played by the Civil Defence in flood relief efforts in Dublin and adjoining counties, the midlands, south and west has justifiably been recognised by the public. More recently, the extensive involvement of the Civil Defence in the Special Olympics World Games around the country and in the ceremonies at Croke Park has considerably raised the profile of the organisation. The decentralisation of Civil Defence headquarters to Roscrea is in its final stages. The organisation will be moving into its new offices during the summer.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter in the context of the serious difficulties parents of autistic children in Kilkenny and my constituency generally have had in obtaining an assessment and discovering where on the autistic spectrum their children lie. As a result, they have had to go to the great expense of attending consultants in England and in Dublin. Consultants have come to visit the families of autistic children also. It is difficult enough for families to deal with these problems at home in the absence of support and assistance from the State without having to travel across or outside the country to obtain the assessments they need to determine where children should go to school or to receive the intervention they require. Needs can be particular to the child and the family concerned.</P>
    <P>The degree of difficulty faced by these families is so great that they picketed the offices of the South Eastern Health Board some months ago to highlight their problems. Since then, they have received the same lack of response from the health board which they continually received previously. That is unacceptable. To take matters into their own hands, the parents in question have <Col N="1192"/>located a school building in Goresbridge in County Kilkenny. The structure of the building is sound.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with officials from the Department of Education and Science seeking assistance, which I attended with Mr. Marc de Salvo, they were told a comprehensive response would be given within 30 days. To date, only some queries have been answered. Last week, they were informed that some moneys would be available but not for the development of the school.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting on reports, families are suffering. It has been proven that autistic children become better at school and are at the point of entering mainstream education when assessment and intervention take place. There is an onus on the Department to be proactive in this matter and not for the information to be dragged from it. I noted at the Committee on Public Accounts that a suitable property in Myshall was passed from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Health and Children. The South Eastern Health Board has admitted the property is too far from its operations to be of use. If funding is the problem, then the health board can sell this property, ring fence the proceeds for the proposed school at Goresbridge and immediately invest the money in the development proposed by the families.</P>
    <P>The families have taken advice from all quarters on this matter. All that is needed is support from the Government and the South Eastern Health Board in order to carry out the assessments and define the supports and intervention for the children involved . The Department of Education and Science can then acknowledge that the building is sound for housing the New Horizons project in County Kilkenny. From there, it could satisfy the need for those dealing with this problem in their own time and homes.</P>
    <P>During the meeting in Athlone with departmental officials, I acknowledged the difficulties and frustrations with bureaucracy faced by these families. Will the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science remove these obstacles and give the families encouragement rather than challenges? Will the health board dispose of the property so as to fund a proper special school for autistic children in Goresbridge?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to outline to the House the position on the establishment of a special facility for children with autism at Goresbridge, County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is actively considering the application referred to by the Deputy. Officials from the Department are liaising with the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, the <Col N="1193"/>National Educational Psychological Service and the patron bodies. I can confirm that one of the officials from the Department was in recent contact with a member of the parents&rsquo; representative group. The Department confirmed that, as a matter of general policy, it is favourably disposed to making educational provision for children with autism as and when required. The details of each application have to be examined carefully, having regard to such matters as the assessment reports for the individual children, the suitability of proposed accommodation from an educational and health and safety perspective and the proximity of existing autism-specific provision in the area. The Department&rsquo;s objective would be to complete all necessary inquiries so that if the application were to be approved, the new facility would be in a position to commence operation from the start of the next school year.</P>
    <P>An official from the Department&rsquo;s technical section is arranging to examine the building proposed for the new facility in Goresbridge, County Kilkenny, this week. Pending a decision on the application, the Department has agreed to fund a structured home programme for the children concerned, subject to confirmation from the parents that the proposal is acceptable. I thank Deputy McGuinness for giving me the opportunity to clarify this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter concerning two children in the same family. The eldest child in the family waited three years to be assessed for dyslexia by the Department of Education and Science. It was a matter of concern as he was 11 years old, with one year left in national school. He was finally assessed by the Department on 30 September 2003. As a result, he was promised resource teaching of 2.5 hours per week which he has yet to receive. His assessment profile meets the primary criteria for dyslexia but he only receives learning support for 15 to 20 minutes per day for two weeks every month. He receives none of the specialised resource teaching despite the Department&rsquo;s recommendation. This will put him at a disadvantage when he enters secondary school soon. Will the Minister of State confirm there are 4,000 children in the western half of the country waiting for services already recommended by the Department?</P>
    <P>The second child, who is seven years of age, was noticed by the school to have reading problems in October 2003. The mother asked for an assessment for possible dyslexia on the grounds of his older brother&rsquo;s condition. The school informed the mother that his condition was not considered to be severe enough to warrant assessment by the Department. The school also pointed out that the child would have to be severely affected to qualify for assessment as only a certain number of children could be <Col N="1194"/>assessed. This figure, she learned, was based on the number of children attending the school and meant only 2%, or two children per year, could be assessed. This quota basis was confirmed to the mother by a departmental official for the Mayo area. If this is true, then any child falling outside the quota is simply forgotten.</P>
    <P>The mother was also informed that other children were worse-off and needed to be assessed. In the younger child&rsquo;s class alone, there were seven children requiring assessment. The mother is involved in the dyslexia workshop in Ballina. She informed me this evening that she has had to organise a private assessment for her younger son. Though the school has been helpful, the mother feels hard done by. The school has been put into a difficult situation acting as judge and jury in these cases. Parents who persist in demands for assessments feel they are hassling the school. This inequitable process needs to be changed urgently. It is leading to educational apartheid where, as the boys&rsquo; mother believes, those with money can avail of private assessments and those without cannot do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter which is of grave concern to him. I am as anxious as the Deputy to ensure there is true equality of access to psychological assessments and remedial intervention for all children with learning difficulties. The National Educational Psychological Service has made considerable investments in the provision of additional resources for children with special educational needs. The programme of the last Government contained a commitment to developing psychological services for children and young people. A planning group established to review provision in this area reported in mid-September 1998. The central recommendation in the report was the establishment of a NEPS agency under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science with a dedicated role in the development and provision of an educational psychological service and with a new organisational structure.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>Following a Government decision that approved the findings of the planning group, the NEPS agency came into being on 1 September 1999. On that date 43 Department psychologists began working in NEPS. NEPS has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need it in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department. The target staffing level recommended by the planning group is 200 psychologists. Notwithstanding the time-consuming aspects of recruiting professional staff, the Department has appointed a substantial number of additional psychologists since 1999 for assignment to NEPS. The total number of psychologists serving in NEPS is 127, <Col N="1195"/>including one on assignment to other duties in the Department of Education and Science. Four other psychologists are on career break at present, bringing the total to 131. The Department intends to continue to recruit additional psychologists to make up the shortfall as resources permit and bearing in mind the general staffing constraints at present.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>NEPS is currently in a position to provide a psychological service to most second level schools and approximately 1,760 primary schools. In Mayo, NEPS provides a service to 81.78% of all schools, serving 88.28% of pupils. Eventually, when NEPS is at full strength, its psychologists will be able to provide a full educational psychological service to all primary and post-primary schools. However, it has not been possible to expand this service to all schools at once. It is of equal importance that the development of the new agency will be done in an equitable and orderly manner while ensuring that school children are not left without essential assessment services.</P>
    <P>A draft detailed five-year expansion plan, including proposals, region by region, for the allocation of additional psychologists and for the location of NEPS offices, was approved in April 2000 by the NEPS national policy advisory board. It was inevitable that during the development period there would remain a backlog of assessment work. However, good progress has been made in general.</P>
    <P>In the case of the child referred to by the Deputy, inquiries have been made with NEPS. The school in question, Scoil Naomh Feichin, Attymass, has been in receipt of a service from NEPS since 2000. The child&rsquo;s older sibling was first referred to NEPS on 19 September 2003 and was assessed by the assigned NEPS psychologist on 30 September 2003, following which a psychological report was issued to the school. This was an exceptionally speedy response. Prior to the assessment, the psychologist met the parents and gave them direct feedback in September 2003. The older sibling is currently in receipt of learning support provision and the psychologist has recommended an extension of this provision.</P>
    <P>I understand that the teachers in the school do not consider the younger boy to be a priority for individual psychological assessment at this time. However, the fact that a child has not been assessed for dyslexia does not prevent access to the learning support service that is available to schools. The child in question is currently receiving learning support. However, it has been requested that the NEPS psychologist for the school consult the school principal and class teacher without delay and ensure that the matter is kept under review.</P><Col N="1196"/>
    <P>Learning support is the most appropriate intervention for children with specific learning disabilities. Learning support teachers have access to a variety of diagnostic tests that enable them to put an individual learning programme into place immediately. Under the current system of special education resourcing, the small number of children who fail to make progress with the learning support teacher may have access to additional resource teaching hours, provided they have been assessed by an educational psychologist as having a severe learning disability.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is aware that there have been delays for some children in accessing such individual assessments. Recently, the Department announced a move to a weighted system for the allocation of special education resources. This means that each school will be sufficiently resourced to provide automatically for children with dyslexia. This will ensure a speedy and efficient response to such difficulties. Most importantly, it will ensure that all children with have equal access to the resources they need, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances. I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter in the House.</P>

    <P LI="1">This complaint against the South Western Area Health Board in relation to a grandmother&rsquo;s entitlement to Foster Care Allowance highlights a difficulty which I understand faces many others in a similar position. I hope that by drawing attention to the matter the Oireachtas might consider alterations to the legislation.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This week the Minister announced that no such review would take place, which is a pity. The case in question is complicated and I have been dealing with it for more than two years. The person at the centre of the case had been dealing with the South Western Area Health Board for more than two years before that because of her circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is not a unique case. This problem is faced by many people, especially grandparents, in Dublin, Cork and other areas, whose relatives have succumbed to drug or alcohol addiction and are not capable of rearing their children. In many cases the children are taken into care by relatives who cannot bear to see children as young as six months old abandoned. No human being could allow this to happen. In the case to which I refer, the mother did not notice for three days that the grandmother had taken her children away. This is the type of situation we are dealing with &mdash; the <Col N="1197"/>parent or parents are incapable of caring for their children at a certain time.</P>
    <P>The problem in this case is that the children have not officially been put into the care of the health board so the relatives who have taken over the care of the children are not entitled to a fostering allowance. They must declare the children as orphans so they can receive the orphan&rsquo;s allowance, which is &euro;97 per child, while the fostering allowance is nearly three times as much. The latter also allows carers to avail of grants to provide room for the additional family members who have been imposed upon them by their children&rsquo;s circumstances. It is no mean feat for grandparents to raise a second family starting from scratch. The Child Care Act 1991 allows for fostering by relatives.</P>
    <P>I have written to the European Committee on Petitions to highlight this case because I do not believe the Ombudsman understood the circumstances fully. In this case a care worker had been assigned, which means the children were in the care of the health board. The health board disputes this, despite the existence of written proof, and we have not received a satisfactory answer.</P>
    <P>This is just one case and there are many others in which people have not even been able to receive orphan&rsquo;s allowance. Some people received two allowances and lost out when the provisions in this area were changed recently. A review of the fostering allowance and orphan&rsquo;s allowance would be appropriate so that we can start to deal with these problems effectively.</P>
    <P>The extra money these grandparents would receive through the fostering allowance would help ensure their quality of life. The family is living in a two-bedroom house with teenage sons and the husband has serious back problems. Two extra children must now live in the house. This is not abnormal. The poverty faced by grandparents in working class areas in Dublin, Cork and probably Limerick, although I have not dealt with cases in that area, is disgraceful. They should have some support. If these grandparents abandoned the children to the health board, the health board would deal with the problem and ask them to take the children in, but no family is willing to abandon young children in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address the issue and carry out a review.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is referring to the ombudsman&rsquo;s comments in her annual report in the context of an individual case brought to her attention. He also raised wider considerations. I would point out that the ombudsman did not find evidence that the health board in question had acted in an inappropriate or negligent way in this case by not <Col N="1198"/>placing the children in the care of their grandmother.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the provision of the foster care allowance, health boards are required under the Child Care Act, 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Where a child requires care or protection that he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is taken into care, the health board must take the child into its care and provide the most appropriate form of alternative care for that child. The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the health board and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11.5-?><P>In 1998, the Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children set up a working group on foster care. The task of the working group was to make recommendations on all aspects of foster care. The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group entitled Foster Care &mdash; A Child Centred Partnership. The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives. These are as follows: that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; that a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care and that placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</P>
    <P>The working group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the health boards in order to provide income support for the family in relation to the child. The group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate. Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and those in need of such support should contact that Department. The working group stated that children should only be brought into the care of the health boards if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act. In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the child&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
    <P>Under the current legislation, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster <Col N="1199"/>carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. The foster care allowance is currently paid in respect of approximately 4,000 children. This allowance was restructured in August 2001 in response to the recommendations of the working group I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of this report were made on the basis of the views strongly expressed at consultation meetings held by the working group and the views expressed by the Irish Foster Care Association. In view of the consideration <Col N="1200"/>given by the working group on foster care to the issue of relative care, my Department has no current plans to review the Child Care Act, 1991 or the Child Care Regulations, 1995.</P>
    <P>Payment of the orphans allowance or pension is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. These payments are made directly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, normally to the child&rsquo;s guardian. The circumstances in which these payments are made and the level of payment are determined by that Department.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 55 and 113 together.</P>
    <P>Following the appointment of Mr. Justice Sean Ryan as chairperson designate of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Government requested that he carry out his own independent review of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. This report, together with a review of the operations of the commission carried out by the Attorney General, were published on 15 January 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted the recommendations in Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report for legislative amendments to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000. My Department is in ongoing contact with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in connection with this matter and work on the drafting of legislation amending the Act is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Amendments envisaged in Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report that will be made to the legislation include: (1) the removal of the obligation on the committee to hear each allegation of abuse made to it; (2) a provision to allow for joint hearings to <Col N="1202"/>take place; (3) provision for single member division of a committee; (4) removal of the provision whereby the report of the investigative committee may not contain findings in relation to particular instances of allegations of abuse; and (5) the right of complainant to withdraw a complaint subject to the consent of the committee.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report the commission has held meetings with all interested parties, including the Department of Education and Science and representative groups, to facilitate them in expressing their views in relation to the content of both reports and to enable them to make suggestions in relation to the future operation of the investigation committee of the commission.</P>
    <P>As part of that ongoing consultation process, on 7 May 2004 the commission hosted an open meeting at which it presented a position paper entitled &ldquo;Identifying Institutions and Persons under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000&rdquo; and a document entitled &ldquo;Background to Events Surrounding the Reconstitution of the Investigation Committee&rdquo;. This and other related documents are available from the commission&rsquo;s website at <i>www.childabusecommission.ie</i>. The main question posed in the document is whether the investigation committee should name individual abusers.</P>
    <P>The commission announced that a formal hearing of the investigation committee is being scheduled for 24 May 2004 to receive submissions on the matter. Representative groups will also be given an opportunity to express their views and to discuss the matter subsequent to this hearing.</P>
    <P>The commission then intends to give this matter further consideration and to issue its final decision by mid-June. It will also inform Government at that stage whether it recommends further legislative amendments.</P>
    <P>While work on the amending legislation is at an advanced stage it is not possible to publish the amending legislation in advance of the investigation committee decision on the naming of individual abusers or the Christian Brothers appeal to the Supreme Court. The court hearing is scheduled for 29 and 30 June 2004. Therefore, the earliest the court will deliver its decision will be in July 2004. Consequently, it is not envisaged that amending legislation can be published before September 2004. I would add that the chairperson of the commission has indicated that the investigation committee intends to resume hearings in advance of amending legislation being enacted. In this regard the commission has published a schedule of hearings in relation to a number of individual institutions and has indicated that it expects to commence hearings in respect of the first institution in July of this year.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. Since 1997 almost &euro;2 billion has been invested in the school building programme at primary and post-primary level, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. This is a very significant amount of investment. This level of investment will need to be maintained if the goal of eliminating substandard accommodation is to be achieved. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.</P>
    <P>The budget announcement regarding multiannual capital envelopes is further evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment and will enable me to adopt a multiannual framework for the school building programme. It will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of individual projects in accordance with set standards.</P>
    <P>The standards to be employed derive from the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools published by my Department. These planning guidelines are available to schools and set out the detailed standards for modernisation that can be employed by design teams working on school building projects. The guidelines are reviewed regularly in order to secure best value for money in relation to educational requirements and architectural design. Technical guidance documents in relation to design and other requirements are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The interim phase of the employee assistance service for teachers concluded its operation in August 2003.</P>
    <P>A review of the interim phase was considered by the steering committee responsible for overseeing the operation of the service. The <Col N="1204"/>steering committee concluded that the current service arrangements should not be extended beyond the scheduled end of the interim phase in August 2003. The committee considered that there was a need for a more fundamental review of the objectives and remit of an employee assistance service for teachers and the preparation of a blueprint for the future development of such a service.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering possible options to advance this issue in the context of available resources. While I am supportive of the principle of an employee assistance service I feel that we should not rush to mainstream this service until we have identified the most beneficial and cost effective model of delivery. I have asked my officials to look at different models of delivery and to talk further with the union and management interests on the best way forward. Discussions with these interests will take place shortly.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>further to Question No. 12 of 19 February 2004, in reply to which he stated that Adamstown was a separate entity to Lucan, if this means there are plans to set up a new second level school within the Lucan area as opposed to opening an existing designated Adamstown site earlier; and if the position remains that students who cannot obtain a co-educational, single sex or other place in the Lucan area will have to attend schools in Palmerstown, Clondalkin and Leixlip.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14381/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The position in the matter to which the Deputy refers is as I outlined to the House in February 2004. The educational infrastructural needs of the Adamstown area as it develops are separate and distinct from those of the Lucan area and clearly cannot alleviate any current difficulties that may exist in the Lucan area.</P>
    <P>Swift and decisive actions have been taken to address the demands that have emerged from the rapid development of Lucan over recent years. Within the last five years a total sum of &euro;19 million has been invested in providing and upgrading educational provision in Lucan, &euro;12 million at primary level and &euro;7 million at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>This expansion is set to continue with three new schools due to commence construction this year, two at primary level and one at post-primary level. Specifically at post-primary level, a new school for Col&aacute;iste Cois Life will proceed to tender and construction this year. This will provide places for 600 pupils, some 400 additional places relative to existing capacity.</P>
    <P>Capacity at Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig will be increased by 300 pupil places with the completion of the major extension project at the school. A further extension project at St. Joseph&rsquo;s College will also be completed this year, which will provide an <Col N="1205"/>overall capacity of 725 pupil places. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area.</P>
    <P>With regard to pupils from the Lucan area attending schools in areas such as Palmerstown and Leixlip, the position is that it is the current practice, particularly in Dublin, that post-primary students tend to travel some distance to attend a post-primary school. It is therefore not unreasonable that my Department should seek to optimise the use of existing surplus capacity at post-primary schools in the general vicinity of Lucan as part of a range of measures to address any shortfall for post-primary places that may emerge in Lucan.</P>
    <P>In summary, on foot of this unprecedented level of investment in schools in the Lucan area, pupil places will be increased overall by 25% over a period of five to six years. Accordingly, I am satisfied that my Department has been dealing in a comprehensive way with the needs of this developing area. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to review demographic change in the area.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the number of outstanding applications for special educational resources that are waiting to be assessed by his Department; the number of applications that have been processed since the start of 2004; the length of time it has taken to process these applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department received more than 8,400 applications for special education resources since 15 February 2003. The batch of approximately 5,000 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. Priority was given to almost 1,000 cases involving children starting school last September and all those cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications in that batch has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. Those applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of such provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to <Col N="1207"/>achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school. In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: (a) making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and (b) making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will: reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended also that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>

The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule for the coming school year issued to all primary schools in April 2004.</P>
    <P>Some 246 schools are due to have the number of approved mainstream teaching posts reduced for the 2004-05 school year as a result of the application of the staffing schedule. Some 73 of the schools concerned have been designated as disadvantaged. For the 2004-05 school year, I <Col N="1208"/>have decided that the determination by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2003 of teacher posts allocated for disadvantage will remain unchanged. Some 311 designated disadvantaged schools have 293 concessionary teaching posts, which are not determined by reference to enrolment. Some 32 schools are considered for staffing at a pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. Some 209 schools are considered for staffing at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. Details of the number of schools gaining or losing posts by reference to enrolment in these schools are currently being finalised and I will ask my officials to forward this information to the Deputy when it is available. A detailed review of educational disadvantage schemes is nearing completion and this will impact on existing schemes. The outcome of this review will be announced in due course.</P>

	<P>In fulfilment of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackle substandard school accommodation the level of capital investment in schools over the lifetime of this Government has progressively increased since 1998 to a total of almost &euro;2 billion, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to any school or category of school, including schools that may be participating in such as the early start programme, is that their needs must be processed as part of the overall programme and must be assessed individually within the published prioritisation criteria.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware this year my Department&rsquo;s school building programme of &euro;388 million will deliver in excess of 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary level. In excess of 200 of these projects will commence on site in the current year, the remaining projects had commenced in previous years and are currently nearing completion. Furthermore, approximately an additional 600 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme directly by means of temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation and/or improvement works and all primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing my Department is how to ensure the State gets best return on investment in educational infrastructure. New ways such as the devolved building initiative for small rural schools and the permanent accommodation <Col N="1209"/>initiative, both initiated in 2003 and expanded this year, show the Department&rsquo;s commitment to finding innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy.</P>
    <P>My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under-investment in school infrastructure. The announcement in the last budget in relation to a multiannual capital envelope will greatly assist my Department in addressing school accommodation needs in a programmed and systematic way.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the original agreements and understanding reached when the 16 comprehensive schools were established did not provide for parent and teacher representation on the boards of management. Clearly, this is an unacceptable position and my Department has been working for a number of years with the following interested parties, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Jesuit Community, the National Parent Council &mdash; Post-Primary, the IVEA and the teacher unions to bring about a change. Agreement on the revised composition of the boards took a considerable time to achieve, but I am glad to say that three discrete models have been produced, one for the ten Catholic comprehensives, one for the five Protestant comprehensives and one for the Jesuit comprehensive. A common feature of the new arrangements is the inclusion on the board of two parents and two teachers in each case.</P>
    <P>While these are State schools, they were established by the State in the context of agreements and understandings reached with the church interests, at the time, regarding their operation. Therefore, the precise composition of each board in terms of the balance of interests represented did not start from a blank canvass. For example, the revised board in the case of the <Col N="1210"/>Protestant comprehensives includes six church nominees in an overall board of 11. This arose because the Church of Ireland felt unable to agree to any revised composition that did not enshrine a majority for it on the board, as was the case when the schools were first established.</P>
    <P>The present position is that, as the schools were established by formal agreements, it is necessary to revise all relevant existing legal instruments to reflect the inclusion of parent and teacher representatives, as agreed. This work is completed in the case of the Jesuit school in Limerick and a revised legal instrument has been signed. It is my understanding that the new board is now in place there. In the case of the other schools, work is ongoing with the legal representatives of the Catholic and Protestant churches and a response is awaited from the church interests to proposals made by my officials as the basis for amending the relevant texts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this process has been lengthy. I am very anxious to have the matter finalised as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy will appreciate that, while the State established the schools concerned, I as Minister, have the power to appoint and remove the existing boards. I want, however, to proceed in a manner that is faithful to the original agreements with the churches and to appoint new boards only when the agreements have been formally revised. Given co-operation by all parties concerned, I believe the new school year is a realistic target for implementation of the new board structures.</P>

Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory or inspection function in the operation of these facilities to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was limited due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time consuming and is continuing.

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>his plans to improve primary education facilities throughout the country with particular reference to areas of social and economic deprivation and with the objective of ensuring that all children leaving the primary education system are in a position to compete on an equal footing in respect of further education and employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. By ensuring that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged <Col N="1212"/>people in the education system at all levels, my objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government&rsquo;s national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003-2005, NAPS/incl. and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. At primary school level, my Department has provided &euro;73 million in 2004 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the strategies outlined in the NAPS/incl. and Sustaining Progress. These programmes include the disadvantaged area scheme, the home school community liaison scheme and the giving children an even break, GCEB, programme.</P>
    <P>The home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme is concerned with establishing partnership and collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of the child&rsquo;s learning. All 314 primary schools with designated disadvantaged status were invited to join this scheme in 1999.</P>
    <P>Under the giving children an even break programme, 2,350 participating schools are benefiting from a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school.</P>
    <P>Other measures directed towards the support of primary school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds include the reading recovery programme and the book grant scheme. The school completion programme and the National Educational Welfare Board, both of which operate at primary and post-primary levels, also play a crucial role in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of schemes provided by other Departments that support primary pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds such as the school meals scheme and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme. My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes and I will make an announcement in this regard once the review has been completed.</P>
    <P>The school building programme for 2004 is further testimony to this Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to addressing the historical educational infrastructural deficit. The programme provides for an unprecedented level of investment of some &euro;387 million in providing new and upgraded schools around the country. By the end of this year, in excess of &euro;2 billion will have been expended in modernising schools since 1997.</P>

	<P>The early start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. The aims of early start are to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in early start is to establish groups of 15 pupils in existing primary schools in disadvantaged areas, with each class being run by a primary school teacher and a qualified child care worker. While the early start curriculum emphasises the development of cognitive and language skills, due regard is also had to personal and social development. The early start service has not been expanded since 1995. In relation to future development of early childhood education provision for disadvantaged children, my Department, as part of a detailed review of educational disadvantage programmes, is currently exploring how such provision should best be delivered in the future. I am particularly concerned to ensure that any future actions by my Department in this area are based on a collaborative approach with other Departments involved in the overall early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector. Meeting the overall objective of providing the best possible service to the communities and children involved requires that any educational provision by my Department takes account of child care measures under the remit of other Departments.</P>
    <P>The future development of the early start pre-school project is being considered as part of this process and I will make an announcement in this regard as soon as the detailed review of all initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage has been completed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1998 almost &euro;2 billion has been invested in the school building programme at primary and post-primary level, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. This is a significant amount of investment. This level of investment will need to be maintained if the goal of eliminating sub-standard accommodation is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The 2004 school building programme, which I published last December, is a further major step <Col N="1214"/>in progressing this Government&rsquo;s consistent commitment since 1997 to deal with school accommodation needs. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give assurance that the building programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>The level of capital funding being provided at primary and post-primary level in 2004 amounts to &euro;388 million; in excess of &euro;200 million of this will be targeted at primary level projects. The programme details in excess of 260 significant school building projects that are being authorised to proceed to tender and construction in 2004, including the completion of major projects commenced before 2004.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been provided in the 2004 programme to allow for a major expansion of the sites acquisition programme, at a cost of &euro;32 million, the continuation of the asbestos and radon remediation programmes, &euro;17 million, and the provision of temporary accommodation. Payment will be made to all schools of the devolved grant of &euro;3,809 and &euro;12.70 per pupil. This will cost in the region of &euro;19 million.</P>
    <P>A key part of my strategy going forward will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multiannual allocations for capital investment in education projects covering the years 2004 to 2008. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multiannual building programme from 2005 onwards. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.</P>
    <P>An innovative feature of the 2004 programme is the introduction of a new initiative for capital grants for smaller scale improvement works for both primary and post-primary schools. The new initiative, known as the summer works scheme, is designed to fund smaller scale works to those schools that are most in need of resources. An advantage of this scheme is that successful applicants were informed by early March, if their projects would receive funding, allowing them to plan and carry out works during the summer months. A total of &euro;31 million was set aside for projects included in the summer works scheme and in excess of 450 schools have been given sanction to carry out building works in summer 2004 under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Education and Science I have been anxious to give school authorities as much power as possible in managing their own building programmes. In 2003 I introduced two pilot schemes to allow small primary schools to undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis; this new scheme is another example of that approach. This approach is being continued in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has <Col N="1215"/>already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued, as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the survey, conducted by the ASTI, referred to by the Deputy. It is important that while acknowledging that student discipline is an issue in schools we do not talk this up to being a crisis. It is undoubtedly the case that a small proportion of students cause serious problems in schools. The reasons for this are not simple and are societal as much as educational. That said, I do not think that today&rsquo;s generation of young people is more disruptive than their predecessors. The reality is that as we have progressively increased the retention rate in our formal education system we are retaining students who in the past would have dropped out of school early. This poses challenges for schools and for society. There are no simple answers or magic wands available here.</P>
    <P>A school&rsquo;s code of discipline and the inclusive way in which it is framed is important, particularly in harnessing student and parental support. We also have to look at whether the formal school model best meets the needs of all students and whether other models need to be developed. As against this we have to be careful not to promote the exclusion of problem students as this will leave us with a greater problem down the road.</P>

	<P>I am concerned about the position of imbalance between male and female applicants for the primary teaching profession. My Department commissioned a research study on the issue of take-up of primary teacher training by males and females. The report on the study, which was completed in 2002, showed that the pool of males with the necessary qualifications is smaller than the equivalent pool of females. In addition, many third level course choices seemed to be gender stereotyped and significantly more girls were attracted to teaching of all kinds. The authors concluded that it may be difficult for any society to bring about an early reversal of the feminisation trends in teaching. I have established a primary education committee which is working under the auspices of the gender equality unit of my Department and is looking at the concerns about the numbers of males entering the primary teaching profession. I have asked the committee to make recommendations on strategies and initiatives to increase the number of males entering primary teaching. I understand that the INTO report on gender imbalance in primary teaching, which was published at Easter 2004, and the requirement of a C grade in higher level leaving certificate Irish has formed part of the deliberations of the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee first met in October 2003 and is expected to submit to me shortly an interim report of its considerations to date. I look forward to receiving the final report by late autumn 2004.</P>

	<P>The joint working group on teachers superannuation, set up on foot of a decision of the North-South Ministerial Council, is examining the feasibility and implication of establishing reciprocal arrangements to facilitate the transfer of pension entitlements between the jurisdictions. As part of the working group&rsquo;s consideration of a range of complex issues involved, the group asked actuaries on both sides to examine the financial implication of the possible approach to cross-Border transfer of teaching service.</P><Col N="1218"/>
    <P>It is expected that the actuaries will present a preliminary report to the next meeting of the working group. The meeting, scheduled to take place on 18 May, has had to be deferred due to the unavailability of some representatives from Northern Ireland on that date. It is planned to reschedule the meeting for early June on a date yet to be agreed. The unavailability of the representatives arises as a consequence of ongoing industrial action by some civil servants in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my previous reply on this matter on 19 February last, I explained that the working group is very much aware that the superannuation of teachers cannot be considered in isolation, and that any proposals for the transfer of pension entitlements will have to take account of the implications for the public service generally. In view of the range of considerations to be taken into account by the working group, it is not possible at this stage to say when the group will complete its work.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 171 together.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and secondary schools which are privately owned. I believe that it would not be reasonable to expect the State to meet the full insurance costs of privately owned buildings.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I also hold the view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of secondary schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would meet the cost. Such an approach would also reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks.</P>
    <P>I am committed to improving the funding position of secondary schools in the light of available resources. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of primary and secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary schools the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57 in 1997 to &euro;121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. In the case of <Col N="1220"/>secondary schools, the standard <i>per</i> <i>capita</i> grant now amounts to &euro;274 from 1 January last as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. In the case of disadvantaged schools, such as the school referred to by the Deputy, this increase has brought the total <i>per</i> <i>capita</i> grant to &euro;312. In addition, the support grant that was introduced under the school services support initiative, was also increased from 1 January last and now stands at &euro;131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school per annum that was approved in December 2001. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to &euro;108,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the T&aacute;naiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the T&aacute;naiste has announced a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the undertaking of a joint study into insurance in conjunction with the Competition Authority and other initiatives in association with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>By ensuring that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels, my objective is to ensure that all young people complete first and second level with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.</P>
    <P>In the area of further and adult education the principal objectives of the measures and programmes funded by my Department are: to meet the needs of young early school leavers; to provide second chance education for adults; and to provide vocational education and training for labour market entrants and re-entrants.</P>
    <P>These objectives are pursued through such programmes as Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme, post-leaving certificate courses, senior Traveller training, the back to education initiative and the adult literacy and community education scheme. The <Col N="1221"/>programmes are operated and managed by the vocational education committees. Issues of access for individuals are addressed at local level with assistance from the adult education guidance service.</P>
    <P>In higher education, there is provision for a third level access fund totalling &euro;121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation of: students from disadvantaged backgrounds; mature students; and students with disabilities. The third level access fund comprises the following funding measures: special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students; the ESF-aided student assistance fund; the ESF-aided fund for students with disabilities; and the ESF-aided millennium partnership fund for disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In 2003, I introduced a new package of measures, costing &euro;42 million in a full year, to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combined substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</P>

	<P>The report by ESRI-NCCA examines the experiences of students in their first year at post-primary school. It shows that although students have both positive and negative feelings about moving to a new school, most students settle into post-primary school quickly.</P>
    <P>Among the findings in the report are the possible negative effects that streaming of students by ability may have on how students settle into school. It is encouraging that the research indicates that the prevalence of streaming in first year is declining, and that the great majority, 70%, of schools surveyed used mixed ability classes in first year with 16% using banding and only 14% using streaming.</P>
    <P>We should keep in mind that streaming can take different forms and that sometimes different ability groupings may be helpful for the individual pupils at a later stage in their education. For example various syllabi are available at higher, ordinary and foundation levels and it may be appropriate for classes to be organised along these lines.</P>
    <P>Schools have a certain amount of latitude in how they organise their classes, and this is essentially an organisational issue for principals <Col N="1222"/>and school boards of management. The school development planning initiative, supported by a full-time support service, has an important role in achieving the best organisational arrangement for all pupils.</P>
    <P>In general, the view of my Department is that mixed-ability classes are preferable, particularly in first year. This issue is dealt with through provision by the second level support service of whole school in-service on mixed ability teaching, through the work under the school development planning initiative, through the ongoing work of the inspectorate in evaluation and quality enhancement, and through dissemination of the findings of the ESRI-NCCA report. An information leaflet for schools and parents summarising the key findings and recommendations of the research has been launched and this will inform school practice and planning.</P>

	<P>My Department has recently issued a circular, primary circular 02/04 seniority of primary teachers, to boards of management, principal teachers and all teaching staff in primary schools setting out the arrangements for determining seniority of teachers in primary schools and the responsibilities of the boards of management in this regard. The terms of the circular were agreed between my Department, school managerial representatives and teacher representatives.</P>
    <P>The issue of the seniority of a principal teacher who relinquishes his or her post was also clarified in the circular. A principal teacher can only relinquish a post of principal teacher provided there is a permanent vacancy in the school. When a principal teacher relinquishes the post of principal she or he becomes the most junior teacher in the school. Previous service given as a principal in the school does not count for seniority purposes.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The staffing schedule governing the appointment and retention of mainstream class teachers is finalised for a particular year following discussions between officials from my Department and the education partners.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to change the arrangements for the application of the staffing schedule and the operation of redeployment panels. Under these arrangements, if the enrolment figure in a <Col N="1223"/>school falls below the retention figure a mainstream class post is suppressed and the most junior teacher in the school can opt to have his or her name placed on the panel for redeployment to another school.</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy that I share the concern implicit in his question that the use of educationally linked promotions should not exploit schools pupils and their parents.</P>
    <P>In the commercial world, private companies are free to promote their businesses in accordance with accepted marketing practices, such as the provision of vouchers which can be redeemed for a variety of purposes. There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and potential customers. I recognise the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of requiring additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives. The discretion of management in individual schools is the appropriate mechanism to avoid the excesses raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Youth Work Act 2001 was enacted on 1 December 2001 and provides a statutory basis for the development of youth work in Ireland.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 74 and 87 together.</P>
    <P>The provision for credits and exemptions given by certain UK colleges for learning undertaken <Col N="1226"/>in post leaving certificate courses is on foot of individual decisions made by those colleges, rather than on the basis of any nationally established system.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the higher education links scheme provides recognition for holders of FETAC, NCVA level two, full awards and provides access to an extensive range of courses in the institutes of technology. More recently the institutes have been seeking to expand the scheme for more general entry and a number of universities have opened up progression opportunities to designated courses. In general the scheme allows for access, but not exemptions.</P>
    <P>Higher education institutions in Ireland participate in the European credit transfer system which provides for transfer of recognition of learning at levels within the higher education system in participating colleges across Europe. The system is generally aimed at students studying for part of their programme in a college abroad and does not apply to the non-tertiary sector.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that provision for credit transfer and for recognition of prior learning are important in supporting learner mobility and lifelong learning, and that there is a need for an overarching approach which will ensure compatibility and progression for learners across both vocational education and training and higher education. With that objective in mind, on foot of a Copenhagen declaration adopted at European level in November 2002, an EU technical working group has been established to co-ordinate implementation of developments in this area, and Ireland is represented on this by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. The work under way aims to develop a practical working model for a European credit transfer system for vocational education and training which will be compatible with the European credit transfer system which applies in higher education.</P>
    <P>These transnational developments will take some years to come to fruition. In an Irish context, a single national framework of qualifications was launched last October which includes all learning from initial schooling and basic education and training to doctorate level. The framework is now the single nationally and internationally accepted entity through which all learning achievements may be measured and related to each other in a coherent way, and it defines the relationship between all education and training awards. The framework places awards at particular levels within the system thus facilitating progression to further levels of learning. Among the next steps, over the period to 2006, are for the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Councils to finalise and apply the new arrangements governing the implementation of the framework in collaboration with stakeholders, to ensure that legacy awards are placed in the framework and that existing and new programmes are adapted as <Col N="1227"/>necessary for inclusion in the new framework. This implementation process is well advanced in relation to higher education and training. As the range of qualifications involved in further education and training is very broad, the changes taking place will require some time to reach completion. When fully implemented the new system will provide for accumulation of modular credits towards an award and for the recognition of prior learning.</P>
    <P>The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council are also working with qualification and regulatory agencies in Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland with the aim of exploring how mutual recognition of qualifications and progression pathways for learners on these islands can be enhanced.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. By ensuring that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels, my objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.</P>
    <P>One of my key concerns is to improve the level of synergy between the various disadvantaged programmes operated by my Department. To this end, my Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes and I will be making an announcement in this regard once the review has been completed.</P>

	<P>As part of its evaluative role, my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate conducted a sample survey, in late 2002, of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular <Col N="1228"/>reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</P>
    <P>The report expressed concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, although it emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over-identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</P>
    <P>Arising from the findings in the report, subsequent applications for special educational resources have been subject to individual verification. In addition, my Department is reviewing the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.</P>
    <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate and educational services together with a further eight head office staff. To date, 66 service delivery staff have been appointed. This figure is comprised of 53 educational welfare officers, nine senior educational welfare officers and four regional managers. It includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers to be very important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the full. As I have stated previously, I consider it essential that the board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with the personnel it has at the moment and with the help of other people involved in the area. When this has been achieved, I will consider the position again taking into account the available resources.</P>
    <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which <Col N="1231"/>are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>

The 2004 programme has been presented in a user friendly way to enable all interested parties to establish information in relation to the capital development of schools. In addition to information on individual schools, the school building programme also outlines details of the different schemes and includes a guide to the prioritisation of large-scale building projects at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
    <P>A new initiative for capital grants for small-scale improvements works for both primary and post-primary schools was launched also this year.

	<P>At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law and was not related to financial considerations.</P>
    <P>I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. I understand from the liquidator that he has extended the period of notice of redundancy for the staff to 21 May 2004. Officials from my Department met with all members of staff of ITE in December 2003. A further meeting was held on 12 May 2004 between my Department, ITE staff and their union representatives.</P>
    <P>My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and is working closely with the liquidator in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.</P>

	<P>An application for a second gaelscoil in Lucan was received in my Department in January last. In accordance with established procedures, the application was referred to the new schools advisory committee for its assessment and recommendation. The NSAC reported to me and my decisions regarding the recognition of new schools for September 2004 were based on that report.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that any increasing demand for all-Irish provision in the Lucan area can be met by expanding existing provision. Accordingly, I made the decision not to grant recognition to a second gaelscoil in Lucan.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the issues raised by the INTO in relation to class size at primary level. The staffing of a primary school is determined by <Col N="1234"/>reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular school year following discussions between my officials and the education partners. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2002-2003 school year. The staffing schedule for the current school year is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The pupil teacher ratio at primary level has improved significantly in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 18.0:1 in the 2002-03 school year. The projected ratio for the current school year is 17.44:1.</P>
    <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear at every opportunity that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels.</P>
    <P>Some 311 designated disadvantaged schools have 293 concessionary teaching posts, which are not determined by reference to enrolment. Class sizes in 32 schools are considered for staffing with reduced pupil teacher ratios of 15:1 in junior and 27:1 in senior classes and 209 schools are considered for staffing with reduced pupil teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. These ratios remain unchanged for the 2004-05 school year.</P>
    <P>In 2003 more than &euro;70 million was provided by my Department for disadvantaged programmes at primary level, aimed at ensuring that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are given the opportunity to maximise their potential within the education system.</P>
    <P>A detailed review of education disadvantage schemes is nearing completion and this will impact on existing schemes. I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act was enacted on 10 April 2002. The Act provided for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board in order to provide a mechanism to make financial awards to victims of abuse to assist them in their recovery and enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives. It also provided an alternative to them having to pursue traumatic civil court cases in order to obtain compensation for their injuries.</P>
    <P>While the civil courts operate on the basis that a plaintiff must prove their case on the balance of probability, the redress board operates on a much lower threshold of proof and does not make any findings of guilt in relation to an individual or an institution.</P>
    <P>I assume that the issues the Deputy is referring to are around the recent case of a person dissatisfied with the outcome of the redress process. This person has taken the option to recommencing his case in the courts. The Government has agreed to do everything it possibly can to expedite a hearing and, taking into account the papers already lodged for the purpose of the civil case, to agree that the case will proceed on an assessment of damages only basis.</P>
    <P>The operation of the redress board and review committee must be viewed objectively and adverse judgments regarding the process should not be made on the basis of just one case. To date a total of 3,540 applications have been made to the redress board and the application process has been finalised in 1,070 of these cases. The remaining cases are at various stages of the process. This indicates a high level of satisfaction with the operation of the board and the process of redress. In the circumstances I do not see a requirement to bring forward amendments to legislation which is working to the benefit of the vast majority of survivors.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special needs will have relevant training and continuing professional development.</P>
    <P>I have authorised a major expansion in the range of postgraduate training for teachers working with pupils with special needs in four colleges of education and UCD. In addition, I have authorised the introduction of a range of new training programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas. I have also established <Col N="1236"/>a special education support service, headquartered in the Laois Education Centre, to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The service is currently developing training teams to deliver training in specific areas. In addition, the service supports a range of local initiatives including the use of e-learning which provides courses on-line during the school year.</P>
    <P>My Department allocates resource posts and special needs assistant posts to first and second level schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. In the case of first level schools, the 350 special needs teacher posts that I announced recently will be allocated as part of a new weighted system of teacher support for such pupils. This new weighted system will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs. Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests.</P>
    <P>In the case of second level schools, applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities.

    <P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>Since September 2000, the implementation of SPHE in post-primary schools has been supported by the post-primary SPHE support service, in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. Support has been offered to all schools and <Col N="1237"/>training in the delivery of SPHE at junior cycle has been provided to more than 4,300 teachers to date. All post-primary schools are required to have SPHE timetabled as part of their school curriculum, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s circular M11/03, with effect from September 2003.</P>
    <P>Under action 43 of the national drugs strategy, guidelines for developing a school substance use policy were developed by the Department of Education and Science in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. These guidelines were issued to all schools in May 2002 to assist them in the development of substance use policies. The individual school&rsquo;s substance use policy is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and dealing with relevant issues in a planned and considered way.</P>

	<P>On the basis of the most recent information available from the Residential Institutions Redress Board, the board has received 3,540 applications. To date, the board has completed the process in 1,070 cases. The average award is approximately &euro;80,000. The board provides regular updates as to the number of claims received on its website, <i>www.rirb.ie.</i> I have received the board&rsquo;s first annual report and I am making arrangements for it to be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the redress board, my Department had estimated that there would be approximately 5,000 applicants to the board. It is too early to determine what the final outcome will be at this stage of the process. However, the redress board in its annual report anticipates receiving between 6,500 and 7,000 applications in the three year period for acceptance of applications. The board bases this on information supplied by a number of the solicitors who have presented the most applications to date. The board recognises that this estimate is tentative as there are no precedents for the redress scheme.</P>

     <Quest>his plans to address increasing instances in schools of teachers encountering students under the influence of alcohol or drugs; if his attention has been drawn to the recent ASTI survey on general disciplinary problems in schools here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the survey, conducted by the ASTI, referred to by the Deputy. While education has a role in addressing the problem of the misuse of substances, particularly alcohol misuse, effecting change in this area also depends on consistent support from the drinks industry, parents and society as a whole. A responsible attitude to the promotion of alcohol, especially in targeting young people, and ensuring rigorous implementation of the law on legal age limits regarding the sale of alcohol are an essential part of this approach. Parents also have a responsibility in helping children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours. In general the community as a whole needs to reflect on the general attitude to the misuse of substances.</P>
    <P>Schools can play an active role in addressing the problems and consequences of the misuse of substances through the SPHE, social, personal and health education, curriculum which focuses on developing an informed and sensible attitude to substances. Through the SPHE curriculum, students are enabled to develop a framework for responsible and informed decision making about their health, personal lives and social development. In particular, the substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in relation to their lives.</P>
    <P>All post-primary schools were required to implement the SPHE curriculum as part of the junior cycle core curriculum from September 2003. The 2003-04 return of pupil information from 743 post-primary schools indicates that all post-primary schools are complying with this requirement. Ongoing support in the implementation of SPHE continues to be provided to schools through the post-primary SPHE support service, which is a partnership between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>Supports are also being provided to schools through the SPHE support service for the development of their substance use policies within which alcohol can be addressed alongside tobacco and drugs. Guidelines for developing a school substance use policy were prepared by my Department together with the Department of <Col N="1239"/>Health and Children and the health boards and circulated to schools in 2002 in accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy. The central objective of a school substance use policy is the welfare, care, protection and education of every young person. The school policy can ensure schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and managing issues relating to substance misuse, including alcohol misuse, in a planned and considered way. In 2002, schools were asked by my Department to engage with the process of developing their substance use policies, if they were not already engaged with this process or if they did not have one in place already.</P>
    <P>It is important that while acknowledging that student discipline is an issue in schools we do not talk this up to being a crisis. It is undoubtedly the case that a small proportion of students cause serious problems in schools. The reasons for this are not simple and are societal as much as educational. That said, I do not think that today&rsquo;s generation of young people is more disruptive than their predecessors. The reality is that as we have progressively increased the retention rate in our formal education system we are retaining students who in the past would have dropped out of school early. This poses challenges for schools and for society. There are no simple answers or magic wands available here.</P>
    <P>A school&rsquo;s code of discipline and the inclusive way in which it is framed is important, particularly in harnessing student and parental support. We also have to look at whether the formal school model best meets the needs of all students and whether other models need to be developed. As against this we have to be careful not to promote the exclusion of problem students as this will leave us with a greater problem down the road.</P>

	<P>Since 1998 almost &euro;2 billion has been invested in the school building programme at both primary and post-primary levels, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. This year&rsquo;s school building programme at &euro;388 million is the largest in the history of the State. It will deliver more than 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary level. Some 209 of these projects are new starts in the current year, the balance have been carried forward from previous years. In addition, more than 570 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
    <P>This level of investment will need to be maintained if the goal of eliminating sub-standard accommodation is to be achieved. The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and to consolidating the <Col N="1241"/>substantial progress already made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.</P>
    <P>The introduction, for the first time, of multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to address schools modernisation needs in a planned and coherent manner. All projects not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the issues to which the Deputy refers relate to the recent case of a person who went on hunger strike as he was dissatisfied with the outcome of the redress process. This person has ceased his hunger strike and has taken the option of recommencing his case in the courts. The Government has agreed to do everything it possibly can to expedite a hearing and, taking into account the papers already lodged for the purpose of the civil case, has agreed that the case will proceed on an assessment of damages only basis.</P>
    <P>The operation of the redress board and review committee must be viewed objectively and adverse judgments regarding the process should not be made on the basis of just one case. To date a total of 3,540 applications have been made to the redress board and the application process has been finalised in 1,070 of these cases. The remaining cases are at various stages of the process. This indicates a high level of satisfaction with the operation of the board and the process of redress.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I do not see a requirement to review legislation which is working to the benefit of the vast majority of survivors.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent survey of more than 400 primary and secondary schools that shows that waiting time for psychological assessments is well over six months; his views on whether this is an unacceptably lengthy waiting time; his plans to address shortening waiting times for children in need of psychological assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My attention has been drawn to the survey quoted and I have made inquiries about the current situation.</P>
    <P>My Department established the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in 1999 for a number of reasons, including concerns that many children did not have access at that time to psychological assessments. NEPS is not yet up to full strength, but my Department is committed to expanding the service as laid down in the Government decision of February 1999.</P>
    <P>At present, there are three main routes by which school-going children may obtain psychological assessments. All schools have access to either the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS or to the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, which is funded by my Department. Sanction for a further year of SCPA was renewed in January 2004. In some circumstances, children may be referred for assessment to the psychological services of the health boards or voluntary bodies under their aegis. It is not clear if the survey refers to all these services or to those in the education sector or to NEPS alone.</P>
    <P>Experience in other jurisdictions shows that, in terms of value for money, a psychological service is most effective if it engages in support and development work in schools, particularly in programmes that prevent school failure. My Department&rsquo;s policy is that the main responsibility for assessment and remedial work is that of the school and is carried out by teachers in collaboration with psychologists. School-based assessment can be speedily arranged. The main role of the psychologist is to advise teachers on the choice of tests, to help them to interpret test results and to develop individualised learning plans. NEPS psychologists carry out individual assessments only if the school&rsquo;s interventions have not been effective over a period of time and/or if the child needs additional resources or <Col N="1243"/>facilities. This is known as the staged model of assessment.</P>
    <P>NEPS psychologists therefore do not keep waiting lists in the sense of lists of pupils referred in chronological order. They prioritise assessment work in consultation with the schools. It is not clear if the survey refers to pupils who have been prioritised by the school after school-based assessment and intervention or if it includes pupils who have not yet been assessed by their teachers. In the latter case, one would expect several months to elapse before individual psychological assessment, while the school carries out its own assessment programme and develops and implements a learning plan.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that there would be a backlog of assessment work to be met when NEPS was established. However, good progress has been made. The NEPS east coast region conducted a survey of the psychological service in the region in April 2003, which indicated that the average elapsed time between referral and first interview was five weeks. This is a well-staffed region and may not be typical of the whole country. However, it perhaps indicates what may be expected when NEPS is up to full strength.</P>
    <P>All NEPS psychologists are required to include in their service or business plans a number of contingency days for urgent cases, for example, severe behavioural difficulties or severe disability or children who are the subject of legal proceedings. Such events are responded to in a matter of weeks if not days. Pupils that are perceived to have less serious problems may therefore have to wait longer for psychological assessment, but meanwhile they can receive help in school with advice from their psychologist.</P>
    <P>If NEPS psychologists are concerned about the length of waiting time in an individual case, they can bring this to their line manager, who may arrange for help from the rest of the local team. If there are similar problems in schools served by SCPA, they can bring this to the attention of the NEPS manager of SCPA.</P>

Under section 15 (2) (<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to <Col N="1244"/>send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected.</P>
    <P>In relation to the application of fair and objective entrance criteria for entry to second level schools, my Department has agreed with the three post-primary managerial associations that the selection of pupils for enrolment in second level schools should not be based on academic ability.

On that basis, emphasis should be placed by post-primary schools on catering, in the first instance, for children from their own communities and catchment areas.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority.

This includes provision in the following areas: &euro;8 million for pre-school programmes such as the early start pilot project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage; &euro;73 million for disadvantaged programmes at primary level such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home school community liaison scheme, and the giving children an even break programme; &euro;35 million for post&ndash;primary level disadvantaged schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, and the home school community liaison scheme; &euro;30 million for programmes which operate at both primary and post primary levels, including the school completion programme which is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving; &euro;20 million for disadvantaged youth schemes; &euro;175 million for further education measures such as the back to education initiative, the youthreach programme, and the adult literacy programme; &euro;197 million for measures specifically designed to broaden access to third level education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This direct expenditure on educational disadvantage represents some 8.3% of total projected expenditure by my Department in 2004.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes and I will make an announcement in this regard once the review has been completed.</P>
    <P>Any application for special educational needs, SEN, supports received in my Department will be considered in the context of the criteria outlined in the relevant Department circulars and the <Col N="1246"/>existing level of special educational needs, SEN, resources already available in the school.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting children with special educational needs within the primary school system is reflected in the very significant growth in investment in special needs provision in recent years. This is illustrated by the following details.The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531 at present. The annual salary cost of these teachers is approximately &euro;54 million.</P>
    <P>The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,500 currently. The annual salary cost of these teachers is estimated at more than &euro;75 million.</P>
    <P>The number of special needs assistants within the primary system has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,319 full-time and a further 1,353 part-time posts. The salary cost of this service in 2003 was &euro;103.56 million and is estimated at &euro;120 million for 2004.</P>
    <P>The allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special educational needs has been increased from &euro;24.27 million in 2003 to &euro;31.7 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>Funding towards special equipment within the primary school system has increased from &euro;2.12 million in 2003 to &euro;3 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>The resources that have been and that continue to be allocated by my Department represent real and substantial improvements in special education services. They provide concrete evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build on the unprecedented development of special education services.</P>

	<P>Since publication of Judge Ryan&rsquo;s review of the work of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the commission has held meetings with all interested parties, including the Department of Education and Science and representative groups, to facilitate them in expressing their views on the content of the reports and to enable them to make suggestions on the future operation of the investigation committee of the commission.</P>
    <P>On 7 May 2004 the commission presented a position paper entitled &ldquo;Identifying Institutions and Persons under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000&rdquo; and a document entitled &ldquo;Background to Events Surrounding the Reconstitution of the Investigation Committee&rdquo;. These and other related documents are available from the commission&rsquo;s website at <Col N="1247"/><i>www.childabusecommission.ie.</i> The main question posed in the discussion paper is whether the investigation committee should name individual abusers.</P>
    <P>The commission announced that a formal hearing of the investigation committee is being scheduled for 24 May 2004 to receive submissions on the matter. Representative groups will also be given an opportunity to express their views and to discuss the matter subsequent to this hearing.</P>
    <P>Work on drafting of legislation amending the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 is at an advanced stage and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will incorporate legislative amendments suggested in Judge Ryan&rsquo;s report. In addition to this any further changes that may be deemed necessary arising from further recommendations that may be received from the commission, once it has concluded its consultation process around mid-June, will be considered.</P>
    <P>The commission has a wide remit in relation to the investigation of child abuse and its inquiries cover day schools as well reformatories and industrial schools. The closing date for receipt of complainant statements was July 2002.</P>
    <P>The confidential committee of the commission continues to work as normal and has completed hearings in 856 out of 1058 cases.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is desirable that parents and the public in general have information about schools that is meaningful, fair and fully rounded. At present this information can often be anecdotal and based on hearsay. More recently, we have seen the introduction of an unofficial form of league table based upon third level entry patterns.</P>
    <P>The issue here is not about crude league tables based upon raw examination results. My Department does not publish raw examination results at present nor has it any intention of publishing examination results in their raw form in the future.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say what we are against. We must also discuss and decide what we want. For my part I want a real debate about the issue. The question at the heart of this debate is whether we want to know if a school is effective. By effective I mean are students in the school achieving to their potential? For some students this will mean high academic achievement and for others it will mean simply completing school. Let us be clear: <Col N="1248"/>all students are equally important and the success of the less academically able child is of equal importance.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider if it is possible for us to have an information model which has regard to a school&rsquo;s contribution to the academic, pastoral and social needs of the student and also takes account of all school sponsored activities such as sport and drama.</P>
    <P>In other words, any information model that we might use to gauge the effectiveness and quality of schools must be sufficiently sophisticated to reflect the fact that achievement in school is influenced by factors as diverse as socio-economic background, gender and ethnicity. I accept that this is a complex matter, which requires clear and open debate.</P>
    <P>To inform the process of public debate I have asked the OECD directorate of education to provide me with comparative materials from other countries on this issue. This will provide examples of international practice in this area.</P>
    <P>As well as the comparative analysis, I envisage that appropriate consultations on this issue will take place at a later date.</P>

	<P>This year&rsquo;s school building programme is the largest in the history of the State. Included in the overall funding of &euro;388 million was an additional amount of &euro;30 million, details of which were announced earlier this year. A total of 32 schools &mdash; 17 primary and 15 post-primary &mdash; will benefit from this additional &euro;30 million investment. In fact, the total funding allocation in 2004 will enable more than 200 significant projects to be authorised to progress to tender and construction along with a significantly expanded small schools initiative, asbestos remediation programme and new summer works scheme. This brings to almost &euro;2 billion the amount that has been invested since 1998 in the school building programme at both primary and post-primary levels. This is a very significant amount of investment. This level of investment will need to be maintained if the goal of eliminating sub-standard accommodation is to be achieved.</P>

	<P>The working group on student councils, which is chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office and is representative of <Col N="1250"/>students and all the partners in education was set up to encourage the establishment of effective and democratic student councils in all post-primary schools in the country. This is in accordance with the Education Act 1998, which encourages the establishment of student councils in all post-primary schools and with goal 1 of the national children&rsquo;s strategy which is to give children and young people a voice in matters that affect their lives.</P>
    <P>Under section 27 of the Education Act 1998, students in a post-primary school may establish a student council, the role of which is to promote the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. This development originated in my Department&rsquo;s recognition that students have a voice and a contribution to make to their school and these councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community.</P>
    <P>In 2002 my Department issued comprehensive guidelines on student councils to all second level schools. The guidelines, entitled &ldquo;Student Councils: A Voice for Students&rdquo; provide practical guidance to school management, teachers and students on the establishment and operation of student councils.</P>
    <P>In a recent survey, conducted by my Department, it emerged that student councils have been established in 558 of the 743 post-primary schools surveyed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 109 together.</P>
    <P>The early start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. The aims of Early Start are to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in early start is to establish groups of 15 pupils in existing primary schools in disadvantaged areas, with each class being run by a primary school teacher and a qualified child care worker. While the early start curriculum emphasises the development of cognitive and language skills, due regard is also had to personal and social development. The early start service has not been expanded since 1995.</P>
    <P>In regard to future development of early childhood education provision for disadvantaged children, my Department, as part of a detailed review of educational disadvantage programmes, is currently exploring how such provision should best be delivered in the future. I am particularly concerned to ensure that any future actions by my Department in this area are based on a collaborative approach with other Departments involved in the overall early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector. Meeting the overall objective of providing the best possible service to the communities and children involved requires that any educational provision by my Department <Col N="1252"/>takes account of child care measures under the remit of other Departments.</P>
    <P>The future development of the early start pre-school project is being considered as part of this process and I will make an announcement in this regard as soon as the detailed review of all initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage has been completed.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Authority has published a consultation document as part of a review of the recurrent funding model currently in operation in the universities. According to the Higher Education Authority, the aim is to put a revised funding model in place which will enable increasingly autonomous and market driven institutions to respond to public interest agendas, at national, international and regional levels, while also taking a greater responsibility for their own financial sustainability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative of the Higher Education Authority in conducting this review. The Deputy will be aware that I have invited the OECD to conduct an extensive review of higher education in Ireland in order to map a future strategy for the sector. This is set against a background of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objective to place its higher education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and level of participation and by the priority to create a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure in Ireland. The OECD review will evaluate how well the Irish higher education sector is meeting these strategic objectives and will offer recommendations for future progress by reference to comparative performance in other OECD countries.</P>
    <P>The role of Exchequer funding in rewarding and incentivising progress on broad policy objectives and in encouraging innovation at institutional level is clearly an important element of this. The responses to the HEA consultation document will make an important contribution to dialogue on the next steps forward in this regard.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackling absenteeism and early school leaving is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003-2005 and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage: literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling absenteeism and early school leaving comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as preventative interventions. The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, my Department is <Col N="1254"/>working with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element, such as the school completion programme, the home school community liaison scheme, and the visiting teachers for Travellers service, are exploited to the full.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a number of disadvantaged programmes, which provide additional supports for children in primary and post-primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The school completion programme is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling early school leaving. There are currently 82 projects involving 404 schools &mdash; 295 primary and 109 post-primary &mdash; participating in the school completion programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to curriculum reform, my Department&rsquo;s strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme, vocational preparation and training and the leaving certificate applied.</P>
    <P>A detailed review of all educational disadvantage initiatives is nearing completion and this will impact on existing schemes. I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.</P>

	<P>There are no specific plans of the nature referred to by the Deputy under active consideration at present. The proposal referred to has been recently introduced as a suggestion into the wider public debate on the future of higher education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have invited the OECD to conduct an extensive review of higher education in Ireland in order to map a future strategy for the sector. This is set against a background of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objective of placing its higher education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and level of participation and by the priority to create <Col N="1255"/>a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure in Ireland. The OECD review will evaluate how well the Irish higher education sector is meeting these strategic objectives and will offer recommendations for future progress by reference to comparative performance in other OECD countries. The OECD review team brings an unprecedented wealth and spread of expertise to the task. It has  undertaken extensive consultation with all key stakeholders in the sector during a visit to Ireland in February and is currently engaged in the complex process of formulating its report. Potential approaches to the future resourcing of the third level sector in Ireland are being considered as part of the review.</P>
    <P>A wide range of suggestions and proposals have been put to the OECD team, both through the many formal submissions received and in the extensive discussions that it has undertaken. All of these are under consideration as part of its deliberations and should be considered openly in the context of the broad nature of the exercise being undertaken. I do not propose to pre-empt the outcome of the review at this time.</P>
    <P>In common with all those in society with an interest in the development of our higher education system, I await the outcome of the review with interest and look forward to future dialogue on the next steps.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The remarks to which the Deputy refers were aimed at encouraging debate on the very important issues associated with high points pressure for second level students and the implications of this for the educational experience of students at senior cycle level.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the report of the commission on the points system of 1999 was that the points system should be retained on the basis that it is well established, is broadly fair and transparent and is generally accepted by the public at large. However, the report also found that a number of damaging effects were attributed to the points system. The report pointed to a negative impact on students&rsquo; personal development; the fact that students&rsquo; subject choices were being unduly influenced by the aim of maximising the level of points for entry to third level education; a narrowing of the curriculum arising from the tendency to teach to the examination rather than to the aims of the curriculum; and an undue focus on the attainment of examination results. The report noted that the courses for which the greatest competition occurs and in which the cut-off points are consistently high are the health care courses.</P>
    <P><?oasys _cl10.5-?>As the Deputy will be aware, last August, the HEA published a report, &ldquo;Study into Alternate Methods of Entry into Health Sciences Professional Courses at Third Level&rdquo;. The report <Col N="1257"/>was commissioned by the HEA at my request on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government and proposes the removal of health science professional courses from the points system. The report recommends that entry to a range of health sciences programmes should be on a post-graduate basis. It finds that removing entry selection to these high points programmes from the CAO points system would have hugely positive benefits for individual students in terms of reduced pressure and enhanced educational experience at senior cycle in second level. The implementation issues associated with this recommendation for medical education are currently being considered by a working group on undergraduate medical education.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, I have invited the OECD to conduct an extensive review of higher education in Ireland in order to map a future strategy for the sector. This is set against a background of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objective of placing its higher education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and level of participation and by the priority to create a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition, through its ongoing work, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is pursuing quality and ongoing improvement of the educational experiences of children and young people. Its consultative work in reviewing second level senior cycle education is aimed at supporting this objective.</P>
    <P>I welcome all contributions to the important debate on how we can ensure that our senior cycle education system best serves the educational interests of our young people, while facilitating progression in maximum numbers and on an equitable and transparent basis to higher education.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy. The thrust of the recommendations in the report are generally in line with measures already being promoted in Ireland in the area of noise in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation and deals with the matter of exposure of persons at work to noise.</P>
    <P>The relevant legislation is the European Community (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations 1990, which apply to the protection of workers in all workplaces, including places of entertainment. These regulations are intended to reduce hearing damage caused by loud noise. An employer must assess the noise exposure level and if it is above 85 decibels, 85-dB(A) preventive action must be taken. Noise exposure must be kept to the lowest level practicable by, for instance, quieting the source of noise or reducing the amount of time people spend in a noisy area. All workers who are exposed to a daily exposure level of 85dB(A) or more are entitled to have a hearing test at the employer&rsquo;s expense.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, where exposure is likely to exceed 85dB(A), the employer&rsquo;s obligations include: measuring the noise levels and reducing them as far as reasonably practicable; informing workers of the measurements taken of the noise levels; providing information and training to employees on the risk of noise exposure; and providing hearing protection such as ear muffs or plugs.</P>
    <P>The regulations will be updated and replaced by new provisions to give effect to Directive <Col N="1259"/>2003/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents, namely noise, which is due to be transposed into national law by the member states by February 2006. In the meantime, the Health and Safety Authority has produced a &ldquo;Guide to Exposure to Noise in the Entertainment Industry&rdquo; which covers a range of issues in the sector, including assessing exposure to noise, reducing exposure to noise, steps to be taken if exposure occurs over 85dB(A), steps to be taken if exposure occurs over 90dB(A), and hearing tests.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 125 and 127 together.</P>
    <P>I understand that world steel prices have risen substantially, due primarily to economic growth in producer countries such as China, where increased home market demand has led to a reduction in the volumes available for export. At <Col N="1260"/>European level, trade related issues in relation to steel and coke fall within the ambit of the common commercial policy. The European Commission, with advice from the EU member states including the Irish Presidency in the Art.133 committee, represent EU interests and engage with third countries and international organisations, such as WTO, to resolve disputes. Such engagement is ongoing currently in relation to trade in steel and coke.</P>
    <P>With regard to the impact on competitiveness and the Irish economy, it is not apparent that developments in relation to steel pricing have given rise to movement in tender prices or have specifically impacted on the cost of apartments or manufacturing projects. Hyper-inflation in market prices of construction materials will be considered in the context of the development of Government policy on fixed price contracts. Suppliers of steel products are subject to the same business and consumer regulations as every other supplier of goods and services in Ireland, including competition law.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions) Regulations 2000 implemented Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. The purpose of the directive was to confirm, clarify and consolidate existing patent law with regard to biotechnological inventions throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>The directive does not allow unlimited patentability of subject matter. As in the case of inventions in other areas of technology, biotechnological inventions are patentable only if they are new and susceptible of industrial application, and involve an inventive step. Also, patents will not be granted in respect of biotechnological inventions, the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality.</P>
    <P>The following are not patentable under the directive: plant and animal varieties, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals; the human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene; processes for cloning human beings; <Col N="1262"/>processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; and processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals or animals resulting from such processes which are likely to cause them suffering without substantial medical benefit to man or animal.</P>

	<P>Insurance can be bought from an insurance company in another European economic area, EEA, country if the company&rsquo;s name is on the list of authorised insurance companies. Any insurer authorised to write business in the EEA may provide insurance into any other member state, including Ireland, on a freedom to provide services basis. However, the authorising member state must notify the host member state &mdash; in this case Ireland &mdash; of the company&rsquo;s intention to write business in its territory and certify the solvency of the company.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies from countries outside of the EEA are also permitted to write business into Ireland on a freedom to provide services basis, but only for certain classes of business referred to collectively as marine, aviation and transit, MAT, business. As for EEA countries, a notification from the insurance supervisory authority of the authorising country, attesting that the company is authorised to write business in the relevant classes together with a solvency certificate must be submitted to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, before the company can be authorised to write business in Ireland and be placed on the list of authorised insurance companies.</P>
    <P>An insurance company established in another EEA member state can apply to establish a branch in Ireland through its home state supervisory authority, which, when satisfied, forward a file to IFSRA, which has two months to notify the home state supervisor of the conditions under which, in the interest of the general good, the insurance business may be carried out in Ireland.</P><?oasys _cl11.2-?>
    <P>Since 1 May 2003 IFSRA has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of insurance <Col N="1263"/>undertakings, and any further information required in relation to this matter can be obtained from IFSRA.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 129 and 130 together.</P>
    <P>In June 1996, my Department approved grant assistance of 104,000 ECUs or about £83,000 under the EU-funded small business operational programme for a project proposed by the organisation concerned. In accordance with the normal procedures for the relevant measure, an initial grant of 50% of the total approved was made at that time, while a further grant of 30% was issued in September 1997 following the submission of a progress report on the project by <Col N="1264"/>the organisation. The only modification to the terms for the project made by my Department in 1997 related to the timing of certain reporting requirements and I do not consider that this did, or could have had, any bearing on the subsequent allegation of fraud that was made by the organisation.</P>
    <P>On 29 January 1999, the organisation wrote to the Department advising it that it appeared to the organisation that it had received an overpayment from the Department in respect of expenses amounting to £16,500 on foot of which a grant had been paid at the rate of 75%. At a meeting with the Department on 5 March 1999, to discuss this matter, the Department was advised by the organisation that it had decided to alert the Garda fraud squad to suspected irregularities in relation to the claims submitted to the Department for funding for the project arising from the organisation&rsquo;s concerns about invoices in the amount of £16,500 received from a supplier of services to the organisation. The Department was advised that the organisation&rsquo;s auditors had also been informed about the matter and that the Department would be kept informed about developments. At that stage, the Department suspended any further payments in respect of this project pending the conclusion of the investigations into the matter. The Department subsequently co-operated fully with the fraud squad.</P>
    <P>On 23 June 2000, the organisation wrote to the Department and confirmed that an extensive investigation by its auditors had found no evidence of fraud and that, following a fraud squad investigation, a file had been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who had decided that there were no grounds for action. The organisation indicated that it had accepted the results of these investigations and, accordingly, the invoices, which had been the subject of the investigations, were paid by the organisation on 23 June 2000.</P>
    <P>In my earlier reply to the Deputy on 6 April, I have already indicated that my Department was not a party to the allegations made and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the basis on which the organisation made the allegations. However, the Department has confirmed to the person concerned both in correspondence and in the course of several meetings that the Department does not have any issue or concern to pursue with him. Furthermore, all relevant documents relating to the issues have been released to this person. It is a matter for the individual concerned to decide how such documentation might be of use to him in relation to his dealings with any third parties.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the House when replying to Question No. 183 on 3 March and Question No. 90 on 11 March 2004, where a member of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, is killed in the course of duty or dies from a wound received in the course of duty, whether on duty at home or overseas, enhanced spouse&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s allowances are payable under the Army Pensions Acts. In addition, the standard death gratuity under the Defence Forces pensions schemes and any widow(er)&rsquo;s entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts are payable.</P>
    <P>As I also indicated, additional lump sum death benefits would be payable under my Department&rsquo;s special extra-statutory compensation scheme where a member of the PDF was killed in the course of duty while serving overseas with an international United Nations force. The question of extending this scheme to personnel serving with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and other such overseas missions is now being considered by my Department under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the PDF. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment further in the matter at this stage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
    <P>It is the policy to allow military sports facilities to be used by local community-based groups and clubs subject to prior requirements of the Defence Forces. Such facilities, which are located throughout the country, are extensively used by such groups. With regard to the Curragh swimming pool, which is the only such facility located in a military complex, the position, at present, is that schools based in the local area are being allowed to use the facility. It is intended to further expand the use of this resource as soon as possible and arrangements will then be made to permit local swimming clubs to use the pool.</P>

	<P>The refurbishment of accommodation facilities is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s building plans, as part of an ongoing investment programme within the Defence Forces. Accommodation for Defence Forces personnel in Cathal Brugha Barracks has been substantially upgraded in recent years. This included the refurbishment of billet blocks at a cost of &euro;2 million, completed in September 2003 and refurbishment of officer accommodation in 2001 at a cost of almost &euro;1 million.</P>
    <P>The building programme for this year includes a project estimated to cost &euro;750,000 to upgrade two building blocks to provide transit accommodation and locker facilities for other ranks personnel. This year&rsquo;s programme proposes to refurbish existing buildings as a new battalion headquarters, which will enable the existing larger headquarters to be vacated and used for accommodation purposes. It is anticipated that the latter project, which will provide modern living in accommodation, will be included in the 2005 capital works programme at an estimated cost of &euro;2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Routine maintenance will continue to be carried out within the barracks. I am fully committed to the ongoing development of accommodation facilities throughout the Defence Forces, and improvements will continue to be carried out in the light of competing demands and availability of financial resources.</P>

	<P>The property in question was offered for sale to the occupants in 1999 for a sum of &euro;31,743.45 &mdash; £25,000 &mdash; but they did not proceed with the sale. It would appear that some of the occupants, adult children may remain in residence in the quarters and, in that regard, the Department would be prepared to allow the house to be purchased in the joint names of the parents and of the children. This course of action, which assists purchasers in obtaining a mortgage, has been availed of in respect of a number of the sales at Orchard Park.</P>

The 80% advance instalment amounting to &euro;1793.20 issued on 16 October 2002 while a balancing payment for &euro;52.01 issued on 30 April 2003. The total suckler cow premium due on ten animals is &euro;2241.50 but in the case of the person named a penalty of 17.68% has been applied to payment. This penalty was applied in accordance with paragraph 43 of the terms and conditions of the scheme as a result of 11 animals found at inspection on 13 December 2002 that were not compliant with identification and <Col N="1268"/>registration requirements. These 11 animals did not include any of those listed in the question.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for first age special beef premium in respect of 42 animals including the eight animals listed in the question. Payment for the 42 animals has issued in full subject to application of the appropriate penalty for non-compliance with the identification and registration requirements as outlined above. No application was received for second age premium in respect of the eight animals in question.</P>

The application has been processed for payment and his 80% advance instalment amounting to &euro;4704.47 issued on 29 October 2003. This payment was in respect of 26.5 animals, being the number of quota rights on record for the applicant. As the closing date for the scheme was 27 June 2003, payment was also subject to a 1% late application penalty applied in accordance with paragraph 29 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. Processing in respect of the 20% balancing instalment is complete and payment will issue as soon as a query arising under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme is resolved.</P>
    <P>Under the slaughter premium scheme 54 animals were slaughtered under the herd number of the person named. The 80% advance payment issued in respect of 53 animals on 21 October 2003. The person named was contacted regarding the movement of one animal which had been incorrectly notified to the CMMS database. Balancing payments cannot issue until the query on this animal has been resolved.</P>
    <P>The person named submitted one application under the 2003 special beef-bull premium scheme on 21 August 2003 in respect of three animals. The 80% advance payment in respect of two animals issued on 2 December 2003. One of the animals included on this application was not seven months old and therefore too young to be considered for payment under the special beef premium scheme.

One of the animals included on the application of 22 December 2003 was notified to the CMMS database incorrectly. This query has now been resolved and balancing payments on all 2003 special beef premium applications will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>During 2003 four animals eligible for the slaughter premium scheme were slaughtered under the herd number of the person named. The 80% advance in respect of these four animals issued on 21 October 2003 and 12 March 2004. The balancing payments will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for premium on 15 animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. The application has been processed for payment and his 80% advance instalment amounting to &euro;2689.80 was paid on 17 October 2003. The 20% balancing payment will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>The person named applied to participate in the 2003 extensification premium. Payment of this premium is scheduled to commence next month but it is too early to confirm if he will qualify for payment. The person named was due &euro;1,338.65 under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme of which &euro;911.41 was paid to him on 22 September 2003 with the balance of &euro;427.24 offset against arrears of land purchase annuities.</P>

	<P>There appears to be confusion between two parcels of land allotted by the former Land Commission to the person named. He received one plot from the former Land Commission in exchange for land surrendered by him and this plot has been vested in the person named and all relevant documentation leading to registration has been lodged in the Land Registry under Schedule No. 92813.</P>
    <P>The second plot was sold to him by the former Land Commission in 1986 by means of a standard purchase agreement subject to a land purchase annuity of £390 per annum. The two annual payments under the annuity have not been paid at any time by the person named since 1986 and the arrears at present amount to &euro;3,733.70. As a result the plot has not been vested in the person named or title documents registered in the Land Registry. I propose to introduce a new land purchase annuity buy out scheme in upcoming legislation. However, to avail of this proposed scheme all arrears of the annuity must be paid up to date.</P>

    <P>Under Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to using the flexibility in the nitrates directive to seek European Commission approval for organic nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg per hectare<i> per annum</i> to be allowable in appropriate <Col N="1273"/>circumstances.

The issue has also been discussed at meetings, including a meeting earlier this week, between officials of both Departments and the farming pillar under Sustaining Progress, at which the IFA was represented.</P>
    <P>The terms of the action programme need to be finalised at an early date given that EU co-funding of schemes such as the REP scheme, disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance, early retirement and forestry is conditional on satisfactory implementation of the nitrates directive. Compliance with the directive has also been specified as one of the conditions for farmers&rsquo; participation in the single payment scheme following the decoupling of farm supports from production. Furthermore, following a judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, it is open to the court, on the application of the European Commission, to impose substantial fines against Ireland if early action is not taken to give full effect to the directive.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland is legally obliged to put into effect an action programme for the further implementation of the nitrates directive. The European Court of Justice, in its judgment on 11 March 2004, held that Ireland had not fulfilled its obligations under the nitrates directive by reason of its failure to establish and implement an action programme in accordance with article 5 of the directive. It is open to the court, on the application of the European <Col N="1274"/>Commission, to impose substantial fines against Ireland if early action is not taken to give full effect to the directive.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the terms of the action programme need to be finalised at an early date given that EU co-funding of schemes such as the REP scheme, disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance, early retirement and forestry is conditional on satisfactory implementation of the nitrates directive. Compliance with the directive has also been specified as one of the conditions for farmers&rsquo; participation in the single payment scheme following the decoupling of farm supports from production.</P>
    <P>A draft action programme prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, was presented in December last to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. Written submissions on the draft action programme have been received from some 70 stakeholders, including all the main farming bodies, and a revised draft is being prepared by officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government together with officials from my own Department.</P>
    <P>Under Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to using the flexibility in the nitrates directive to seek European Commission approval for organic nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg per hectare <i>per annum</i> to be allowable in appropriate circumstances. It was also agreed in Sustaining Progress that the Government would engage with the main farming organizations and other interests on the development of the action programme for implementation of the nitrates directive. The consultations initiated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in December last are part of that process. The issue has also been discussed at meetings, including a meeting earlier this week, between officials of both Departments and the farming pillar under Sustaining Progress, at which the IFA was represented.</P>
    <P>Once the draft action programme is finalised and submitted to the Commission, Ireland will also submit a derogation proposal designed to take account of the unique characteristics of Irish agriculture. A number of significant steps have been taken to address the costs at farm level of the implementation of the draft action programme. The Government, in Sustaining Progress, stated: &ldquo;recognising the importance of the nitrates directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources&rdquo;. These initiatives included a review of the REP scheme with higher payment rates and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme including, in particular, increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings.</P><Col N="1275"/>
    <P>The improvements in the farm waste management schemes and the dairy hygiene schemes are already in place and changes to the REP scheme, delivering an average increase of 28% in payments to farmers, are expected to be approved shortly by the European Commission with retroactive effect.</P>
    <P>The scheme of capital allowances for expenditure on farm pollution control has been extended to the end of 2006. A committee is currently examining issues associated with the possible introduction of low cost wintering facilities such as earthen bank tanks for the storage of livestock manures.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that section 8(1) of the VAT Act 1972, as amended, provides that traders who supply taxable goods or services within the State in the course or furtherance of business are obliged to register and account for Irish VAT, subject to the appropriate turnover thresholds. Foreign firms, not established in Ireland, which are involved in supplying goods or services here are generally obliged to register, charge and account for Irish VAT regardless of turnover.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, and where the Irish customer is registered for VAT, the foreign trader may not be required to register for VAT, and the Irish customer will account for the VAT on the transaction. In any event VAT must be accounted for on all taxable transactions in the State carried out by foreign traders. An information leaflet, VAT information leaflet No. 1/99, on the subject of the VAT treatment of foreign firms doing business in Ireland is <Col N="1277"/>available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The standard procedure in the type of case referred to by the Deputy is for any application for waiver of the State&rsquo;s interest to be investigated by the Chief State Solicitor and for advice to be given to the Minister for Finance by the Attorney General, whereupon the Minister then makes a decision whether or not to grant the waiver sought.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is important in these cases that every step is taken to ascertain whether or not next of kin may exist who may have a legal entitlement to the estate. In this case, I understand that an application for waiver is currently being examined by the Office of the Attorney General and that a recommendation is likely to be made shortly. I can assure the Deputy that any advice which is received from the Attorney General in this matter will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I have made it clear on many occasions that the decentralisation programme will operate on a voluntary basis. While decentralisation will inevitably change certain aspects of the way in which the public service operates, there will, broadly speaking, continue to be the same promotion opportunities across the service.</P>
    <P>The decentralised nature of the service will mean that public servants will, in future, have to consider their career prospects in the light of opportunities that arise both in Dublin and outside Dublin. The issue of regional promotion structures is one which, I would expect, will arise in discussions with the public service unions. I am confident that arrangements will be put in place to ensure that sufficient staff are available to carry out the work of the Department and agencies involved in the decentralisation programme.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has publicly and strongly condemned the mistreatment and abuse of prisoners in Iraq by US and UK forces. We made our concerns known directly to the US and UK authorities when the allegations first came to light. Yesterday, the EU Council of Ministers, acting on the initiative of the Irish Presidency, adopted the following conclusions. The Council expressed its abhorrence at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraqi prisons. The Council condemned any instances of abuse and degradation of prisoners in Iraq, which are contrary to international law, including the Geneva Conventions. The Council welcomed the commitment by the relevant governments to bring to justice any individuals responsible for such acts involving the abuse of Iraqi detainees, and their commitment to rectify any failure to adhere to international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>I have been active in ensuring that similar statements were included in the Presidency conclusions issued after last week&rsquo;s EuroMed ministerial meeting in Dublin and in the joint communiqu&eacute; adopted at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting between the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council.</P>
    <P>The issue of the abuse of prisoners by US personnel was raised at last Friday&rsquo;s meeting between G8 foreign ministers and President Bush and at the subsequent ministerial meeting, both of which I attended. Both President Bush and Secretary of State Powell condemned the mistreatment of prisoners in the strongest possible terms and expressed the Administration&rsquo;s determination that those responsible should be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Jack Straw, briefed the EU External Relations Council yesterday on his government&rsquo;s investigation into allegations of prisoner abuse. He made clear that such abuse would not be tolerated, that all allegations were being thoroughly investigated and that anybody found to be responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners would be brought to justice. He confirmed that recent photographs <Col N="1280"/>published by the <i>Daily Mirror </i>showing abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British troops were forgeries.</P>
    <P>I believe that the recent evidence of prisoner abuse in Iraq has reminded the entire international community of the need to respect and maintain international law in respect of the treatment of prisoners. The Government will continue to work to reinforce this point and thereby ensure that something positive may yet come from this appalling episode.</P>

	<P>The Embassy of Ireland, London, met the British authorities at official level on 20 November 2003 and again on 10 May 2004 to discuss the introduction of national identity cards in the UK.</P>
    <P>I understand that assurances have been provided by the British Government that the principles of freedom of movement throughout the common travel area covering the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Ireland and the UK will not be compromised by this scheme. Furthermore, assurances were given that Irish nationals living in the United Kingdom will be treated in exactly the same way as British nationals as far as this proposed scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>With respect to the way in which persons in Northern Ireland will be regarded in respect of their nationality on the card, the embassy in London has raised this crucial issue with the Home Office, and brought the relevant passages of the Good Friday Agreement to the attention of the British officials. Consultations are ongoing and no decision has been made with regard to this aspect of the proposal. The Irish Government will continue to monitor developments and consult with the British authorities to ensure that the concerns of Irish citizens are fully taken into account.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Government&rsquo;s position on the US embargo has been made very clear over the years by our consistent vote against it, together with our EU partners, in the UN General Assembly, most recently on 4 November 2003. In bilateral contacts with the US administration, we have never left them in any doubt regarding our strong opposition to the embargo. It is our belief that the effect of the embargo is to work contrary to stated EU and US aspirations for a democratic and prosperous Cuba. We welcomed the partial easing of the embargo in the year 2000, whereby the ban on the sale of food and medicines was lifted, and since then we have continued to urge that the embargo be removed completely.</P>
    <P>A Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba was established by President Bush on 10 October 2003. Its mandate was to identify &ldquo;additional measures by which the US could help the Cuban people bring about an expeditious end of the Castro dictatorship&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;US Government programmes that could assist the Cuban people during a transition&rdquo;. The Commission, chaired by Secretary of State Powell, reported to President Bush on 6 May 2004. Upon publication of the report, President Bush directed that certain immediate actions should be taken, including a decision to limit recipients of remittances and gift parcels; to limit family visits to Cuba; to reduce the authorised daily expenditure during a trip to Cuba; and to step up law enforcement measures against those carrying funds to Cuba in contravention of US policy.</P>
    <P>President Bush also directed that up to US$59 million should be committed over the next two years to implementing other commission recommendations, including democracy-building activities and support for family members of the political opposition, as well as support for young people, women and Afro-Cubans and public diplomacy efforts. The concern of the Cuban authorities at the new US measures has been conveyed to the Government by the Cuban charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires in Dublin.</P>
    <P>While the new US measures are essentially a bilateral matter between the US and Cuba, the US authorities are in no doubt as to the Irish and EU view as to how best to promote a democratic transition in Cuba. The aim of the EU common position remains to &ldquo;encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people&rdquo;. We believe that the way to achieve this is by engagement rather than by isolation.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it must be realistically acknowledged that the Cuban authorities do not <Col N="1282"/>always seem to wish to respond positively to our constructive approach. Events in recent weeks in Cuba represent a further serious setback for the cause of human rights, as manifested in particular by the trial and sentencing of 13 dissidents for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of speech, opinion, assembly and association. This follows the harshly repressive measures taken in March and April last year, which resulted in lengthy prison sentences for 75 dissidents, as well as the summary trial and rapid execution of three ferry-boat hijackers in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these disappointing setbacks, Ireland and our EU partners will continue to persevere with our policy of constructive engagement with Cuba with a view ultimately to seeing the aims of the common position achieved, namely, the initiation of a transition to a system of pluralist democracy embracing human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided in 2002, on foot of a recommendation contained in the report of the Ireland Aid Review Committee, to integrate the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, into the Department of Foreign Affairs. This decision has been implemented and the functions and responsibilities of the former APSO are now being carried out by Development Co-operation Ireland. These include the facilitation of voluntary service as part of an overall poverty reduction strategy in our development co-operation programme; support for the activities of NGOs and missionary groups, which includes volunteer sending and placement of expatriate personnel overseas; and the safeguarding of the interests of development workers and volunteers in development.</P>
    <P>I launched the volunteer 21 initiative, a reference to volunteering in development in the 21st century, in December 2003 to provide support for voluntary activity by Irish people in developing countries. On 21 April, I hosted a <Col N="1283"/>multi-stakeholder conference to take forward the consultation process on these issues. Practical and financial support for volunteers in developing countries is being provided by a volunteer 21 unit, comprising staff of the former APSO, within Development Co-operation Ireland.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the initiative which I launched last December, there were contacts at official level with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Officials from that Department also took part in the conference on 21 April. The question of whether a single agency is required to promote voluntary activity at home and abroad is a matter on which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will no doubt have views. I am confident, however, that the arrangements which I have put in place, and which take forward the excellent work done by APSO, will ensure that the specialist support needed by Irish voluntary workers in the development field abroad will be delivered efficiently.</P>

    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications in that batch has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service.

    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation.

    <P>This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs. It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P><Col N="1285"/>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children&rsquo;s homes and special schools, in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.</P>
    <P>My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory or inspection function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was limited due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time consuming and is continuing.</P><Col N="1288"/>
    <P>I can confirm for the Deputy that the hospital named in the question is one into which inquiries are being made as to its eligibility for inclusion. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</P>

The children in question reside 0.3 miles and 0.7 miles from the route of the service to Urlingford national school. As this service is within guidelines, an extension or re-routing of service is not warranted.</P>

    <P>As I announced when publishing the programme, a key strategy for school building projects will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 <Col N="1291"/>onwards. This strategy will provide better clarity for schools in terms of when they can expect their projects to proceed.</P>
    <P>As the first step in the review process, my Department carried out consultations with the education partners in relation to the prioritisation criteria used for large-scale building projects. The purpose of these consultations was to ensure that the criteria has optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post primary sectors.

    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs. It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils, and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER for pupils in the school referred to by the Deputy. The position is that SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including ones for the school in question are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils, and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at <Col N="1296"/>present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended also that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>

	<P>There are nine primary schools in Lucan and they will offer a total of 662 junior infant places this year. This figure represents an increase of 56 places on September 2003. My Department has not been made aware of any child being unable to access a place in Lucan in 2003.</P>
    <P>Swift and decisive actions have been taken to address the demands that have emerged from the rapid development of Lucan over recent years. Within the last five years a total sum of &euro;19 million has been invested in providing and upgrading educational provision in Lucan, &euro;12 million at primary level and &euro;7 million at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>This expansion is set to continue with three new schools due to commence construction this year. Specifically at primary level, building projects have recently been completed at Scoil &Aacute;ine junior school, St. Thomas&rsquo;s senior school and an entire new school has been provided for Lucan Educate Together national school in September 2003. A new 16 classroom school for Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school is one of over 200 large scale school building projects that has been fast-tracked to go to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme. Archbishop Ryan national school will re-organise this year to form a senior school and a junior school. The junior school will offer an additional two junior infant classes in September 2004. A permanent building project to facilitate the reorganisation of Archbishop Ryan national school is scheduled to proceed to construction later this year. In the interim, my Department has arranged for the provision of temporary accommodation while the new building is under construction. My Department has been dealing in a comprehensive way with the needs of this developing area and will continue to do so.</P>

The batch of approximately 5,000 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 is being considered at present. Priority was given to almost 1,000 cases involving children starting school last September and all those cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P><Col N="1302"/>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications in that batch has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. Those applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of such provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs, and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils, and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have previously stated, in establishing the National Council for Special Education I did not set out to create a council that was representative of any particular sectoral interests. This was because if it is to cater for all children having special education needs resulting from a disability, it is important that the council should function in a cohesive, non-representative way. The 13 members of the council that I have appointed have a wide range of relevant knowledge, experience and expertise.</P>
    <P>I established the council in December 2003 by order, the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003 under section 54 of the Education Act 1998. The 13 members of the first council have been appointed for a term of three years. In accordance with the terms of the order, two appointments to membership of the council were made from among the nominees of the NDA. Four appointments to membership of the council were made from among the nominees of organisations representing national associations of parents, recognised trade unions-staff associations representing teachers and school principals and recognised school management associations. All of the members of the council have a special interest in or knowledge relating to the education of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 is on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at present. The Bill includes provision for a national council for special education, so the existing council will be superseded by a council appointed under the terms of the Bill as enacted, when the Bill is enacted. As the Bill stands at present the consultation-nomination-appointment process is broadly similar to that contained in the order.</P>
    <P>In all of these circumstances I do not propose to meet with NAMHI or with any other representative organisation on the specific issue of representation for them on the National Council for Special Education.</P>

	<P>Officials of my Department&rsquo;s planning section meet on a regular basis with the planning department of South Dublin County Council with a view to identifying the need for additional educational provision and reserving sites for schools, where required. Arising from this process, a site for primary school purposes has been reserved in the Ballycullen area. A decision on the provision of a new school in Ballycullen will involve further consultations with the local authority regarding the rate and likely timescale of housing developments in the area, together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools in the area to meet the anticipated demand.</P>
    <P>A large-scale building project for Ballycragh national school is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> This project is at early stages of architectural planning.

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 312 pupils on 30 September 2002. Based on the enrolment on 30 September 2003 of 313 pupils, the mainstream staffing for the school year 2004-05 will remain at principal and 11 mainstream class teachers. The enrolment of 313 pupils is significantly less than the required minimum figure required for the appointment of a twelfth mainstream class teacher. It is open to the board of management of a primary school to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application date for appeal were issued recently to all primary schools.</P>

	<P>The position is that priority was given to cases involving applications relating to children starting school last September and all those cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>Other than junior infants, my Department received in the region of 305 applications for special education resources for pupils since 15 February 2003 in County Wexford. A batch of approximately 145 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 is being considered at present. The name of each school waiting on same is not readily available.</P>
    <P>The 145 applications in the 15 February to the 31 August period have been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. Those applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of such provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: (a) making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational <Col N="1314"/>needs; and (b) making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>
    <P>The school planning section of my Department has considered all applications for temporary accommodation. In the context of the available funding and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. The list of successful applicants is included in section 10 of the 2004 school building programme and it can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i></P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The school in Uccle, Brussels, is one of 12 European schools established by intergovernmental agreement to provide an education at first and second levels for the children of parents working in the European Commission or other European institutions. Ireland is a party to the convention governing the schools and, as such, has one representative on the board of governors of the schools, along with all the other parties, including 15 member states of the EU, the European Patent Office and the Commission, 17 in all; the ten new EU member states are expected to adhere to the convention shortly. All decisions relating to the running of the schools have to be sanctioned by the board.</P>
    <P>Each school provides education in a full range of subjects for pupils from kindergarten to the end of secondary school. Pupils are organised in different language sections and subjects such as maths and science are taught in a range of European languages. The schools also provide mother tongue teaching in all the languages of EU pupils in the schools.</P>
    <P>The schools are preparing to admit the children of parents from the ten accession states and, in addition to providing an extended range of language sections, mother tongue teaching will also have to be provided in the languages of the accession countries.</P>
    <P>As part of its obligations under the convention and in common with the other member states of the EU, my Department seconds a number of Irish teachers to work in the schools. The European Commission, as the employer of the parents of the pupils, provides direct financing for each school to cover the other costs of the schools, as the education of such children is free.</P>
    <P>The school in Uccle has currently 2,334 pupils, of whom 92 are the children of parents of Irish nationality working for the Commission or its institutions. From 2004-05 it will offer education in the core subjects throughout primary and secondary in the following language sections: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish <Col N="1316"/>and Hungarian. It will offer mother tongue teaching in those languages as well as Irish, Slovenian and Maltese and possibly Czech and Slovak. In addition, it offers religious instruction in all the principal faiths of its pupils.</P>
    <P>On the funding of the school at Uccle, the budget for 2004 is &euro;26,021,831; the Commission contribution is &euro;18,123,334; the Irish contribution by way of seconded teachers, two at primary and eight at second level, is &euro;358,673, not &euro;8 million as mentioned by the Deputy. Given both the size of the school and the extraordinary complexity of the task facing it in providing for such a variety of languages and cultures and also given its location in Brussels, it is not appropriate to compare the annual costs of the school with those of schools in this country.</P>

    <P>The school currently has the services of a shared learning support teacher. In addition, 10.5 part-time resource teaching hours have been sanctioned to the school. My Department has <Col N="1317"/>received two applications for additional special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy. The applications were received in November 2003 and February 2004.</P>
    <P>The SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Educational Psychological Service provides a service to the school attended by the named person. The school provides an excellent learning support service and children who are diagnosed with dyslexia receive further diagnostic testing and focused teaching within the school, in consultation with the area psychologist. A referral for individual psychological assessment is normally made only if the child is failing to make progress, even with learning support.</P>
    <P>Area psychologists discuss the needs of each school with the principal and they agree on a work plan for the school year, including any assessment work that is regarded by the school as a priority. There is no limit to the amount of assessments that may be carried out in schools served by NEPS, apart from the obvious constraint of time. However, because of the concerns expressed in this case, the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school will visit it before the end of this term to discuss the case and to ascertain what further assessment, if any, is needed.</P>

Included in the pilot scheme is the area around the N4 from Leixlip through Kilcock, Enfield, Longwood, Kinnegad and Rochfortbridge to Kilbeggan. It will also include schools in the Maynooth area. The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties in the locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Following the consultation process, individual plans will set out the blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area covering a period of up to ten years.</P>

	<P>When publishing the 2004 school building programme, I outlined that my strategy going forward will be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. My officials are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005 and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year. This multi-annual building programme, when published, will provide a comprehensive picture detailing all planned building projects in the Kildare area.</P>
    <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial. In addition, all post-primary schools in County Kildare now have access to the National Educational Psychological Service.</P>
    <P>My Department also allocates resource teaching support and special needs assistants support to second level schools and vocational educational committees to cater for students with special educational needs. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil(s) involved and the nature and level of support provided is determined on the advice of the National Educational Psychological Service.</P>

	<P>The school planning section of my Department is responsible for planning the provision of suitable cost effective <Col N="1331"/>accommodation both in response to applications from school managerial authorities for accommodation and by analysis of changing demographics. All resultant projects whether extensions to existing schools or new schools, including provision for pupils with special needs, are prioritised by reference to published criteria. These criteria are structured to ensure that schools most in need of accommodation are assigned a band 1 priority rating.</P>
    <P>The 2004 school building programme, which I published last December, is a further major step in progressing this Government&rsquo;s consistent commitment since 1997 to deal with school accommodation needs. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give assurance that the building programme is being operated in an open and transparent manner. The level of capital funding being provided nationally at primary and post-primary level in 2004 amounts to &euro;388 million, in excess of &euro;200 million of this will be targeted at primary level projects.</P>
    <P>The level of capital investment in schools including those providing for special needs pupils, has progressively increased since 1998 to a total of almost &euro;2 billion, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>A key part of my strategy going forward will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects covering the years 2004 to 2008. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing my Department is how to ensure the State gets best return on investment in educational infrastructure. New ways such as the devolved building initiative for small rural schools and the permanent accommodation initiative, both initiated in 2003 and expanded this year, show the Department&rsquo;s commitment to find innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
    <P>The school planning section of my Department is responsible for planning the provision of suitable cost effective accommodation both in response to applications from school managerial authorities for accommodation and by analysis of changing demographics. All resultant projects, whether extensions to existing schools or new schools in rapidly developing areas, are prioritised by reference to published criteria. These criteria are structured to ensure that schools most in need of accommodation are assigned a band 1 priority rating.</P>
    <P>In fulfilment of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackle sub-standard school accommodation the level of capital investment in schools has progressively increased since 1998 to a total of almost &euro;2 billion, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. The position in relation to any school or category of school is that their needs must be processed as part of the overall programme and must be assessed individually within the published prioritisation criteria.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s school building programme of &euro;388 million will deliver in excess of 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary level. In excess of 200 of these projects will commence on site in the current year, the remaining projects having commenced in previous years and are currently nearing completion. Furthermore, approximately an additional 600 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme directly by means of temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation and-or improvement works and all primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing my Department is how to ensure the State gets best return on investment in educational infrastructure. New ways such as the devolved building initiative for small rural schools and the permanent accommodation initiative, both initiated in 2003 and expanded this year, show the Department&rsquo;s commitment to find innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy.</P><Col N="1334"/>
    <P>My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under- investment in school infrastructure. The announcement in the last budget in relation to a multi-annual capital envelope will greatly assist my Department in addressing school accommodation needs in a programmed and systematic way.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The education system here is keeping pace with Ireland&rsquo;s competitors. It is worth noting that the annual competitiveness report 2003 ranks Ireland as first out of 12 countries examined concerning the proportion of science and engineering graduates per 1,000 of the population aged 20 to 34.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, established on a statutory basis in 2001, is committed to continuous review of curriculum and assessment provision in line with best international practice, and to ensuring that the education system remains a key factor in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic development. There have been significant curricular reforms in recent years, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry, implementation of a revised junior certificate science syllabus in the majority of schools in 2003-04 as well as a revised syllabus in science in primary schools from 2003-04. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers and have been accompanied by significant resourcing over the period 1999 to date.</P>
    <P>The range of ICT equipment available to support learning under successive school ICT initiatives at both levels of the system has expanded greatly and includes computers, the Internet, peripheral devices, multimedia, and a range of assistive technologies. Some &euro;140 million has been invested in this area to date, 34,000 teachers have availed of ICT training, all schools are connected to the Internet and the average pupil to computer ratios are now reduced to 12:1 and 9:1 in primary and post-primary schools respectively. In February 2004 a new schools broadband access programme was agreed which will provide for an &euro;18 million industry-Government investment fund to provide high speed broadband connectivity to all first and second level schools. NCCA guidelines for teachers have also been issued providing examples of how children in classrooms around the country are using ICT to add value to their learning with the primary school curriculum.</P><Col N="1335"/>
    <P>Within the third level sector, an unprecedented &euro;600 million has been allocated under the programme for research in third level institutions to provide integrated institutional strategies, programmes and infrastructure to build the capacity of the sector to support world class strategic research, innovation and development in Ireland, as well as promoting greater inter disciplinary and inter-institutional co-operation. This has enabled funding to be provided for 33 research centres across many disciplines, 62 new and expanded research programmes have been established, more than 4,000 peer-reviewed publications have been issued, and some 901 post-graduate and 475 post-doctorate researchers have been funded. This investment is supplemented by funds from the HEA block grant, the Irish research councils and from other sources.</P>
    <P>The OECD in-depth review of higher education under way is set in the context of assessing the strategic capacity of the third level sector to support lifelong learning and the transition to the knowledge society. My Department is committed to ensuring that Ireland continues to provide a high quality education system which promotes fulfilled personal development, economic competitiveness and social cohesion.</P>

	<P>A range of actions is being taken to promote an increased uptake of science in second level schools, in line with the recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences. In particular, important progress is being made in regard to the following: curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry, revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04, and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus, all of which developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers, resourcing, with substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002, an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate, and a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment, allied with the announcement in 2003 of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost in the order of &euro;12 million to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus &mdash; to date some 614 schools in the free education scheme have opted to provide the revised junior certificate science <Col N="1336"/>syllabus from 2003-04, grants of &euro;5.1 million were issued to these schools at the end of January 2004 and a further tranche of payments to certain schools is being processed, as a result of which the revised junior certificate science syllabus provides for a more investigative approach to science education with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme, a hands-on approach which is seen as critically important to enhance the attractiveness of the subject and encourage more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle; ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative, and the new TV scope programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; wareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; the launch of the new discover science and engineering programme in October 2003 bringing together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy; and the announcement by the T&aacute;naiste in December 2003 of plans for Ireland&rsquo;s first interactive learning centre for children and adults, designed to give visitors a hands-on experience and understanding of science, and to be an education and outreach centre for teachers and pupils &mdash; the exploration station is due to open in 2006 and will be sited in the OPW Heuston gate development in Kilmainham, Dublin.</P>
    <P>This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</P>

    <P>I am aware that, during this development phase of NEPS, some schools have experienced difficulties in accessing psychological assessments. I have therefore provided funding so that those schools that do not yet have direct access to the NEPS service can avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, which NEPS administers, pending the full expansion of the NEPS service to all schools. This is an interim arrangement and is not a substitute for a full educational psychological service. NEPS has circulated details of SCPA to all schools and full information is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>My Department received more than 8,400 applications for special education resources since 15 February, 2003. The batch of approximately 5,000 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. Priority was given to almost 1,000 cases involving children starting school last September and all those cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications in that batch has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. Those applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of such provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted <Col N="1338"/>incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs. It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils, and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this timeframe.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear, at every opportunity, that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are <Col N="1340"/>targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels.</P>
    <P>The overall pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has been improved significantly in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 18.0:1 in the 2002-03 school year. The projected ratio for the current school year is 17.44:1. The overall pupil teacher ratio at second level has also been improved significantly in recent years. The ratio fell from 16.0:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2002-03 school year. The ratio for the 2003-04 school year has further reduced to 13.48:1.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing provision for disadvantage at primary level, 311 designated disadvantaged primary schools have 293 concessionary teaching posts, which are not determined by reference to enrolment. Class sizes in 32 primary schools are considered for staffing with reduced pupil teacher ratios of 15:1 in junior and 27:1 in senior classes and a further 209 schools are considered for staffing with reduced pupil teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. These ratios remain unchanged for the 2004-05 school year. At second level, the disadvantaged area scheme benefits 211 schools serving approximately 96,000 pupils by providing over quota teaching posts.</P>
    <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to seek further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and having regard to priorities of need within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. A detailed review of all education disadvantage schemes is nearing completion and this will impact on existing schemes. I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The European eel is one of the truly indigenous freshwater fish species found in Ireland. It has been an integral part of life in rural communities for thousands of years. There is increasing scientific evidence presented at national and international levels of a serious and sustained decline in eel populations, not just in Ireland, but throughout Europe. At present the European eel stock is outside safe biological limits. Its collapse was variously attributed to anthropogenic factors such as over-fishing, pollution, obstacles to migrating eels, introduced Asian pathogens and to global environmental problems. Opinions differ on the relative importance of these factors.</P>
    <P>The consensus view among European fishery scientists researching eel populations is that there is an urgent need to increase the numbers of potential spawning silver eel successfully migrating from European waters. An overall management programme for the species must also be achieved through implementation of various management measures at local and national levels.</P>
    <P>On 2 October 2003 the European Commission adopted a communication on the development of a community action plan for the management of European eels in response to the advice. The Commission proposes that eel management be built up from a set of local actions to be put in place by the member states according to an agreed standard. These actions should ensure the survival and the migration of the eel in all its habitats.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing awareness in Ireland of the value of eel fishing and considerable concern for the status of stocks here. My predecessor established the Irish eel review group to examine the activities of the industry and to arrive at clear, realistic and costed proposals for the sustainable development and regulation of the resource. Earlier this year it submitted a report to my Department. At present my Department is examining it. The recommendations shall be considered in the context of the European Commission&rsquo;s action plan for the management of the European eel resource.</P>

	<P>I have informed the House of my intention to bring forward proposals to establish a new agency with responsibility for all maritime safety and coast guard matters. The proposals will include locating the agency headquarters in Drogheda.</P>
    <P>The decision to locate the agency in Drogheda was taken for operational reasons. It also reflects Government decentralisation policies. The agency will be able to undertake the necessary safety inspections of vessels visiting our east coast ports in particular. These ports handle 95% of maritime passenger traffic and over half of the total cargo traffic, much of which moves through Dublin port. The agency will also be able to deliver on its marine emergency management role, particularly in responding to any shipping incidents and oil pollution in the Irish Sea. It was identified as the area of highest risk around the coastline because of the level of maritime traffic moving in the area.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s maritime safety directorate will be part of the new agency. Last year it opened an office in Cork and it will open one in Ballyshannon, County Donegal. It will provide the necessary safety services to shipping and the leisure craft sector on our south, west and north coasts.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an agency will require legislation to be enacted and it is not possible to say how long it will take. Officials in my Department are already engaged in the detailed preparatory work. I intend to bring the detailed proposals to Government as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The 2004 national lottery funded <Col N="1343"/>sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 30 November and 1 December 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 16 January 2004. A total of 1,304 applications were received before the deadline. They were evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, that were outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions. On 7 May 2004 I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;50.8 million to 717 sporting and voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>I will shortly announce funding for projects of major significance under the 2004 sports capital programme. They met local needs but they will also add considerably to the national and regional sporting infrastructure that is required to increase levels of participation and improve standards of performance.</P>
    <P>In keeping with Government policy, the allocations reflect special priority for the development of sports and recreational facilities in areas designated as disadvantaged such as RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and local drugs task force areas. Projects that were allocated sports capital funding in designated disadvantaged areas may also receive additional top-up funding under the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes, administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A statement will issue from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, at a later stage regarding top-up funding allocations under these programmes.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 2003 sports capital programme, and following representations from the FAI, I agreed to provide an additional &euro;3 million to assist all of the clubs from the FAI premier division and the Eircom League in the upgrading of facilities to meet specific UEFA licensing requirements. A sum of &euro;8.95 million was allocated to other soccer projects in 2003.</P>
    <P>In December 2003 the FAI made recommendations about the distribution of the funding in the light of club reports outlining necessary works and the immediate demands placed on clubs qualifying for European competitions in 2004. The Department sought clarification from the FAI on a number of issues surrounding the overall implementation of the UEFA licensing and the specific projects involved. Contacts with the FAI on these issues is ongoing.</P>
    <P>It is my Department&rsquo;s priority to finalise the allocation of the &euro;3 million set aside in 2003 and to ensure that it is allocated and drawn down by Eircom League clubs to meet UEFA licensing demands in the context of a structured plan for its implementation across both of its divisions. So far this year grants totalling &euro;8.05 million have been made towards the development of soccer facilities throughout the country. I will shortly announce more funding for projects of major significance.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 to 280, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. It is advertised on an annual basis. A review was completed at the end of 1998. Since then applications for funding each year have been evaluated against detailed assessment criteria published in the guidelines, terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>The 2002 sports capital programme was administered by the then Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The initial assessment of applications received was based on an assumed commitment availability of about &euro;57.5 million which was the value of recommendations made. Subsequently additional <Col N="1348"/>funding of &euro;17.3 million was made available. It was reallocated to other projects on the basis of an assessment of factors such as the contribution to local community development, support for minority sports and the strength of local support. The initial assessment recommended funding for 625 projects. As many as 859 projects were approved and included all of the projects recommended in the initial assessment.</P>
    <P>None of the projects awarded provisional grant allocations under the programme may access any of the funding until they demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions communicated to them by the Department. The conditions include compliance with public tendering processes, legal and tax clearance requirements and the submission of invoices in respect of completed work on the project.</P>
    <P>The dates for the 2002 sports capital programme were brought forward specifically to facilitate the early announcement of financial allocations. This was done to give the grantees a better opportunity for speedier progress with their projects particularly during the summer months. I shall also explain it in my reply to Question No. 282.</P>

     <asker>Ms Lynch</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
     <Quest>his views on whether a club (details supplied) had sufficient funding to justify a substantial grant under the sports capital programme in 2002 and 2003.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14451/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme is administered by my Department. It allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. It is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>My Department evaluates applications in accordance with published assessment criteria. To obtain an assessment score applicants must meet basic qualifying conditions. One of these is to have the minimum level of funding. Applicants from designated disadvantaged areas must demonstrate that they have a minimum of 20% of the estimated project cost and other applicants must have 30%.</P>
    <P>The club in question applied under the 2002 and 2003 sports capital programmes. Both applications showed evidence of having more the minimum of 30% of the project cost. Subsequently the club received grant allocations of &euro;300,000 in 2002 and &euro;250,000 in 2003 for the construction of a clubhouse.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the <Col N="1349"/>national lottery funded sports capital programme. It allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. It is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2001 sports capital programme, and indeed for the 1999 and 2000 programmes prior to that, was early February. In 2002 the date set for receipt of applications was brought forward to early January. It facilitated the earlier announcement of financial allocations under the programme and gave the grantees a better opportunity for speedier progress with their projects, particularly during the summer months.</P>
    <P>This year&rsquo;s closing date for receipt of applications was 16 January. In 2003, mindful of the requirement to curb the growth of public expenditure generally, it was decided to postpone the closing date to the end of April, two months more than had been the practice prior to 2002. This was done to ensure that expenditure on the programme during the year was contained within approved limits.</P>

	<P>Female genital mutilation is a harmful traditional practice that constitutes an assault causing serious harm. It is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may prosecute any person who performed it in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Reception and Integration Agency operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am advised that it has disseminated an information and education booklet to health board liaison officers. The booklet entitled Understanding Female Genital Mutilation was published by Comhl&aacute;mh. The agency meets the liaison officers on a regular basis. The booklet is intended to provide an overview of some of the issues surrounding the complexity of the practice, particularly for health professionals and others working in the field. It is also aimed at others interested in becoming, or who are already, involved in actions to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the practice and its elimination.</P>
    <P>Treoir prepared an information pack on positive options in a crisis pregnancy. On 25 February Teoir hosted a seminar to finalising the pack and to target minority ethnic individuals and communities. An officer from the agency attended. The information pack and accompanying CD ROM includes information on <Col N="1350"/>female genital mutilation. They will be translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Romanian and Russian.</P>

	<P>The number of smear tests carried out nationally has increased by almost 20% in recent years. To meet the increased demand additional cumulative funding of &euro;11 million was provided by my Department since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. The funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel, to purchase new equipment and to introduce new technology and thereby increase the volume of activity. In addition, a number of hospitals have undertaken initiatives such as contracting out the analysis of smear tests to external laboratories. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in waiting times. For example, the waiting time for routine results at Cork University Hospital was reduced from 129 days at March 2003 to now less than 40 days.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Nicotine replacement therapies are available to medical card holders. The cardiovascular health strategy group recommended that an advisory forum be established to support the task force in the implementation of the strategy. A decision was taken after its recommendations to supply NRTs.</P>
    <P>There is a common list of reimbursable medicines for the general medical services and drug payment schemes. This ensures equity in the range of medicines paid for by the State. In order for a product to be included on the list it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public by medical prescription only and that it should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
    <P>NRTs would not normally satisfy these criteria as they are generally available over-the-counter and may be advertised directly to the public. Recommendations were made to the Minister and he decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of NRTs available on prescription to medical card holders. Evidence shows that lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. It is considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance to quit smoking. At present there are no plans to make NRTs available under the other community drug schemes.</P>

Caution should be exercised in comparing employment levels over the two years as changes in grade classifications have given rise to a lack of continuity in the data series. A substantial volume of home help services are delivered through voluntary agencies that are not recorded in the census. The figures set out above relate to wholetime equivalents so the numbers of hours worked relate to a full working week of 39 hours.</P>

	<P>In 1999 the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs introduced the respite care grant for <Col N="1356"/>recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance. In 2000 it was extended to beneficiaries of domiciliary care allowance. At the time the following was decided: the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would be responsible for paying the respite care grant to those providing care who are beneficiaries of the carers allowance or benefit only, or the carers allowance or benefit and domiciliary care allowance; and the Department of Health and Children, via health boards, would be responsible for paying the respite care grant to those providing care who are beneficiaries of domiciliary care allowance but who are not in receipt of the carers allowance or benefit.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid to recipients up to the age of 16 years. Therefore, the respite care grant cannot be paid by the health board after the child reached that age. To be eligible for the grant from the Department of Social and Family Affairs the applicant must be in receipt of the carers allowance or the carers benefit.</P>

    <P>Children have been identified as a priority group and guidelines on food and nutrition for <Col N="1357"/>pre-school and primary schools have been developed.

Inpatient treatment is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital. Beds are allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the provision of funding for services to people with an intellectual disability, including people with autism, and health related support services is a matter for the North Western Health Board. Additional funding of around &euro;16 million was provided since 1998 for services to children with intellectual disability and those with autism. Children with physical or sensory disabilities have also benefited from the additional funding provided for those services in recent years.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to children and adults with disabilities, including autism, is the shortage of certain professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places. Last year the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increases in speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the three year period to end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>While there has been significant progress in enhancing the health related support services available to children with special needs, there is a need for a continued programme of investment in this area.</P>

The approval of the Government would be required for the introduction of a new State compensation scheme in addition to the <Col N="1360"/>existing serious physical assaults scheme. In late 2003, a draft Government memorandum was circulated. During the consultation process, complex legal and financial issues emerged in respect of aspects of the scheme proposed by the task force and their implications for the health service and the wider public service. At a meeting on 3 March last, I updated the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU on concerns that had been raised about the proposed scheme. My officials are discussing the matter with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. I expect to be in a position to provide a further update to staff representatives in the near future.</P>

	<P>The Government engaged in discussions with organisations representing hospital consultants in February of this year about having personal injury claims against them covered by the clinical indemnity scheme. As a result of the discussions, the Government agreed that caps should be placed on the maximum value of professional <Col N="1364"/>indemnity cover required by consultants to cover private practice. The decision was taken to allay concerns that the cover would become unaffordable, thereby threatening the viability of the independent health care sector. For all specialties, with the exception of obstetrics, consultants will be required to purchase cover to a limit of &euro;1 million in respect of all cases arising in a single calendar year, inclusive of costs. Obstetricians will be required to purchase cover to a limit of &euro;500,000 in respect of all cases arising in a single calendar year, also inclusive of costs. Insurers or indemnifiers covering consultant obstetricians will not be liable for the cost of more than three claims against any individual consultant, each of which exceed &euro;500,000 in a single calendar year.</P>

	<P>In 2001, the two remaining private hospitals which provide maternity services, Bon Secours Hospital in Cork and Mount Carmel Hospital in Dublin, informed the Department of Health and Children that they would be unable to secure public liability insurance cover at affordable premiums for 2002 if they were to continue to deliver babies. The closure of maternity units at the hospitals would have led to major difficulties for the public maternity services in Dublin and Cork which were, and still are, operating at full capacity. The Department put in place a scheme whereby the two hospitals contribute to a fund that should be sufficient to finance the expected level of claims arising from their obstetric units. As the fund might be exhausted by the cost of meeting claims, the State through the State Claims Agency will be liable for the balance of any claims which cannot be met from the fund. The arrangements have not been altered since their introduction and remain in place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The Department of Health and Children seeks to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics, nationally and in the Western Health Board, in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of such services will continue to be based on the prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines. The guidelines, which were issued in 1985, are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to provide timely treatment for them.</P>
    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than those in category B. The number of cases treated depends on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area. This is reflected in the treatment waiting list. The provision of orthodontic services is severely restricted as a consequence of the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. Therefore, a category C waiting list may not be maintained by some health boards. I have arranged for a copy of the 1985 guidelines to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of drug treatment services rests with the health boards in the first instance. I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that methadone is not prescribed for individuals whose primary addiction is cocaine. The authority&rsquo;s addiction services unit provides a range of services to those presenting with cocaine use problems. The treatment methodologies utilised for those with primary cocaine addiction are evidence-based and are in line with best international practice. The services are focused on psychological support, counselling interventions and referral to appropriate residential services.</P>
    <P>I am advised that a small number of individuals are presenting for treatment for cocaine misuse alone. The majority of service users presenting with problem cocaine use are individuals involved in poly-drug misuse, particularly opiate misuse. Their cocaine use is treated in the context of their overall treatment plan. The treatment plans may include methadone detoxification or maintenance therapies to address the individual&rsquo;s primary addiction to opiate drugs. I am further advised that the Irish College of General Practitioners has issued guidelines on the treatment of opiate users which describe the indications for methadone prescription and that cocaine related problems are not among those indications.</P>

     <Quest>if the process of reinstating inter-country adoptions between Belarus and Ireland will be speeded up by governmental intervention, in view of the delay by the Irish Adoption Board in fulfilling its obligations under the bilateral agreement between both States, including the delay in the issuing of its letter of guarantee to Belarus, the distress the extremely long process is causing to a number of families and in view of the fact that yet another month will go by if the documentation for some couples is not ready for diplomatic posting by the end of May 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335 and 336 together.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board entered into a working agreement with Belarus in 1999 to facilitate the adoption of children from Belarus to Ireland. The Adoption Board has informed me that the Belarussian authorities have raised a number of issues that are being followed up. This is the second time that the Belarussian authorities have suspended the acceptance of applications from Irish applicants. The issue about the deed of guarantee for post-placement reports has been resolved and a current deed is with the Belarussian authorities. Two outstanding issues remain. The choice of facilitators used by Irish applicants, which were previously agreed to by the Belarussian authorities, was a matter for Irish applicants. The Belarussian authorities are also concerned by the alleged rejection by Irish applicants of referrals of children, although few referrals are rejected by Irish applicants.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board has contacted the director of the Belarussian national adoption centre and the deputy minister in the Belarussian ministry of education for clarification on the exact nature of the problems. The board has requested an urgent meeting with the Belarussian authorities to resolve the issues which have been raised. In the meantime, the board has asked the Belarussian authorities to continue to accept adoption applications from Irish applicants, pending the meeting between both parties. The Irish Embassy in Moscow, which has responsibility for Belarus, is in contact with the Belarussian authorities in an effort to ensure the speedy resumption of adoptions. The Adoption Board will advise applicants as soon as it receives an update on the situation.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of services at Letterkenny General Hospital rests with the North Western Health Board. I gave approval in July 2003 to the board to proceed with the planning of an extension to the accident and emergency unit at the hospital. The board and its design team are carrying out an option appraisal to determine the preferred option for the location of the facility on the hospital site. The detailed <Col N="1372"/>design process will commence on satisfactory completion of the option appraisal. Approval to go to tender will be granted by my Department following receipt of a satisfactory proposal from the board within the approved budget costs.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The national roll-out of BreastCheck requires detailed planning to include essential infrastructure. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be at the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital in Cork, with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage will be counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick and south Tipperary. The South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening services in the present and future development of the hospital. The Department of Health and Children made available a capital grant of &euro;230,000 for the study to be undertaken by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. The study, which has been completed, was submitted to my Department at the end of March. A detailed brief is being prepared by BreastCheck and the hospital. The project is being considered by my Department in the context of the framework for capital investment 2004-08.</P>
    <P>An essential element of the roll-out of the programme is investment in education and training of radiographers. BreastCheck employs qualified and experienced radiographers who have specialised postgraduate training and qualifications related to mammography. BreastCheck and the symptomatic breast cancer services have a significant ongoing recruitment and training requirement in this area. I announced last year the development of a training centre for radiographers and mammography at Eccles Street which will become the national training centre in breast imaging. Resources are being made available to BreastCheck to support the initiative, which will cost in excess of &euro;750,000. Design specification work has been undertaken, the core elements of the training programme are being addressed and the recruitment process for a course leader has been initiated.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The adaptation of vehicles for persons with disabilities by the company referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is a day-to-day matter for the company. Services provided by the company are operated with coaches which are not available in readily accessible configuration. I indicated in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question No. 409 on 14 October 2003 that private bus operators are licensed to provide public transport services in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, which is under review. It is proposed to replace the Act, which does not make specific reference to the provision of accessible buses, with a new statutory framework for the independent regulation of bus services.</P>
    <P>I am committed to making public transport accessible for all categories of people with mobility impairments, such as the physically disabled, the sensory impaired, the elderly, parents with children, etc. I intend that the provision of accessible buses by bus operators will be addressed in detail in the context of the proposed new regulatory regime for bus services. When licences are being issued under the 1932 Act, my Department requests private operators to use low floor buses with accessibility features, where possible, in the provision of licensed bus services. When new vehicles are being purchased for licensed services, my Department requests that the buses accord with appropriate accessibility standards.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rules governing drivers&rsquo; hours, in accordance with Article 4.3 of Council regulation No. 3820/85, vehicles used for the carriage of passengers on regular services where <Col N="1376"/>the route covered by the service in question does not exceed 50 km are exempt from the regulation. As this exemption is applicable to the services being provided by Aircoach, my Department has no role in respect of carrying out inspections on the hours worked by Aircoach drivers. Where the relevant provisions apply, however, they are enforced and inspections are carried out for this purpose by officers of my Department.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together.</P>
    <P>Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding, seat belt wearing and insurance offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. The offence of not carrying or producing a driving licence does not attract penalty points. The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months have passed since the penalty points system was introduced in October 2002. At 29 April 2004, over 144,000 drivers had received penalty points, including one driver who had reached the 12-point threshold which leads to automatic disqualification. I intend to introduce penalty points for careless driving with effect from 1 June 2004. This measure should have a further positive influence on the driving <Col N="1377"/>behaviour of those who have little regard for road traffic law. The effectiveness of the penalty points system can be judged primarily on the basis of the contribution it has made to road safety since its introduction. In the 18 months since October 2002 the number of deaths as a result of road collisions has fallen by 114 by comparison to the previous 18-month period.</P>
    <P>Penalty point systems are now operating in this country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The authorities in all three jurisdictions are actively considering the issue of the introduction of a scheme to provide for the mutual recognition of penalty points between the UK and Ireland. This consideration is being pursued under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. One of the first matters that will need to be addressed before full mutual recognition can be realised will be the introduction of bilateral recognition of the separate systems operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

     <Quest>when his Department commissioned the new study into the Dublin Bus market; the terms of reference for this study; when he hopes to be in possession of the study; if the review of the 1932 Act is dependent on the outcome of the study; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the chairman of the Dublin Transportation Office on 23 March last, asking the office to carry out a review of the bus network in Dublin. The terms of reference for the review are as follows. The terms of reference set a target of January 2005 for the completion of the review, but the office has stated that it is likely to take some months longer to complete. The review of the Road Transport Act 1932 does not depend on the outcome of the bus network review.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the terms of reference for the strategic review of the bus network in the greater Dublin area. The purpose of the review will be to provide a strategic framework for the development of bus services in the greater Dublin area, having regard to the policy context provided by A Platform for Change, the national spatial strategy, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area and their statutory successor, local authority development plans and relevant integrated framework plans. The review will focus on the short to medium term. The short term refers to the period until the end of 2006, at least until the end of the current national development plan, and the medium term refers to the period at least until the end of 2010 and possibly to the end of the next plan period, which will be in 2012 or 2013.</P>
    <P>The review will make recommendations on the reconfiguration and development of the bus network with regard to the need for continuing expansion and improvement of public transport services in the greater Dublin area; the likely impact of the development of rail-based public transport; changes in land use; and other factors that the study team considers relevant or the study steering group directs. The review is not intended to produce a full bus network operational plan. It should be sufficiently detailed to provide a satisfactory framework for such a network plan; to provide a quantitative assessment of the range, amount and intensity of services required on all the main public transport corridors, both radial and orbital, and how they <Col N="1379"/>should be phased in over the period covered by the review; to give a clear understanding of how the bus network should be reconfigured and developed in the short to medium term; to quantify the broad financial and other resource requirements; and to identify any material operational and other issues requiring consideration and decision.</P>
    <P>The review will take account of the bus network strategy appraisal for the greater Dublin area, published by CIE in June 2000. The review will be expected to start from first base rather than simply to update the appraisal. The work on the review will be undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office, supported by consultants and overseen by a steering group. The review will be completed not later than the end of January 2005.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 6,840 peace commissioners are entered on the current roll of peace commissioners. The roll is appointment based and there is no statutory retirement age for peace commissioners. For that reason, and because my Department relies on the peace commissioners and other interested parties to advise of changes which occur subsequent to appointment, the roll is not automatically updated to take account of changes of address, availability or status as they occur. Peace Commissioner records are also maintained by reference to the Garda administrative areas in which peace commissioners reside. Some 146 peace commissioners are entered on the current roll of peace commissioners for the areas served by Garda stations located in Dublin postal districts 1, 3 and 7.</P>
    <P>Peace Commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. The <Col N="1380"/>office of peace commissioner is an honorary appointment and peace commissioners receive no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services. An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment. Nominations are generally received from public representatives. A local Garda superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.</P>
    <P>There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and are usually well established in the local community. Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation and civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an <i>ex officio</i> appointment. Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment. The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment because appointments are made at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and having regard to the needs of particular areas.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the safety of persons recently deported from the State. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged to consider the issue of risk to a person before, not after, a deportation order is made in respect of that person. The Minister is obliged to consider the prohibition of refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>The Immigration Act 1999 sets out the procedures involved in deporting a person. Where the Minister proposes to deport a person he or she is given three options: to make representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why he or she should not be deported that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, to leave the State voluntarily before the order is made or to consent to the making of a deportation order.</P>
    <P>Where representations are made setting out reasons why a person should not be deported, the Minister is obliged to consider a number of factors as specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s individual family and domestic circumstances, humanitarian considerations and the refoulement issue mentioned above.</P>

	<P>There are several provisions which set out an employer&rsquo;s statutory and common law duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of an employee from bullying, harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace. To comply with such provisions, the Civil Service policy document, entitled A Positive Working Environment, was introduced in June 2000. This policy is applicable to all civil servants, including prison officers.</P><Col N="1383"/>
    <P>The governor of a prison, on receipt of a complaint of bullying shall initially, and where appropriate, seek to resolve the matter informally with the consent of the parties involved. Where this is not possible, he or she will immediately institute a formal investigation using the procedures outlined in the Civil Service policy. Complaints of bullying by prison officers have been processed in this manner.</P>
    <P>The issue of a policy specifically designed for the Prison Service is the subject of ongoing discussions between management and prison staff associations. Such discussions are expected to conclude shortly.</P>

The estimation of the number of organised criminal groups existing at any given time forms part of criminal intelligence analysis which is an ongoing process in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda compiles an annual report on organised crime groups in Ireland based on intelligence and criminal investigations.

The father of the person in question applied for a short-term visa for the stated purpose of coming to the State to sit an examination. He entered the State on 4 April 2002. He applied for permission to reside based on parentage of the same Irish born child and this was granted on 29 November 2002. A visa application was submitted on behalf of the person in question to allow him to come and reside with his parents in the State.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp;  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of my Department does not generally approve visas in respect of such visa applications.</P>

	<P>The reception and integration agency, RIA, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. It has no role in respect of the provision of accommodation to former asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to social assistance payments is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. On 1 May 2004, on foot of a Government decision, the Minister introduced an habitual residency condition in relation to access to social assistance payments. This condition applies to all applicants for such payments and is not confined to European Union citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that citizens of the ten new EU member states who fail to qualify for social assistance payments on foot of the habitual residency condition would be referred to my Department who would support their repatriation on an agency basis for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This task is being undertaken by RIA. I understand that the Department of Social and Family Affairs has issued a circular in relation to the new arrangements to the chief executive officers of the health boards and to the community welfare officers who deal with applications for supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to nationals of the ten new EU member states is that since 1 May their <Col N="1386"/>immigration status is underwritten by EU treaty rights. These rights include a right to participate in the labour market. As no Irish citizen participating in the labour market is provided with full board accommodation on the style of the direct provision system funded by the taxpayer, it would be a manifest inequality to facilitate the continuance of such an arrangement for a national of a new EU member state who had applied for refugee status here prior to 1 May and whose rights of access to the labour market since that date is no different to an Irish citizen. In these circumstances the RIA has asked nationals from ten new EU member states to vacate their state funded direct provision accommodation as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>It is open to any person to seek enforcement of their constitutional rights through the courts. Since October 2000 direct and indirect discrimination in the provision of goods and services is prohibited under the Equal Status Act 2000 on nine grounds including disability. The Act covers all goods and services which are <Col N="1387"/>available to the public, whether on payment or not. Services are defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, travel, transport, professional services, education, disposal of premises and provision of accommodation and private registered clubs.</P>
    <P>A person who claims that he or she has been discriminated against in the non-employment area may seek redress by referring the case to the ODEI, the Equality Tribunal. The director has the power under the Equal Status Act to refer the case for mediation or to investigate and decide such a case. If the director finds in favour of the complainant, she may make an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination and/or order a specific course of action to be taken.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the ODEI, the Equality Tribunal, is an independent statutory office set up under the Employment Equality Act 1998 and that the director and her equality officers and equality mediation officers are independent in the performance of their functions. I have no statutory function in relation to such investigations and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any individual case. The Equality Authority, which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on any of the grounds covered in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area.</P>
    <P>Persons who wish to take a case under the Equal Status Act before the ODEI, the Equality Tribunal, may represent themselves, be represented by a solicitor or, in certain cases, request advice and possible representation from the Equality Authority.

    <P>The most accurate figures available to me relate to 17 May 2004. On that day there was a total of 38 persons in prison custody for non-payment of fines. Twelve of these persons were also serving sentences for other offences for which there was no option of paying a fine in lieu of imprisonment. A further two persons were also remanded in custody on other charges as well as serving sentences for defaulting on fine payments. There were ten persons in custody arising from civil proceedings for failure to pay debts. The total number of persons, 48, in custody on foot of either fine or debtor warrants equates to a percentage of just under 1.5% of persons in prison custody.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Applications for the grant of off-licences must be made to the District Court. Detailed provisions relating to application procedures and the conditions to be satisfied are set out in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2003.</P>
    <P>In its interim report on off-licensing the Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended significant changes in the law regulating access to off-licences. In particular, the commission recommended that it should no longer be necessary for an applicant for a full off-licence to cause an existing licence to be extinguished but that a meaningful fee should be payable by an applicant instead. I intend to address the commission&rsquo;s recommendations for reforming licensing law, including those relating to off-licences, in a Bill to codify the licensing laws which I will bring forward in the coming months.</P>

	<P>Local authorities have been requested to put in place and submit details of five year action plans covering the full range of their housing programmes to the Department by the end of May 2004. The development of these plans will enable local authorities to identify priority needs over the coming years and provide a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing sectors, including delivery by the voluntary and co-operative sector and use of private rental accommodation to meet long-term housing assistance needs. These plans, to be agreed with the Department, will ensure that a fully strategic approach is taken by local authorities to meeting housing needs in their areas and will ensure that they avail of the certainty provided by multi-annual expenditure programmes.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The contract for the supply nationally of the electronic voting machines followed a testing programme undertaken in relation to the functionality and durability of the machines, as well as their use on a pilot basis at polls in seven constituencies. I am satisfied that the contract includes appropriate provisions for the protection of customer interests. The contract sets out acceptance procedures, which include final performance testing by returning officers. Formal acceptance of the voting machines by a returning officer occurs only when the machines have been satisfactorily performance tested by the returning officer and the latter completes a certificate to that effect. The contract provides that any malfunction of the machines on delivery will be remedied by the suppliers at their expense and the warranty period on the machines extends to the end of 2007.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Electronic Voting, in its interim report, recorded that testing carried out by experts retained by the commission confirmed that the voting machine accurately and consistently records voter preferences, including at multiple simultaneous elections. The commission&rsquo;s recommendations for further testing in relation to the overall system related principally to the management and counting software rather than to the voting machines. In line with the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, it is intended that the voting machines will be used in <Col N="1392"/>future polls when the further programme suggested by the commission has been completed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the litter monitoring body, co-ordinated by my Department, which was published in July 2003, provides valuable statistical data in relation to litter pollution in Ireland. Chewing gum is identified in the report as the single largest litter component in the food litter category and, after cigarette related litter, is the second largest litter component nationally. Fast-food take-away bags and wrappers are identified as the largest litter component in the packaging litter category. ATM, automated teller machine receipts have also been identified in the report as significant elements of paper litter.</P>
    <P>On foot of the litter monitoring body report, I commissioned a consultancy study in September 2003 to carry out an analysis and recommend appropriate economic instruments, including environmental levies, that might be implemented to tackle the litter problems caused by these items. The consultants&rsquo; report was completed recently. It is now intended to announce a limited public consultation on the consultants&rsquo; report to obtain the views of relevant stakeholders and other interested parties. It is anticipated that proposals will be finalised by mid-year on foot of evaluating the submissions received during the public consultation process.</P>

	<P>Local authorities provide Traveller accommodation in accordance with their five-year Traveller accommodation programmes which are based on a prior assessment of need. This assessment takes into account both current and future need having regard to new family formations. While local authorities may not be in a position, in all cases, to make precise assessments of the category of accommodation required, programmes generally allow further consideration to be given to new <Col N="1393"/>identified needs for Traveller accommodation over the course of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The table provided sets out the overall Traveller accommodation needs, including projected future needs, identified by local authorities in their programmes in terms of the overall number of units required. The table also sets out the details of the permanent accommodation &mdash; standard local authority <Col N="1394"/>housing, group houses and halting site bays &mdash; provided by or with the assistance of the relevant housing authorities from the commencement of the programmes to the end of 2003. These figures which are taken from the annual count of Traveller families, undertaken by local authorities, and from other returns provided to my Department, also include houses provided by Travellers themselves with the assistance of local authorities.</P><Col N="1393"/>

	<P>Under section 4(1)(<i>j</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, development which consists of the use of any structure or other land within the curtilage of a house for any purpose incidental to the <Col N="1395"/>enjoyment of the house as such is exempted development and does not therefore require planning permission. Accordingly, the recycling by people of their own domestic waste, within the immediate area surrounding their houses, would not require planning permission. While there are currently no grants available to persons to recycle their domestic waste, many local authorities provide special composting vessels at a low or subsidised cost to householders for composting of their domestic waste.</P>

	<P>I assume that the question refers to the capital funding schemes for social housing projects, undertaken by non-profit voluntary and co-operative housing bodies, which are operated by my Department. Under the voluntary housing capital loan and subsidy scheme funding for up to 100% of the approved cost of a project for family type housing is available in respect of eligible projects. Funding is available for up to 95% of the approved costs of special needs and family type housing projects under the capital assistance scheme. Assistance under both schemes is subject to unit cost limits and compliance with the terms of the scheme. Funding provided by my Department under these capital funding schemes has increased significantly in recent years with an outturn in the order of &euro;92 million in 2000 compared with a provision of &euro;234 million in the current year.</P>

     <Quest>the action he is taking to promote higher standards in quality, design, safety and energy efficiency within the heating and plumbing installation industry; and if, in the domestic sector, all non-condensing boilers will be outlawed by 2005 and all manufacturing products in the industry will meet the Sedbuk A or B rating by 2005.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The formulation of revised quality, design, and safety standards for heating and plumbing installations would be a matter primarily for the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI. The European Communities (Efficiency Requirements for New Hot Water Boilers fired with Liquid or Gaseous Fuels) Regulations 1994 require that new domestic boilers installed on or after 1 August 1994 meet prescribed minimum efficiency requirements. The option of requiring boilers in new dwellings to meet the equivalent of the Sedbuk A or B rating in the United Kingdom and have a minimum efficiency of 86% or more will be considered in the context of the implementation of EU Directive 2002/91/EC of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings. This directive must be legally transposed by January 2006. If this option is pursued, I understand that it would be open to manufacturers to consider the feasibility of adapting non-condensing boilers to achieve the equivalent of the Sedbuk A or B rating.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Good Friday Agreement does not make any provision in relation to a person&rsquo;s eligibility to vote. Such issues are governed by the Constitution and by electoral law. Under electoral law, the compilation of a register of electors is a matter for the appropriate registration authority who may require a person to provide any information, including information in relation to residency and citizenship, in order to establish that they are entitled to be registered as an elector. Every citizen of Ireland over 18 years of age, whose name appears on the register, is entitled to vote at all polls. Inquiries in any specific case should be made directly to the appropriate registration authority.</P>

	<P>The termination of the new house grant scheme, which was announced on 14 November 2002, arose from the necessity, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, for the Government to ensure a sustainable match between expenditure and resources, and to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need. It is not proposed to review the basis on which the scheme was terminated or to reintroduce the grant.</P>

	<P>In those areas where a local authority collection service is in place, the determination of charges for the service is a matter for the local authority itself. In areas where the local authority is not involved in the collection service, the determination of charges is a matter for the private collectors concerned.</P>
    <P>In my recently published policy statement Taking Stock and Moving Forward I have set a target date of 1 January 2005 for the completion of the transition to use-based waste charges, either on the basis of weight or volume. As well as providing an important incentive to recycle, such charging regimes are also important from a charging equity point of view. In addition, I am currently considering, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, equity issues in relation to the waste charges waiver system.</P>
    <P>Taking Stock and Moving Forward also highlights the importance of guarding against anti-competitive practices in the waste sector, and in this regard I will be commissioning a comprehensive study of the waste sector later this year.</P>

	<P>The appointment of polling stations at the European and local elections is the responsibility of the local European returning officer. The number of polling stations to be used at the June polls is not therefore available in advance to my Department. Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996, local authorities, in making polling schemes, must endeavour to appoint as polling places only areas which will allow a returning officer to provide at each polling place at least one polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>Once in the polling station, persons with a physical disability may avail of companion voting or may seek the assistance of the presiding officer. Alternatively, if a person has a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station, the person can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors.</P>
    <P>The returning officer must give public notice of all polling stations in buildings which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to the assigned polling station he or she may then apply, in writing, for authorisation to vote at another station in an accessible building in the same constituency.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 192 of 6 May 2004. Contraction and convergence is a proposal for achieving global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, promoted primarily by the London-based Global Commons Institute, a non-governmental organisation. It is one of many potential models towards its stated purpose. The discussion at European heads of state level on necessary action to prevent dangerous interference with global climate systems is a more widely based one, and has been advanced during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>On 2 March 2004 the Environment Council, in preparing an input for the European Council and in reference to the development of medium and longer term emission reduction strategies, including targets, highlighted <i>inter alia </i>the need to ensure that overall global temperature increase should not exceed 2ºC above pre-industrial levels, and to take into account the findings of the intergovernmental panel on climate change.</P>
    <P>The European Council on 25/26 March 2004 confirmed that it looks forward to considering such emission reduction strategies, including targets, at its spring meeting in 2005. The Commission has been invited to prepare a cost benefit analysis, which takes account both of environmental and competitiveness considerations.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made in other areas of the international climate agenda during the Irish Presidency, including a first reading agreement between the Council and the European Parliament on a directive linking the Kyoto Protocol project mechanisms Joint Implementation, JI, and the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM, to the new European emissions trading scheme. This will encourage investment in sustainable development globally with the specific aim of achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the recognition of credits from approved emissions reductions projects in the European scheme.</P>
    <P>Consideration of options for further action post-2012, the end of the first Kyoto period, <Col N="1401"/>underway since autumn 2002, continues to be undertaken by a working party reporting to the Environment Council. Contraction and convergence continues to be considered in that context.</P>

	<P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by individual local authorities. The framework for the operation of the scheme is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. My Department recoups to authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Capital funding of &euro;65 million has been provided for the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2004. Returns have now been received from all local authorities detailing their expenditure on these schemes in 2003 and their estimated requirements for 2004. On the basis of these returns, individual allocations, now being finalised, will be notified to authorities shortly. It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided in their areas for each of the grant schemes from within this allocation.</P>
    <P>The improvements which have been made in recent years to the maximum disabled persons grant and the level of recoupment available have <Col N="1402"/>resulted in increased levels of demand with expenditure on the scheme increasing from &euro;13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to over &euro;50 million for over 5,700 grants in 2003. In line with this very significant increase in my Department&rsquo;s capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;37.5 million for 6,153 grants in 2003. In that time the maximum grant has doubled from &euro;10,158 to &euro;20,320. These increases in the levels of funding provided are a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the disabled persons grant scheme.</P>
    <P>A review of the disabled persons grant scheme is being finalised in my Department at present. On its completion, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme to ensure that the funding available is directed at those persons in greatest need of such assistance.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Ulster-Scots Agency is one of the agencies of An Foras Teanga, the North-South language body set up under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, the other agency being Foras na Gaeilge. I would like to clarify that there is no cutback in funding to the Ulster-Scots Agency this year.</P>
    <P>The Ulster-Scots Agency, which is jointly funded North &mdash; 75% &mdash; and South &mdash; 25% &mdash; by the two Governments, has a total budget of &euro;2.470 million for 2004, an increase of 2.9% over its provision for 2003. The allocation of this provision to individual projects is a matter for the agency itself, in accordance with its approved business plan.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Ulster-Scots Agency that the border minority group to which the Deputy refers seeks to advance education and cultural awareness in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim and to promote tourism and awareness of the culture of the minority community in these counties. During the past two years the agency has awarded some £67,323, the current equivalent of which is &euro;99,062, by way of grants to support such initiatives as Ulster-Scots concerts, highland dance tuition, community events, music workshops-tuition. A substantial amount, some £58,000, the current equivalent of which is &euro;85,344, of funding was allocated to support the employment of a development officer, on condition that alternative funding sources would be found in the future.</P>
    <P>While the agency has expressed its awareness of the excellent work carried out during the past 18 months by the incumbent of the development officer post, it has indicated that with a limited budget and an ever-increasing client base, it is not possible for it to continue to provide ongoing financial support for posts of this nature.</P>

However, the new provisions do not restrict the discretion given to health boards to award a supplement in any case where it appears to the board that the circumstances of the case so warrant e.g. where an applicant is <Col N="1407"/>being made homeless or forced to use homeless facilities unless rent supplement is paid.</P>
    <P>Naturally, it is expected that the type of cases referred to should, by their nature, be exceptional and it would be expected that the number of such cases would be minimal.</P>
    <P>The health boards have indicated that the housing authorities are responding to requests for housing assessments without undue delay. If, however, there is a delay in any particular case, a health board still has the discretion to make a payment where it considers it necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the implementation of the new measures to ensure that they are effective and do not lead to hardship in individual cases.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>the reason for the decision by her Department to withdraw allowances for cr&egrave;che payment to mothers availing of back to education schemes; and if this payment of cr&egrave;che charges is being provided by another Department to mothers in back to education schemes who have young children in cr&egrave;che facilities.</Quest>

	<P>The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, under which cr&egrave;che supplements are paid, is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case.</P>
    <P>The cr&egrave;che supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to a parent who is in need of a short-term emergency support. This could arise, for example, where, without assistance with child minding, a parent would not be able to avail of necessary particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>It was never intended to be a long-term ongoing support for people returning to full-time education.</P>
    <P>When the change was announced in November 2003, there were 1,738 cr&egrave;che supplements in payment. This figure represented an increase of almost 150% in less than three years from January 2001 when there were approximately 700 people in receipt of a cr&egrave;che supplement. Payment of cr&egrave;che supplements were increasingly being made for reasons which were clearly outside the scope of the original intentions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact that the supplements were in payment for long durations in many cases indicated that they had become a long term childcare support rather than the short term social welfare support which was originally intended.</P>
    <P>This is not an appropriate way for meeting the needs of the people in question. However, cr&egrave;che supplements in payment prior to 1 January 2004 <Col N="1408"/>have been allowed to remain in payment for a limited period.</P>
    <P>While the total amount spent on cr&egrave;che supplements is significant, with some &euro;2.1 million spent in 2003, funding cr&egrave;ches in this manner is administratively inefficient as it requires the parents to apply individually for a weekly payment. The cost of administration represents a high proportion of the value of the funds provided to the cr&egrave;ches.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has introduced the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006 to fund the development of childcare in Ireland while seeking to ensure that existing child care services are not displaced by the introduction of new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the programme is to provide childcare facilities which will allow parents to avail of educational, training and employment opportunities. In this regard the equal opportunities childcare programme is the more appropriate vehicle to address the needs of the people identified by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Discussions are continuing with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children and from some of the health boards to ensure that more appropriate arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that the changes I introduced in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in no way affect the discretion available to health boards to provide assistance in emergency cases which may arise from time to time.</P>

     <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kildare is not being awarded a rent subsidy in view of the fact this person&rsquo;s local authority states that they are in need of housing; if this is not accepted by her Department, the proper procedure this person has to follow to ensure that they receive the rent subsidy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that it is aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy. However, the information available to the board is that the person concerned has not actually been assessed by the local housing authority in respect of her housing needs.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the local authority to deem an applicant to be in need of housing. For rent supplement purposes, it is necessary that an assessment of housing need is undertaken by the local authority. The board is awaiting the outcome of this assessment before it will be in a position to determine whether or not a rent supplement is payable in this case.</P>

     <Quest>the reason the supplementary welfare allowance appeal by a person (details supplied) in County Dublin was refused, in view of the circumstances; if he intends to review the situation in view of the hardship being experienced by this person&rsquo;s family and the fact that a loan has had to be taken out to pay for the rent; and the other course of action she recommends.</Quest>

	<P>It is a statutory condition for receipt of a rent allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme that a person has not vacated accommodation provided by a housing authority or if he or she has vacated such accommodation the health board is satisfied that he or she had good cause for doing so.</P>
    <P>The person concerned applied for a rent allowance in respect of her current accommodation in October 2003. This application was disallowed by the South Western Area Health Board on the basis that she had vacated her previous local authority house voluntarily and without having good cause for doing so.</P>
    <P>The person appealed against this decision and her appeal was considered by the health board&rsquo;s appeals officer who upheld the decision. The person then appealed to the chief appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office. Following an oral hearing on 10 March 2004 an appeals officer, having considered all the available evidence and the circumstances of the case, determined that it had not been established that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; existed for the person to vacate the accommodation provided by the local authority in Athlone. Accordingly, the appeal was disallowed.</P>
    <P>An appeals officer&rsquo;s decision is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or evidence. A review of the decision was recently carried out at the request of the person concerned. The appeals officer decided that there was no new information that would warrant a revision of his decision and she was advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

     <Quest>if part-time public sector employees who have been paying PRSI Class A contributions while their full time colleagues have been paying PRSI Class D contributions have been or will be required to pay Class D contributions as a result of changes brought about by the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</Quest>
     <QRef>[14488/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Employment protection legislation including the Protection of Employee (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 falls within the policy responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The legislation seeks to implement the provisions of the EU Directive, 97/81/EC which, in effect, established a right for part-time workers to be treated comparably with full-time workers and to enjoy the same conditions of employment in respect of remuneration and related matters including occupational pensions.</P>
    <P>The framework agreement upon which the directive is based specifically excludes social security systems from its scope. Accordingly, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 has no direct implication for the operation of the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>The provisions governing social insurance are included in social welfare legislation which is of course the responsibility of my Department. Generally speaking this legislation provides that different categories of employed and self-employed workers are insured for the social welfare benefits and pensions most appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person employed in a local or public authority in a permanent position on 5 April 1995 and continues to be so employed, is generally speaking, insurable at the &ldquo;modified&rdquo; or PRSI Class D rate of contribution. The modified rate of contribution applies equally to all public servants regardless of whether they work full- time or part-time.</P>
    <P>All new public sector employees recruited after 5 April 1995, be they part-time or full-time workers, pay PRSI at Class A providing their earnings are over &euro;38 per week. These contributions can provide entitlement to disability benefits and other payments to which modified contributors are not entitled. The change in PRSI contributions for public servants <Col N="1411"/>was introduced on foot of a recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare and supported by the National Pensions Board, which concluded that this change would support a greater sense of social solidarity within the PRSI system and promote the mobility of employees between the public and private sectors. Following detailed <Col N="1412"/>consultation with staff interests, the revised arrangements were brought into operation in April 1995. Since then the number of public servants paying PRSI at modified PRSI of contribution is already declining and Class A social insurance cover will represent the norm throughout the private and public sectors.</P>
