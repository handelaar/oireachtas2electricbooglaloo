	<P>I have received from Deputy Gay Mitchell, who was suspended from the service of the D&aacute;il yesterday for disregarding the authority of the Chair, a written and approved expression of regret. In accordance with Standing Order 61(3)(<i>b</i>), I must now move: &ldquo;That the order of the D&aacute;il of 7 April suspending Deputy Gay Mitchell from the service of the D&aacute;il be discharged&rdquo;. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 8<i>b</i>, motion re sittings and business of the D&aacute;il; No. 14, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 16, Equality Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 8<i>b</i>, including any amendments thereto, shall be decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and that the resumed Second Stage of No. 14 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8<i>b</i> agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. I have received a notice from M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Ainif&iacute;n, Aire St&aacute;it ag Roinn an Taoisigh, in respect of the recall of the D&aacute;il on 21 and 22 April. This comes after much obfuscation and lack of clarity on the part of the Government over the past fortnight as to the sittings of the D&aacute;il after Easter. The question was pursued relentlessly by Deputy Rabbitte before the truth was finally dragged out of the Government.</P><Col N="1138"/>
    <P>The Government expects Members to return on 21 and 22 April and to sit from 10.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m. to facilitate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. There will be no Order of Business, no Leaders&rsquo; Questions, no oral or written questions, no Private Members&rsquo; Business, no matters under Standing Order 31&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Just a little chit chat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>A sham.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the taking of any divisions will be postponed until 27 April. What in the name of God does the Government think we are? We have repeatedly asked questions about Government business and how it is being conducted, yet we are expected to return to the House on 21 and 22 April and sit here like lame ducks to listen to dictator McDowell read his script and bulldoze the Bill through by postponing votes until the following week. I object to this. It is outrageous behaviour by a Government which has lost touch with how this House is run. Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have no concern other than to send in the Minister to read his script, bulldoze the business through the House and to hell with parliamentary democracy. I object.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears that there is no respect on the Government side for this institution. It is extraordinary. There are no written questions today and, having concealed from the House its intentions in respect of the citizenship referendum, the Government is doing precisely what I said it would do two weeks ago. It will recall the House a week early to take the Bill, which it had earlier denied it would do. If I knew it, I do not believe that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, did not know it.</P>
    <P>Now, Members are being summoned to the House for a sitting in which none of the normal business will be transacted. There will be no Question Time and no Order of Business. What if a vote is called? Let us suppose my party were to call a vote, as it is considering, on taking Second Stage of the Bill. There is precedent for that. The Chair will postpone the vote until the following week, after we have had the Second Stage discussion. The Members, therefore, will debate Second Stage for two days and then the House will vote a week later on whether it should take Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government is reducing the House to a farce. I, Deputy Kenny, Deputy Sargent and others will be here debating the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s brainwave to shore up Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s working class support while the lads are slithering around the doors because they do not have to be here. They will be slithering around while the Opposition keeps the House going.</P>

  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be whispering the usual behind their hands, &ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;d send them all back if it was not for the Labour Party.&rdquo; It is a disgrace that the House is being reduced in this fashion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a case, though it would be misinterpreted by our vigilant friends in the media, for the Opposition parties saying we will leave the House to the Government on the week after Easter, as we have no rights at all in the House. There is a 50-50 chance that some sections of the media would report it as us not being available to tog out, which is not the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GVWright"><NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. What is the point of coming to the House if we cannot observe the modicum of protocol which is part and parcel of the House? The Taoiseach presents the Order of Business, we respond to it and if there are votes then those votes are taken. We should be permitted our normal Question Time, Adjournment Debates and so on. This shows disgraceful disrespect for the institution of Parliament and reveals the naked purpose of what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are about. Their purpose is to exploit for electoral advantage a sensitive issue which, if we must have a referendum, ought to be prosecuted in a calmer environment outside the normal frenzy associated with adversarial elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party agrees with previous speakers on the need to protest violently against this proposal and I use the word &ldquo;violently&rdquo; because we see here a cynical, ramrod attempt to distort the Constitution, the basic law of the country.</P>
    <P>There are processes involved in informing any public debate, such as producing a Green or White Paper or referring to the established All-Party Committee on the Constitution. After 17 months of considerations that committee produced its ninth volume in a series yesterday, and the previous eight volumes contained dozens of proposals to change the Constitution. Now this cynical, nasty Government wants public discourse on the nature of Irish citizenship over eight weeks.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte. There is a case for considering what role the Opposition should play in the House over the two days of this proposed debate, though it is not a debate. It is an insult to the people who have chosen us to represent their interests in the D&aacute;il. I appeal to the Government, even at this stage, to have some semblance of dignity and to honour the functions of the House. It should present a proposal to be considered over a longer period so we can have <Col N="1140"/>the debate we need on this matter. Then the decision eventually made by the people will be the proper one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On 25 January last the Government presented its schedule of legislation for the spring session, which ends today. Only six of the Bills highlighted on that list have been addressed since and this proposal was not one of them. Other legislation is being parachuted in, which contributes to the backlog of important legislation which the House should deal with.</P>
    <P>We are not opposed to the idea of coming back the week after next, nor, I suspect, are other Opposition Members. We have long argued that there should be longer sittings, which would give greater opportunities to move legislation forward. There would be better participation and an end to guillotines. We have put down amendments to the Order of Business which seek critical changes to the proposition read out by the Minister of Defence.</P>
    <P>We seek a change in paragraph (2)(i), to delete &ldquo;6.30 p.m.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10.30 p.m.&rdquo; and in paragraph (2)(ii), we seek to delete &ldquo;no&rdquo; &mdash; in other words, there should be an Order of Business. We seek to delete paragraph (2)(iii) and substitute the following: &ldquo;(iii) there shall be Leaders&rsquo; Questions pursuant to Standing Order 26A on Wednesday, 21 April and Thursday, 22 April, 2004.&rdquo; We seek to delete paragraph (2)(iv), and substitute the following: &ldquo;(iv) oral and written questions shall be taken at 2.30 p.m. each day for one hour and fifteen minutes&rdquo;. We seek to delete paragraph (2)(v), and substitute the following: &ldquo;(v) Private Members&rsquo; business shall be taken at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 April, 2004, for 90 minutes to adjourn until 7 p.m. on Thursday, 22 April, 2004, to conclude at 8.30 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We seek to delete paragraph (2)(viii), which indicates that divisions will be postponed until the following week. That proposal is an absolute nonsense and is a recipe for people not attending the House. It creates an illusion that the House is sitting and seriously addressing issues, when the reality is that if a vote does not have to be taken, many Members, particularly Government Deputies, will simply not be here. There will no whip on them and no onus on them to be here. Other Bills need to be addressed as a matter of priority and while we do not claim a monopoly of wisdom on which should be dealt with, we commend the Equality Bill 2004 as legislation which could be addressed in those two days. This so-called Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill is an absolute disgrace and, on my first reading of its wording today, it is even worse than what I expected from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Government Members should view a future based on this proposition with shame. Shame on both parties in the coalition.</P>
    <P>I formally move the amendment to the proposed Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

<Col N="1141"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to move the amendment now. As the Deputy knows we are discussing the proposal on how to deal with the measures. We are not discussing the motion at this stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we take this without debate when there is an amendment before the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what we are discussing. It is not appropriate to move the amendment now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the precedent for that decision? Is the Chair going to make a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair may rule, but on what precedent?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy reads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very rare that an amendment is presented in formal, tabled form before the House. I see no precedent for this in my years here. To what precedent is the Chair referring? There is a formal amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy goes back to 1992 he will find precedents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The procedure which applies to best practice in such matters is that the amendment is taken first. I urge the Chair to adhere to that practice and to put the amendment first. That would be adhering to correct procedure and Members would have the opportunity to exercise their decision-making based on choice. There is an option.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is following the correct procedure. There are precedents. The Chair has ruled.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Chair ignore an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should show some respect for the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is respect for the Chair but there is a flip side to that, respect for the Deputy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to come to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle he will get all the explanations he wants. I have already told him to read the debates from 1992 and he will get an explanation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order &mdash; at least I think it is a point of order, I know the Chair will <Col N="1142"/>guide me &mdash; can we have an explanation for the fact that no written questions are being dealt with today?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order. That matter was dealt with in the House yesterday.</P>

	<P>It is interesting to hear from the Deputies who like to keep the dignity of this House and lecture us about it and the way they are contributing. I would inform Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that 12 Bills have been published, nine of which are from the A list; one Bill has been approved by the Government and is awaiting publication; ten are expected before the next session and five will not be ready until after the beginning of the next session. The Deputy talked about the schedule prepared in January. That schedule did not include any D&aacute;il sessions on 21 or 22 April. The House was going to be in recess.

	<P>I strongly object to the Bill. The text presented to us in the Schedule by <Col N="1146"/>the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; I question the title &mdash; clearly indicates an intent far beyond what would have been expected.

    <Decision>Question declared carried.</Decision>
   </Vote>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business, in view of the disorder that occurred yesterday during the course of Leaders&rsquo; Questions, I am taking the opportunity to clarify the position. The Leaders&rsquo; Questions facility provided for under Standing Order 26A is confined to leaders of a party or designated leader of a representative group in which no other Member has any standing. The Chair has ruled consistently on that basis, namely that no other Member may intervene even on a point of order. Moreover, the Chair does not have the authority to recognise a Member other than a leader during Leaders&rsquo; Questions unless Standing Orders are changed to that effect.</P>
    <P>Members will appreciate that in order for the Leaders&rsquo; Questions procedure to be effective as intended by the D&aacute;il in introducing this facility in 2001, both the leader asking the question and the Taoiseach or member of the Government replying should be allowed to do so without any interruption whatsoever. It is in the leader&rsquo;s own interest that this should be observed at all times. The Chair was endeavouring to protect leaders&rsquo; rights yesterday. I ask for co-operation of Members to ensure that the Leaders&rsquo; Questions procedure as laid down by this House in Standing Orders is adhered to and that it reflects well on the proceedings of the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Chair&rsquo;s ruling. The Chair is wrong. The Chair has made it up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is not wrong. If the Deputy reads the salient rules of the House he will see that there are precedents. I refer the Deputy to just one ruling by my predecessor on 14 February 2002.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I read them. The Chair is making up new ones and adding them in. That was a bad day and a bad decision. That does not make a precedent. It is only chit-chat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Kenny to contribute without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1148"/>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste indicated that she informed the House on 5 February of the necessity not to bring in primary legislation on this matter. In her reply to my question she stated she had spoken before a relevant Supreme Court case. That was not the situation, as she addressed the House on 5 February and the Supreme Court case was held on 27 January. I invite the T&aacute;naiste to correct the record of the House.</P>
    <P>In respect of the matter that has been voted on this morning, my understanding is that in 1998 the Government was given particular advice by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and presumably by the then Attorney General, that a different situation could have been arrived at in terms of citizenship when the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated. It may well be that if the Government had accepted the advice of the Department and whatever other legal advice it had, this divisive referendum might not now be necessary.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Defence, who is standing in for the Taoiseach, if that evidence, advice or information, will be made available to Opposition parties to help us in the preparation for discussion and to help us reach a conclusion on this matter. There had been no meaningful discussion with us on the matter until yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the respective spokespersons yesterday. He gave them a significant briefing and an undertaking to have the widest possible consultation and deliberations on both proposals.</P>

	<P>I remind the Minister that the Bill is dated Tuesday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I will contact the Deputy as to whether the particular aspect of the matter which <Col N="1149"/>he has raised can be included in that debate. I will make inquiries for the Deputy.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister propose we have consultations when the matter has been decided? I am at a complete loss to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the House will pay tribute to Maureen Potter later. He is her true successor, having introduced a motion earlier which will require that any vote on taking Second Stage of the Bill to be taken a week after Second Stage has been disposed of. He then informs Deputy Kenny that there will be wide consultation after the event.</P>
    <P>Has the Government had discussions with the Northern Ireland parties about the implications of this unilateral change to the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>The Minister should answer the question.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>The House is at the beginning of discussing the matter and will be afforded the fullest possible opportunity to do so. The contents of the implementing Bill were placed before the respective party spokespersons yesterday when it was also indicated that there would be the fullest consultation on them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s standing has increased this morning because it was evident that the Taoiseach missed him yesterday. Will the Minister give a straightforward answer to the question as to whether there have been discussions with the parties in Northern Ireland?</P>

	<P>It is a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; question.</P>

	<P>The matter can be discussed when the legislation comes before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not answered the question. What does he have to hide?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not know the answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill, as published, envisages changing the Constitution and having citizenship subsequently defined by legislation. Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish such legislation in advance of a debate in the House and a referendum to be put before the people? If not, it is asking Opposition Members and the electorate to buy a pig in a poke as regards how citizenship will be defined.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle for his advice on how the House can debate the issue of decentralisation. Proposals on decentralisation were made in the budget and the implementation group has produced its report but the D&aacute;il has not had an opportunity to scrutinise any of the proposals. Does the implementation report have the status of a White Paper, which can be debated in the House and on which Deputies may ask questions? A stonewalling approach is being taken to scrutiny of the issue. This will be necessary, however, as decentralisation marks an important change to the manner in which the State is run. The Oireachtas deserves to have a proper forum to scrutinise the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The report does not have the status of a White Paper. It is a matter for the Whips to decide when it can be debated if a motion is tabled in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle yesterday asked me to be brief in addressing a matter I have been pursuing for several weeks. I am withdrawing my request to the Government to explain the reason it is not publishing the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Bill 1967, as amended in 1976. I have spent six weeks trying to obtain information I was promised in the House by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Defence and another Minister. It is a great insult to a spokesperson on foreign affairs that an undertaking given in the House at the beginning of business in response to a query is not acted on. Not only is it unco-operative, it is deeply insulting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I also asked about the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Bill. I am not in the habit of being disorderly but I have been waiting 41 days for a reply to the question which gave rise to my frustration yesterday. It is not right that Deputy Michael D. Higgins or I should be treated in this way. Even Noah&rsquo;s Ark only had bad weather for 40 days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs indicated yesterday afternoon that it would make direct contact with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1152"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want direct contact, as I stated yesterday. I want an answer in writing, as promised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that the legislation that will give the outworking to the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill will be published later today. Is that correct?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads will be published today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate when the legislation will come before the House, because this Bill may be the first of many now that the issue of citizenship is to be removed from the Constitution and placed in the hands of legislators? When will Deputies have sight of the final text or draft of the Bill? On the issue of consultation, the Minister referred to the questionable briefing opportunity provided at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. What other consultation has the Government engaged in with outside concerns, apart from elected representatives.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked a question on the legislation to which I expect an answer. The Good Friday Agreement is critical and it is incorrect to suggest that Article 2 is not in any way affected by the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on the Order of the Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, there are implications and I need and demand to know what level of consultation took place. The absence of an answer to that question is indicative of the truth, namely, that there has been none. The Government has taken upon itself the notion that it has a monopoly on the wisdom as to how&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer the question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I was one of the spokespersons invited to meet the Minister on the issue. He did not produce implementing or draft legislation or heads of a Bill at the meeting but four bullets amounting to 12 lines. He was quite vague as to when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is relevant to the issue under discussion, given that we will discuss the <Col N="1153"/>main issue the week after next. The constitutional referendum refers specifically to the implementing legislation. This legislation must be available to us before we have the debate. Implementing legislation was produced in parallel with the divorce and abortion referendums. Why, in this case, are the legislation and referendum not being published in parallel?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate a precise time, not only for the publication of the heads of the Bill, which are no real indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Costello has made his point and should resume his seat. He is out of order and he knows that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultations will take place on the draft implementing Bill. It is not the practice to debate that fully until the passage of a referendum. I understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that this can be dealt with afterwards is ridiculous.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste gave an undertaking to this House that both Bills would be published simultaneously. The Minister, Deputy Smith, seems to be saying we will get around to the implementation legislation at a later date. That worsens the already farcical system and abuse of process engaged in so far. Is that still the commitment of the Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. He must allow the Minister to respond.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had discussions with the respective spokespersons where he outlined the proposed content of the draft implementing Bill and gave them copies of the summary document attached to it. He indicated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to full debate on the Bill when it formally comes before the Oireachtas, after the passage of the relevant proposal, and its willingness to consider reasonable suggestions for amendments to these proposals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a denial of the position expressed by the T&aacute;naiste when she said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we come in here on the Wednesday after Easter to debate this if it cannot be clarified now?</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1154"/>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill and a detailed explanatory document on the referendum proposal containing the draft of the text of the implementing Bill will be circulated to Deputies today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Bill be published? The Deputy should answer the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last 48 hours I have had much correspondence about that matter. The implementing legislation will have an impact on a range of areas. Will it include references to non-immigration policy, worker visas and green cards, all of which will be affected if the legislation is implemented? Why is the Government doing this when the ground has not been prepared for a rational and constructive discussion on the issue?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow one brief contribution from each party and then we will finish on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We have now established that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, does not know if the Government has had discussions with the parties in Northern Ireland on the implications for the Belfast Agreement. There has been a reversal of the undertaking given in this House by the T&aacute;naiste that both Bills would be published simultaneously so that we might know exactly what we were talking about. The principles set down by the Lenihan committee on how we should go about amending our Constitution have been grossly abused. The Bill is being taken in the minimum time prescribed by law, as if it were a matter of emergency. The Minister now tells the House, without precedent, that the Government has done a 180-degree turn and has published the text of the amendment without supplying the House with the implementing legislation. Deputy Costello was given one sheet of paper with four bullet points yesterday. It is unacceptable and disgraceful that we in this Parliament should be asked to debate this Bill as an emergency measure when we have not seen the full context of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1155"/>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a further insult to the House. Despite my earlier question, we are still uncertain whether there will be a Bill. Going on the precedent that has existed for other constitutional referenda, where the enabling legislation was published at the same time as the wording for the referendum, we have a Government that is producing proposals that are not thought out and are clearly being rushed. The proposal that the House should meet on 21 and 22 April to discuss a policy that the Government does not realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must make a brief comment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being brief. This is only my second contribution this morning. Something has to be said to make the Government realise that it is doing a great disservice to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Smith&rsquo;s responses contradict answers already given by the T&aacute;naiste. I asked him to indicate what consultation has taken place. There is an obligation to consult the Human Rights Commission. The Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill represents a challenge to the human rights of Irish-born children. The human rights of Irish-born children are apart from their citizenship rights. When will we see this legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see the Deputy&rsquo;s concern for the human rights of Irish citizens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, question mark, will give us the answer this morning. His ministerial colleague has only added confusion and anger. We need the two simultaneously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Let there be no mistake that the implications of this measure under the Good Friday Agreement are very serious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the House agrees, will the Ceann Comhairle invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement to clarify this important issue? I do not think the Minister for Defence understands the issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it very clear that the content of the Government&rsquo;s implementing legislation will be published in the near future so this House, when it is considering the amendment to the Constitution Bill, will know the substance of the Government&rsquo;s proposals on the implementing legislation which will give effect to that amendment.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Defence referred to the wider consultations and discussions on the implementing legislation.

	<P>On a point of order, it is important to be fair to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He may not be aware of it, but the question was not answered here before he arrived.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to express the deepest sympathy of the House and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the passing of a much loved actor supreme, Maureen Potter. Though a quintessential Dub, she touched the <Col N="1160"/>lives of generations of Irish people and others in every corner of the country. There is nothing more precious than being able to make people laugh, and Maureen Potter did so during many dreary times and good times by her wonderful acting in the theatre, and people had the opportunity to hear her on radio and see her on television. Our sympathies to her husband, Jack, and to her two sons, Hugh and John. Maureen <Col N="1161"/>Potter has made an indelible mark on the lives of so many people who are extremely grateful to her. We all mourn her loss.</P>

	<P>I join the Minister for Defence in expressing the nation&rsquo;s sorrow at the passing of Maureen Potter. She was an institution in Ireland as someone who was a supremo in theatre, pantomime and humour generally. She touched the lives of millions of Irish people and brought a smile to their faces through good times and bad times. As a child, I always thought &mdash; I know her family will forgive me &mdash; she also had a child called &ldquo;Christy&rdquo;, because he was a central part of the radio programmes I used to listen to prior to television. In her Dublin way, she epitomised all that is good about Irish humour and Irish nature. The nation will be poorer for her passing. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.</P>
    <P>I would also like to express my sympathy to the family of Enda Colleran who died last night. He captained two winning All Ireland Galway teams, was the scourge of Mayo in the 1960s and a wonderful person to know. He epitomised all that is best in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.</P><?oasys _cl10.5-?>

	<P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of the Minister for Defence and Deputy Kenny on the passing of Maureen Potter. I suppose to some extent we are showing our age; I am a member of the Duran Duran generation. It is true that Maureen Potter brought pleasure to hundreds of thousands of Irish people in a very long and distinguished career on the stage and in the media. She was a very active member of Actors Equity. She was known to be very kind to young people coming up in the business. In many ways it is an end of an era.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Kenny in expressing shock at the news we heard this morning about someone I knew very well, Enda Colleran, who apparently passed away in his sleep at the early age of 63. He will be forever immortalised as the two times captain of the Galway team of 1964-66 that won three All Ireland championships in a row. To his family I offer the condolences of the Labour Party.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the expressions of sympathy to the bereaved family and friends of Maureen Potter and the tributes to her tremendous contribution to Irish theatre over many decades. She was a great Irish entertainer who preferred to live and work here than to seek the fame she would undoubtedly have gained had she gone to England or America. She gave the gift of laughter to Irish children in the theatre and on the radio. I remember from my own childhood Sunday dinner entertainment on RTE radio and my first exposure to the Dublin accent. Years later I would meet my elected colleague on Dublin City Council and try to imitate how Maureen Potter would say &ldquo;Christy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>She was one of the greatest personalities in the history of Irish theatre and entertainment. One of her favourite closing lines in her shows in the <Col N="1162"/>Gaiety Theatre was, &ldquo;If you liked the show, tell your friends and if you did not, save your breath to cool your porridge.&rdquo; Those words are good advice to many of us in the House and after this morning&rsquo;s exchange with the Minister, we will save our breath to cool our porridge.

	<P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the families of Enda Colleran and Maureen Potter.</P>
    <P>It was with great sadness that I learned of the death yesterday of Maureen Potter in her home in Clontarf in my constituency of Dublin North-Central. Maureen was a very special person to many Dubliners and she entertained us over many years in a special way, giving us many hours of laughter through her professional work. As a relatively young person, I have fond memories of family outings to one of the big events of the year, a day in the theatre with Maureen Potter. She is truly a legend in Ireland&rsquo;s theatrical heritage and her legacy will live on and be celebrated for many years to come. My thoughts and prayers are with her husband Jack, her sons Hughie and John, her stage colleagues and her many, many friends.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I also express my sympathy to the family of the late, great Maureen Potter. She was a constituent of mine and I join the Minister of State in extending my condolences to her family. Many of us were deeply saddened to hear of her death because of her background in the entertainment world and the joy she brought to many people.</P>
    <P>Maureen was born in Fairview in 1925. She was a great northsider and even though she had a broader audience, north of the Liffey people were very proud of her, particularly in Fairview and Marino. She was a great artist and entertainer with a warm heart and Jack, Hugh and John must be very upset at this time.</P>
    <P>There are many fond memories of Maureen. She was a great supporter of those with disabilities and a strong advocate of those with intellectual disabilities. Anyone who saw Maureen interacting with people with intellectual disabilities would see she had no baggage and that they understood her great warmth. She was a supporter of animal rights and had a particular gr&aacute; for the elderly. I was involved in a project for the elderly in Marino and we were stuck for a famous entertainer to open it. I rang Maureen and she had no problem doing it and refused all offers of money for the gig. These are the sides to Maureen Potter that people might have missed.</P>
    <P>As a Galway man living in Dublin, I am absolutely shocked by the death of Enda Colleran, a fantastic footballer, a former captain of Galway, a great player and a great leader on the field. To Enda&rsquo;s family I extend my deepest sympathies, as I do to Jack, John and Hugh on the death of Maureen Potter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the words of sympathy to the Potter family on <Col N="1163"/>Maureen&rsquo;s death. She entertained the nation with good, clean fun for many years.</P>
    <P>I also express my sympathy to the wife and family of Enda Colleran who passed away early this morning. Enda captained Galway to All-Ireland victory in 1965 and 1966 as part of the team that won three All Ireland championships in a row. Enda led by example on and off the field and not only will his sporting prowess be missed but his wit and good humour as well. I offer his wife Anne and his family my condolences.</P>

	<P>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il and on my own behalf, I extend sympathies to the Colleran family on the sad and untimely death of Enda Colleran, a teacher, a footballer and a great football analyst on television. I had the honour of knowing Enda Colleran very well, I was a pupil in St. Enda&rsquo;s College, Galway, when he came in as a young teacher. He was held in the highest regard by everyone, particularly by the students. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal d&iacute;lis.</P>

   <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s priorities this week and in the weeks to come are an abuse of the D&aacute;il, democracy and the people. This arrogant Government is unilaterally unravelling the Good Friday Agreement by rushing through legislation to allow for a change in the Constitution without discussing it with the Northern Ireland parties, which are signatories of the Agreement, or in any proper way with the parties in this House. It will be rushed through unnecessarily so that it can be put to the people electronically in the format we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Electronic voting is of major concern to the people but it is being rushed through in a way that ignores the real concerns of the Opposition. Deputy John Bruton referred to the consensus that normally exists on these matters and that in response there is good will. People feel that the results of our work enjoy the support of the State and the parties in the D&aacute;il. That has not happened in this case.</P>
    <P>If electronic voting were to produce good results which were of paramount importance and would justify rushing this Bill through, we might support it in the House today. However, I cannot see any opportunities in the Bill to improve the system. Electronic voting might have produced an improvement in access, accuracy and trust, but the Government is falling down on all those points. If it had taken its time and responded to concerns raised by the Opposition and members <Col N="1164"/>of the public, about which I have received<?oasys _jy?>e-mails, the Government could have done better.</P>
    <P>On the issue of access, I refer particularly to people who are blind or partially-sighted, in respect of whom possibilities are not to be grasped. We have seen information by experts about how the system could have been made more accurate through random selection, but the new system will not be any better than that which we already have. Moreover, it will be worse in that no second or third subsequent counts will be possible to ascertain different random results. In the context of trust, the question of a voter-verified audit trail has been raised from the beginning of this debate and was addressed in detail by the Labour Party in a document before the legislation was published in September 2003, but these concerns have not been responded to. Therefore, in the three important areas in which we could have seen improvements in the system in order that the will of the people was more accurately implemented, we have seen none.</P>
    <P>We are gaining nothing and losing a great deal. As many Deputies have said, we are losing the ritual of the count and manual voting by which means voters can see that their votes have been recorded accurately. In losing that ritual, we are losing much of the excitement, fun and sport of elections, which is important because it is one of the factors that makes people interested in politics. We have seen a significant increase in the number of people turned off politics, especially young people. People could follow the count over a few days on radio and television. They could listen to results on local radio stations on which they are reported box by box over time. They can even bet on the outcome of elections, and I had the honour of winning money for people in the bookies on an election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They will win again because the Government will lose.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>People bet on events about which they get worked up. I cannot see people getting worked up about the electronic system which is to be introduced over a very short period. We will not have the weekend of television coverage which is exciting for people. We will lose much of the interest in elections as well as many of the educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hoctor is listening to me. She has experience of teaching and, like me, is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science. Young people learn a great deal from the voting process, especially the proportional representation system which we are fortunate to have in Ireland. When I visit schools to speak to transition year students studying these matters, one has a picture of the transfer of votes and one can explain it by recalling how one has seen it happening where bundles are added to other bundles. That will no longer be the case because we will not have that visual impression of what happens anymore.</P>
    <P>At a relatively young age, I became involved in counts and saw other young people getting involved which brought them into the political <Col N="1165"/>system. The counts also give parties the opportunity to work together, interact, bring information to whoever has the computer at the count centre and co-operate by shouting back the tally and so on. We will lose all that and, as a result, will lose much of the interest we have in politics. Deputy John Bruton, who spoke before me last night, referred to the acceptance of the result because of the ritual and the different steps within it. He referred to it being similar to a funeral in that it has a &ldquo;before&rdquo;, an &ldquo;after&rdquo; and a time in between in which one gradually learned the outcome and came to accept it.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that this system is being introduced for the elections on 11 June. A number of issues are to be decided in one day by the voters. In some places, where there is a town or city council as well as a county council, four issues will be decided, including the European elections and the referendum on citizenship. In what order will people vote or can they chose in what order they wish to vote? Some people&rsquo;s interest might flag. If a person&rsquo;s main interest is in his or her county or city council, he or she should have the opportunity to vote for that first. I am not sure if this is provided for. It will be confusing for people who are not used to electronic mechanisms to have to vote on four issues at the same time. It may not be difficult for people when they get into the polling booth but it might deter many people turning out because they will be presented with the new system and are not sure they will be able to understand it.</P>
    <P>Owing to their fears and concerns and despite the information campaigns, many people with the intention of voting will not have done so by the time the polling booths close. This is especially the case for people with literacy problems. Obviously, such people already have difficulties with voting in what one might call the old-fashioned system, although in some ways it is not old-fashioned, but they will be deterred to a greater extent by the new system. Some people I know with literacy difficulties memorise the image of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. There will be photographs this time, which will help. However, to my knowledge, people will also have to press a button which reads &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; to register their vote, something they would not have had to do before. I do not know if there are plans to make that aspect more straightforward for people with literacy problems because it creates another difficulty for them, and this is a cause of concern for me.</P>
    <P>Why are we rushing this legislation through? Why are we spending this valuable Oireachtas time on this issue to have it in place by 11 June when it will already be complicated by the number of different issues people will have to address? We have much urgent legislation with which we have not dealt. For example, I have asked for the House to take Report Stage of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill since it finished Committee Stage in early February. The Select Committee on Education and Science returned in January during the recess to commence Committee Stage. We did not get through all of it during the recess, continued it in <Col N="1166"/>the House and returned to finish it at the beginning of this session. However, the Bill has still not been introduced on Report Stage. When I raised the issue last week, I was told the Bill under discussion was getting priority over that Bill for this week. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill is of crucial importance to young people in school who have special learning needs but it has been put on the back burner while we deal with this Bill. In addition, the disability Bill which is linked in to the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill and is supposed to have been a Government priority for a long time is also affected by this delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore, the Labour Party spokesperson on this area who has eloquently addressed our concerns about this Bill, has frequently raised a number of Bills under the environment portfolio which are urgent, specifically the Residential Tenancies Bill. However, this Bill and others on the agenda of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have been put on the back burner because this Bill has been given priority. I object to this Bill on those grounds too. We need to prioritise legislation. We have a great deal of business to deal with in this House and some issues are more important than others.</P>
    <P>Installing the electronic voting system before June, leaving insufficient time to consider all the questions raised, is not a priority. I would put it far down the priority list. The issue could have been addressed in the autumn, the reservations dealt with and the system improved and made more inclusive. Instead, the measure is being rushed through.</P>
    <P>Last night, the interesting question of whether the technology will have to be updated at a later date was raised. I believe it will, if the system is to be made accessible. Will that entail more substantial costs as time goes on? Should we not have examined the issue of accessibility and waited until suitable technology became available? I am not a technocrat and I do not know if this will happen. However, a previous speaker has said that the technology is being updated on a frequent basis. We should have waited for that.</P>
    <P>The commission was established only because Opposition Deputies demanded it. It has been told it can do whatever it likes so long as it complies with the Government&rsquo;s plans. There is not enough time or opportunity for the commission to do anything else. I have respect for the members of the commission but I cannot see how they can do more than rubber-stamp what the Government is planning to do.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, spoke in detail about the Opposition&rsquo;s constitutional concerns. The legislation allows the Minister to make regulations regarding democracy and the voting system which are not in the primary legislation. This is a real concern. The constitutionality of the legislation may well be challenged in the later stages of the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of the Bill may also be challenged on the issue of access. The present system does not have the capacity to address the <Col N="1167"/>concerns of the visually impaired. They have no choice but to use the assistance of a sighted person in casting their vote. The electronic system has the capacity to provide for people who are visually impaired. I have been told by someone who is visually impaired that it would cost only &euro;2.50 to provide the voice activation and headphones necessary to facilitate a blind voter casting his or her vote without assistance. That is a small price to pay.</P>
    <P>In the 2002 census of population 78,000 people declared themselves to be either visually or hearing impaired. As there are slightly more people visually impaired than hearing impaired, this means there are approximately 40,000 visually impaired people in the country. Most of these are in the older age groups. This sizeable sector of the population could have been accommodated if a small effort had been made. I understand that cases will be taken to the Equality Authority on this ground. Interested parties are also checking the constitutionality of this aspect of the legislation. This new system should be equally available to all our citizens because that is possible.</P>
    <P>In answer to a parliamentary question submitted by my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, in February last the Minister stated: &ldquo;The system suppliers have undertaken initial work on developing a prototype facility to allow visually impaired voters to use the machine unaided and the Department will examine their proposals carefully when they have been received.&rdquo; I subsequently pursued the matter but there has been no indication that this will be done. I would welcome the provision of such a facility. It would solve one of my problems.</P>
    <P>The option of minimising the random nature of the redistribution of surplus votes was available but was not availed of. The random selection used when distributing a surplus in the Irish system presents a particular challenge. Where two counts are carried out, one electronic and one manual, using two different random selections the result of the counts may well be different. Using the existing software, the randomisation of the count could be repeated many times. The machine itself could minimise the random nature of the distribution of surpluses. This is not being done. The legislation forbids a second count which might give a different random result. I can see why that would be. It was possible to address the inaccuracies of the present system. However, the new system is no better than the old one in this regard.</P>
    <P>The issue of trust and the provision of a voter-verified audit trail has been debated in this House and in the media. This could have been done. The people would have had greater trust in the system if they had been provided with a docket which showed them how they had cast their vote, without identifying them. We expect this from our banks. I would not trust my bank if it did not provide me with written verification of a transaction. Why should be expect the public to trust these machines? A previous speaker stated that all software is subject to error and <Col N="1168"/>malfunction. Why should this system be different? The technical information is available to show that a paper trail is possible.</P>
    <P>The new system will only do what the present one can do. It will not be better. We will lose the exciting ritual attached to elections. We are rushing this measure through and not providing sufficient time to address the concerns of Members of the Oireachtas, the media and the voters. The voters are more important than those of us who stand up and express opinions. Many people who have remained silent during this controversy will remain at home on 11 June because of their concerns about this system.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to technology. I will support the new system if it can be proved to be better in the future, but not on 11 June.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Ms Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och d&iacute;ot, a Chathaoirligh, as ucht seans a fh&aacute;il labhairt os comhair an T&iacute; ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo. I am delighted to have this brief opportunity to express my opinions and to welcome the electronic voting system. Although the Government is being accused of rushing the Bill through the D&aacute;il, those of us who were elected to local authorities in 1999 were clearly told that would be the last local election to use a paper count. This measure has been in preparation for more than four years and it is to be welcomed. The new system will bring speed, efficiency and accuracy. While the present system is good, it will be improved by the new electronic mechanism which will be in place nationwide on 11 June.</P>
    <P>In the general election of May 2002, the votes of more than 20,000 voters were not accepted during the count. While 95% of voters complete their ballot papers with the best of intent some, due to inaccuracy or some distraction, do not state their preference clearly and their votes are questioned by the returning officer and rejected. Electronic voting will provide greater accuracy for the voter. While voters may change their minds before finally casting their vote, it will be accurately recorded. That must be welcomed. We are elected to represent the interests of people who do and do not vote. I hope the accuracy of the electronic system will make it more attractive to voters.</P>
    <P>The Nedap-Powervote system has been accepted as the blueprint to follow. It has been successfully used in Holland for more than ten years. The French Government has accepted the same system for its municipal elections and it is also used in Germany. We will be well able to use the electronic system on 11 June.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that there are many constituencies and that the total number of voters who used the system at the last election was 400,000. The people in this House were successfully elected by people who used the electronic system. Any error which may have occurred at that election can be rectified. It was the launching pad for the electronic system to be used nationwide. The Department&rsquo;s customer survey in the constituencies which were involved at the last election proved that 87% of voters were happy with the system. That is a significant <Col N="1169"/>figure which gives the green light to the system and which assures us of its accuracy and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The current system has been successful. As Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said, the fun of election day was memorable for most people for the right reasons. As regards the accuracy and confidentiality of the current system, we know that could be breached if we did not have trust in the polling clerks and presiding officers. If the presiding officer or polling clerk memorised the number on the ballot paper of a person who cast his or her vote, for example, he or she would know for whom that person had voted when counting the papers. I am not saying that happened under the manual system, but they were in the privileged position of being able to do that if they so wished. At least the electronic system means the person will get time to reflect on his or her vote and then to press the red button. It will then be randomly turned within the system so that it cannot be traced, as is the case at present under the paper system. I welcome the confidentiality of the ballot which will be more secret under this system.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are well informed. I do not know if the roadshow travelled around the country extensively. I had the opportunity at one of our local county council meetings to study the machine and I was impressed with it. I understand that people who had the opportunity to use it throughout the country were happy with it. Elderly people have welcomed it. Their fears were allayed when they saw the machine and realised the photographs of the candidates would be displayed. That means the system is user-friendly. I am sure people will be able to vote on four different ballot papers on the same day for county councils, town councils, etc. It will be great to see all the candidates and ballot papers displayed on the screen.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that the roadshow continues around the country. People&rsquo;s greatest fear is of the unknown. If they become familiar with the system before election day, they will not have any fears. I welcome the new voting system and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to briefly address the House. I support the Minister and the Bill. We use electronic voting in Leinster House all the time now. It has always been accurate and we have not questioned it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies who took part in this wide-ranging debate on the Bill and particularly my two Ministers of State who have given an inordinate amount of time to be in the House for the debate.</P>
    <P>I observed a number of patterns running through the Opposition&rsquo;s contributions. The first is what appears to be negativity towards making improvements in our electoral procedures. Does the Opposition not want to improve our electoral procedures? It wants to use modern technology in this House and elsewhere, but it does not want the public to use it. The public is way ahead of us in this matter and, as was demonstrated at the pilot programmes, more than 90% approved the <Col N="1170"/>use of the voting machines. The public will not have any problems with the use of the voting machines next June.</P>
    <P>Another point I observed was the single-mindedness of the references by the Opposition to the US. One would think we were discussing the US election procedures. I noted that some contributions read like some of the e-mails I and other Members of the House received from the US. The Opposition frequently say, quite incorrectly, that some Members on this side of the House prefer the Boston to the Berlin model. Having listened to many of the Opposition&rsquo;s contributions, it appears it does not know that there are many countries, other than the US, which use electronic voting successfully.</P>
    <P>The deputy leader of the Labour Party spoke about how she discussed electronic voting with a professor in the US to get his views. However, she did not say whether she discussed the differences between the systems used in the US and the system proposed for us here, which would be more pertinent. I understand her party is a member of the second largest group in the European Parliament. Why did she not ask her colleague who is a member of the Parliament to consult with his colleagues from the Netherlands, Germany and now France, some of whom were elected in the past using the system which will be used here and who will be elected again on that system in June. Is there any doubt or illegality attaching to their election? I do not think so.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Florida?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Opposition concentrate solely on the US experience? Why does it not ask our EU neighbours who used the Nedap system for their views? Why does it not look at India or Brazil where millions of voters use electronic voting and counting? Why can we with only 3 million voters not use the system when such diverse countries ranging from the developed countries of Europe to the less-developed countries of India and Brazil use electronic voting and counting?</P>
    <P>Another thread running through the debate was the lack of trust in technology. Much of that probably comes from the e-mails the Opposition received from people, many of whom claim to be IT experts. These people do not have a problem using IT, but they do not want other people to use it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan should allow the Minister to reply.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
<Col N="1171"/>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Opposition Deputies keep referring to the experts. Have they stopped for one minute to ask these people where their expertise comes from, especially in electoral matters? We can all claim to be experts, but the Opposition should be more circumspect in believing everything it hears or receives in<?oasys _jy?>e-mails.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister rubbishes experts if they do not agree with him. He only accepts them if they agree with him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I arranged for people who worked with technology in the electoral area for decades to address the joint committee, but little, if any, heed was given to their evidence by the Opposition. Instead it chose to dwell on evidence given by opponents to the system, some of whom have no experience of elections and little proven expertise in IT.</P>
    <P>Another piece of misinformation aired again during the debate is that the Government is trying to change the electoral system. That is utterly untrue as the new system provides only a method of voting, recording and vote counting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not run a dual system to prove his case and see if he gets the same result?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The same PRSTV system still applies in full. Changes to the count rules, not the electoral system, will be considered after June 2004.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some of the specific points raised. Before addressing them, I must state that I and the Department have considered all reports and observations made to us and we have spent a considerable amount of time and resources in responding to them.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>One would think the so-called experts know everything, but there are clearly established systems in operation, not all in the US, which rebut their arguments. We have responded extensively. In the Oireachtas, both Houses and the joint committee have spent almost 20 hours discussing this topic since last November. Not surprisingly, the debate is generally repetitive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>And inconclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore asked why we are spending time on the Bill instead of on other legislation. Perhaps he should answer that himself. Despite spending approximately 20 hours debating this topic since November, the Opposition would like to have more time.</P>

	<P>A total of &euro;60 million down the drain.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill derives mostly from the judgment in the courts about ministerial orders. We would argue about this matter but the Deputies will know that when Members of the Opposition were in Government they used the same orders, especially in the electoral area. They did not appear to have any trouble with their use. Section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 was drafted having regard to the Supreme Court judgment in the Cityview Press case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s colleagues on the backbenches should hear the Minister&rsquo;s speech.</P>

  <P Italics="Y">Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</P>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from a few Deputies, all the parties are in favour of electronic voting. One would scarcely believe that fact from all the misinformation and doubts created by the Opposition in recent months.</P>
    <P>The issue of trust arose many times in the debate. If there is a lack of trust, it arises from the Opposition&rsquo;s stance and pronouncements in the media. It should be clear from this debate that all the Opposition parties are in favour of electronic voting. However, it is a little dubious to profess support for electronic voting in the House and then give the impression to the media and the public that they oppose it. I accept there are some matters on which there is concern but these concerns are being met in a reasonable manner. Unfortunately, however, neither the Opposition nor some sections of the media wishes to listen or take on board the responses given or to deal with them in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>The three matters which have been raised most frequently are the facility called the voter verifiable paper audit trail or VVPAT, making the source code available and the testing of the system. I and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, have dealt with these matters on a number of occasions in the House, at the joint committee and in the Seanad. I will deal with them once more in the time available. The VVPAT is a subject which is exercising concern, mostly in the US, over the use of PC based systems. Whether the facility should be provided is the subject of debate. It is not a proven or statutory requirement. There are arguments on both sides but we must live in the real world, not the academic world. In California, where it is proposed that the new equipment purchased in 2005 must have a VVPAT, there are no such machines available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why it should be abandoned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also a court challenge that such a system will disadvantage disabled and other groups. Assisting those groups is one of the main arguments for using electronic voting. Does the Opposition not wish to facilitate people with <Col N="1173"/>physical or visual disabilities? Several Deputies in their contributions sought a facility to enable visually impaired voters to vote independently.</P>
    <P>The only country that was using a VVPAT type system is now discontinuing it. Our European neighbours are not using it. Are they all wrong or are the so-called experts the only people who are correct about this?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody else has our voting system. The Minister did not mention that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Are people credible who have campaigned for the facility and who have admitted on the radio that they have not seen the voting machine? That is their argument against electronic voting. Is Deputy Connolly&rsquo;s argument credible when he admits that he has never seen or used the voting machine? The debate has been marked by statements from people who have never used or seen the voting machine and consequently know little about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>All one sees is a frame.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A major point in the debate was the admission by a leading party spokesperson that the proposed system is not the same as the US system complained of. At least that is some recognition of reality.</P>
    <P>If one compares the various steps in the advocated VVPAT to what the Nedap voting machine does, there is little or no difference. The major argument is that the voter will see an image of his or her vote before pressing the &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; button. This claim shows the lack of information about the proposed system and the invalid comparisons made with a PC based system. In the latter, one votes by touching the screen against the image of a ballot paper and when one finishes one presses another button or prompt. A second image appears so one can confirm it is the same as the original.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sixty million is a great deal to spend on a theory.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Opponents fail to recognise or perhaps do not want to admit that on the Nedap machine the voter sees the ballot paper on the voting machine screen. It is the actual ballot paper, not an image of it.</P>
    <P>Another myth is about verification. The voter can verify on the machine that the preference recorded when pressing the vote for candidate is for that candidate, as the details are displayed on the voting machine display screen. The machine, therefore, permits a voter to verify his or her preference before pressing the &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; button. With regard to printing a ballot paper at the time of voting, this is unnecessary and would create <Col N="1174"/>constitutional and practical difficulties. The Opposition knows that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Suddenly the Constitution comes into focus. I hope the Minister does not believe all that rubbish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What I have learned from this debate is the reason Fine Gael is going through the floor in terms of voter popularity. The party does not have a bull&rsquo;s notion of what is going on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister&rsquo;s former leader was here, he would not stand there telling us that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy does not have a bull&rsquo;s notion. First, if such ballot papers are printed, no matter who stores them a link is created between the voter and the vote. This is not permitted under the Constitution, as the Deputy probably knows but does not want to admit. The practical difficulties with printers are well known and there is no need for me to go into detail about them. The Labour Party report, which was mentioned in the debate, recognised that with our count rules the availability of such printed ballot papers could not be relied upon to give the same result as an electronic count due to the different mix of ballot papers. If the printer broke down or the poll had to be suspended if one ballot paper is missing, the argument for a VVPAT manual check would be negated. The system will produce printed ballot papers if ordered by the courts. There is little difference here and the Opposition is being mischievous in its comments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. We are not the ones spending &euro;60 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The people do not trust the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is like a boy with a new toy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No justified concerns have arisen in the debate. The Opposition recycles the same points raised in the past few months, which seem intended to confuse the electorate, particularly as all the parties opposite agree with electronic voting and counting. There is no point in complaining about lack of trust, as the parties opposite say. They agree with electronic voting and counting in the House and say the opposite outside. It is time to move on and embrace the future. Unfortunately, Fine Gael is rooted in the past.</P>
