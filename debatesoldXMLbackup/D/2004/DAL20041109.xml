      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">In this area we tend to focus on the drugs issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These are statistical questions which refer to Cabinet sub-committees. We do not go into detail on questions on specific subjects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach a question on that issue. In terms of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs, has the Cabinet taken any measures or focused on the social inclusion aspect?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise under these seven questions. If the Deputy has a question, it should be submitted to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The only question I have put to the Taoiseach is whether the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion has discussed social inclusion. I submit, with respect, that this is an entirely reasonable question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>All seven of these questions are purely statistical. Deputies cannot ask questions of the Taoiseach which should properly be addressed to line Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In Question Time for the past month we dealt with precisely the kind of territory in respect of the drugs aspect that the Chair is now ruling out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where we have statistical questions, the Chair has continued to rule out supplementary questions, as have my predecessors. This relates to a Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is getting even worse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that. The purpose of us putting in a question like that is to use it as a <Col N="4"/>peg upon which to hang questions regarding the substance of the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. However, questions that relate to Cabinet business have never been allowed in this House and questions that are more appropriate to the line Minister responsible are not appropriate at this Question Time. The Chair has ruled on this many times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, the Taoiseach is Chairman of this sub-committee. Although I dispute your ruling, with respect, the only question I asked does not impinge on your ruling. I merely asked the Taoiseach whether the Cabinet is focused on the social inclusion aspect of the sub-committee and whether any decisions have been taken in that regard. I find it very difficult, even taking the narrowest view you are taking today on this issue, how you can rule out a question that says, &ldquo;to ask the Taoiseach when the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion last met&rdquo;, and so on. I am merely asking him whether the sub-committee concerned addresses the question of social inclusion separately from the issue of drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will accept that the business of Cabinet is confidential and it is not acceptable to ask supplementary questions about what goes on at a Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I must submit, with great respect, that if you are saying that Cabinet confidentiality inhibits me or any Opposition Deputy asking whether a Cabinet sub-committee designated to deal with social inclusion does in fact do so, then it is time we all went home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Most of the issues in this sub-committee are based around social exclusion and finding means and ways of helping to alleviate the problems that are created in areas where there are difficulties and hardship and where social <Col N="5"/>inclusion means can assist. There is a number of Ministers involved in the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In connection with the area we pursued at the last Question Time, is the Taoiseach concerned, as Chairman of this Cabinet sub-committee, about the incidence of drug misuse and abuse outside Dublin? The Taoiseach may recall that at the time the sub-committee was set up, I was the Minister responsible for its establishment and there was no opiates abuse outside the Dublin area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the Deputy is going outside the scope of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The extent of abuse outside Dublin has trebled since 1998.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is more appropriately addressed to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>All I am asking the Taoiseach is whether, as Chairman of the sub-committee and as Taoiseach, he is concerned that opiates abuse and drug abuse in general&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;outside Dublin is on the increase and whether this is a matter that is the focus of the sub-committee about which I am attempting to ask questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to that question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Over the past year many measures and discussions have taken place in this regard. We considerably extended the programme. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, would be glad to the give the details of that. While hard drugs such as heroin may not be the drugs in question, the efforts, procedures and processes being put in place in the regions are now almost mirroring what is happening in the city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will endeavour to abide by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling. The Taoiseach informed the House on 18 May that the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs had met ten times in the previous 12 months. On the basis that the drugs problem has worsened, as has been widely acknowledged, and that the European Commission&rsquo;s joint report on social inclusion ranks Ireland very low in terms of its success in this area, at least in regard to social inclusion, can the Taoiseach indicate whether there has been an increase in the frequency of the meetings of the sub-committee, or whether it has met as often as ten times in the past 12 months? What is the frequency of its meetings? Given that there is an air of confidentiality surrounding the workings of the sub-committee, to which the Ceann Comhairle referred, does the Taoiseach consider there may be a case for the sub-committee not to be within Cabinet, which would enable <Col N="6"/>us to discuss what it deals with given that the issues concerned are of such critical importance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In all these areas we are dealing with critical issues, particularly in the case of drug abuse. Without going outside the Chair&rsquo;s ruling, I point out that practically all the efforts, resources, commitments, expenditures in respect of this area with which the line Minister is dealing, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, have been proactively moved to the regions. He has plans to deal with specific problem areas. I am sure he would be glad to answers questions on this matter. Practically all our work has been to move the focus to the difficult areas and to link them with a specific plan to deal with these difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not indicate the frequency of the sub-committee&rsquo;s meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are held monthly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The mid-term review of the 2001-08 national drugs strategy is under way. Is the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs involved in this process, or does the Taoiseach, as chairman of that sub-committee, delegate responsibility to somebody to attend the national drugs strategy review? What is the position on that?</P>
        <P>Does the remit of the sub-committee which he chairs extend to dealing with the consequences of driving while under the influence of a substance? Recently there was a horrific case where this happened and which was reported widely in the national newspapers. Does the remit of the sub-committee extend to deal with or make recommendations on the consequences of such behaviour?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. That matter is under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and comes under the laws of that Department.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, the terms of reference of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion are to provide strategic focus in tackling the problems of social exclusion, disadvantage and alienation. The work of the sub-committee encompasses issues ranging from drugs to issues throughout the country. Its agenda ranges across the responsibilities of a large number of Ministers, as guided by the provisions of the programme for Government, Sustaining Progress, the national development plan, the national drugs strategy, to which the Deputy referred, and the national anti-poverty strategy. All the relevant Ministers with responsibility for those areas are involved. Therefore, in reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, the sub-committee monitors and reports on the national drugs strategy.</P>

	<P>While I am aware the Taoiseach will not discuss the details of the discussions of the sub-committee, will he indicate whether the alarming rise in the prevalence of cocaine is being addressed by the sub-committee and advise if it will bring forward proposals in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for a line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach is disposed to answer, his response will be welcome.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm the correct title of the sub-committee on housing, infrastructure and PPP? Sometimes in official notices the housing element of the title is missing. Does this sub-committee have a responsibility in delivering the 10,000 so-called affordable houses promised under the Sustaining Progress agreement? Will the sub-committee address the need to increase the output of social housing to meet the urgent need of the 48,000 household units currently on housing waiting lists throughout the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will be contained in the answer to the next group of questions. The sub-committee deals with the issues referred to in Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>Deputy Gregory has submitted a question to the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention, at a future meeting of this committee, to discuss the recent emergence of the use of crack cocaine in his constituency and in one or two other areas of Dublin? Given the extreme nature of this drug and the huge impact it is likely to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you may ask a supplementary question on the issues covered by Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to deal with this issue? Although there have been only one of two instances of the use of this drug the garda&iacute; have made a number of seizures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These are purely statistical questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle, but maybe the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to have a discussion on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attend meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee? There have been recent differences of opinion between him and the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs. Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform keep abreast of policy on the drugs issue? Given, as Deputy Rabbitte has said, that the use of heroin is spreading in urban areas outside Dublin, is the under-resourcing of Garda drugs units in these areas addressed by the sub-committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s first question is yes. The committee has discussed recent developments in the use of drugs and will continue to do so. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or one of his Ministers for State always attends meetings of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>There are now Garda drugs teams in every areas. They are no longer only in a limited number of areas. These teams are not part of the committee&rsquo;s work, however. They have been extended by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to all regions. There is a Garda drugs task force in each of the regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion examined the submissions made to the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the vast majority of those submissions took a negative view of the performance of the strategy to date? Will he indicate the committee&rsquo;s current thinking on this matter?</P>
        <P>When two Ministers publicly express opposing opinions on a drug treatment process, as happened recently with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who decides the Government position or is that resolved by the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs and social inclusion? It is unfortunate to have two polarised positions abroad.</P>
        <P>Has the sub-committee discussed the fact that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the lack of stability in funding, resources, personnel and the ability to progress projects for the local drugs task force&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. These questions are statistical.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly because of the absence of RAPID funding? Are any steps being taken to ensure the local drugs task force can operate effectively?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the first question, obviously the national drugs strategy is monitored. The Deputy should table a question to the Minister. It is not the case that there is a poor return in that area. An enormous amount has been achieved in this regard. The strategy has been extended beyond the original 13 regions to include many others, the details of which are available. The Cabinet cleared the national drugs strategy, so the stated policy in that regard is Government policy.</P>
        <P>Not alone are resources available for the 13 original regions but resources are also being extended. The capital resources, which include most of the capital building programme, are also being rolled out. The next wave of proposals is currently before the Minister who will provide details when answering questions that have been tabled on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that at the next meeting of this sub-committee, or such a meeting in the near future, he will have discussed the absence of any harm-reduction programmes to deal with this issue outside Dublin? In that context, the health research board has recently made certain startling findings.</P>
        <P>Did I hear the Taoiseach say that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is always in attendance at these meetings? Does the Taoiseach not agree that the issue raised by Deputy Costello goes to the heart of this matter in the minds of many experts, in other words, the question of needle exchange that was the subject of difference between both Ministers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise with both Ministers the issue the Deputy referred to about putting it on the agenda for the next or a future meeting of the sub-committee. I have no difficulty in doing so.</P>
        <P>I stated that either the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or one of his Ministers of State attends those meetings. The issue of policy is outlined in the drugs strategy, which includes the issues referred to by Deputy Rabbitte. They are an accepted part of the programme that works at least as effectively as is possible in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach advise the House whether or not the equal opportunities child care programme falls within the remit of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs? Given the sub-committee&rsquo;s focus on social inclusion, is there such a dimension?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="10"/>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can Question No. 5 also be taken now, a Cheann Comhairle? Will the Taoiseach clarify that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 5 is to ask the Taoiseach when the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and PPPs last met and its planned meetings for 2004. It is purely a statistical question. We will now hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to cover it anyway, a Cheann Comhairle. There have been four meetings of the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs since I last reported to the House. They took place on 9 June, 7 July, 7 September and 13 October. The next meeting will take place tomorrow, and one further meeting is planned before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The discussions at the June meeting focused on major developments relating to infrastructure issues, including progress on key projects and proposals for legislative change. The team also agreed its work programme for the remainder of the year.</P>
        <P>The July meeting centred on a report prepared by a legal issues sub-group, assessing the effectiveness of measures taken in recent times to improve infrastructure and highlighting the remaining obstacles. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also made a presentation on the regional planning guidelines.</P>
        <P>The September meeting focused on progress in addressing the issues raised by the legal issues <Col N="11"/>group report. The team also discussed the infrastructure-related recommendations in the report of the enterprise strategy group. The main theme of the most recent meeting was housing. The topics for discussion at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting of the team are broadband and public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>Overall, the cross-departmental team plays a valuable role in prioritising infrastructure issues to be addressed and, where necessary, proposing possible solutions for consideration by the Cabinet committee specifically and Government generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reaction to the extraordinary revelations made by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing when he told Deputy Gilmore that since enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000, 196,000 houses had been built? However, under Part V of that Act relating to social and affordable housing only 350 houses have been built, 209 affordable units and 106 social units. For all the brouhaha we had about this tremendous social dimension to the legislation, introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the net outcome is 350 social and affordable houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach recall his Government effectively abolishing that measure in favour of the builders and imposing a levy? In terms of the levy on the housing output to which I referred, 80,000 houses were exempted from social and affordable provisions under the 2000 Act and the levy has been paid only in respect of 400 such houses. Is it not fair for any average person or any citizen awaiting housing to conclude that the Government is more concerned about protecting builders than it is about protecting people looking for social and affordable housing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct in saying that the number of house completions in the State have reached a record high. Last year was again a record year with almost 69,000 houses built, almost 15,000 of which were in the Dublin area. House completions for the first six months of this year were again up by 21.5% on last year&rsquo;s figure. Indications for the year is for record completions of up to 80,000 more units, which clearly demonstrates that the measures we had to implement a few years ago to boost supply to deal with the unprecedented demand were successful.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is also correct in pointing to the scale of activity on new houses. While I cannot recall the figure in the past six years, 350,000 houses were built, which is probably close to one third of the houses in the Republic. From 2002 to June of this year approximately 209 affordable units and 106 social units were completed under Part V of the Planning and Development Act. <Col N="12"/>However, more than 1,000 houses are in progress with a further 1,400 proposed, and this figure is increasing all the time.</P>
        <P>When Part V was introduced, people who already had planning permission argued that they should not be subject to its provisions and it created enormous difficulty throughout the country. I cannot recall the number of times I and other Ministers answered questions in the House on this matter proposing that we should allow those with planning permission to proceed and that only new submissions should be subject to Part V. Effectively Part V applies to more recently granted permissions than was originally intended. To help increase supply, which is obviously worthwhile, the Government made the decision to allow people with pre-existing permissions to proceed and Part V applies to any new permissions granted since the effective date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Part V did not apply as intended, otherwise 40,000 houses would have been provided under the social and affordable provisions and that did not happen. Instead of 40,000 houses, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own figures refer to 315 houses. Why has the levy that was to apply to 80,000 houses only been applied to 400 houses to date?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach tell the social partners, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which promoted the issue of affordable housing during the negotiations for Sustaining Progress, that when he said he would build 10,000 additional social and affordable houses, he meant additional to damn all? Did he tell them that no houses were being built under Part V and, as of now, no houses are being built under the commitment to build an additional 10,000? Will the Taoiseach say when the first houses to be built under Sustaining Progress will be ready for occupation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Part V started to take effect at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003 because there was a real fear that the housing supply would cease. Builders and developers played a part in that but they had permissions for these developments and were allowed to finish them. Part V takes effect for new planning permissions &mdash; that was the concession we made to deal with the housing supply. If we had not done that there would not be as many houses being built. It was the only way to deal with this issue, other than in Dublin, where there is a better balance between supply and demand and, although the Dublin area has improved, it is still not in equilibrium.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the people who cannot afford to buy a private home?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of the houses are being bought by first-time buyers. The Deputy saw the recent CSO figures on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="13"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I also saw the number of second houses being bought. What about the people who cannot afford to buy a private home?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are spending almost &euro;2 billion a year on social and affordable housing. Last year 13,000 units were available to people on social housing lists, the highest figure since 1986. This year&rsquo;s figure will be the same or higher. In recent years we have spent well over &euro;5 billion under the national development plan on social housing, an enormous sum. Under a range of social and affordable housing measures, people&rsquo;s housing needs are being met. There are waiting lists but we are building and allocating more houses and we are also helping in terms of voluntary bodies.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about social and affordable housing. We attempted to designate the land, do the planning, build the houses and make them available in a short time but none of the social partners believed they would be available very soon. The State has identified land in Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Meath, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow owned by the State or local authorities for the initiative agreed with the social partners. It was not agreed on the basis that the land would be supplied and the houses would be built. As I stated previously, I would like to see it done quickly because it is a year and a half since we made the arrangements. We had to work through the arrangements with the local authorities, the State and the trade union movement on how that could be done. I wish they moved more quickly on these issues.</P>
        <P>The exact number of units will have to be determined in planning the projects and it will invariably depend on the need to incorporate a mix of housing and other facilities, but the estimated figure is that there will be 8,891 units. That will leave a shortfall of approximately 1,000. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is engaged in discussions with a number of Departments and agencies with a view to securing further lands to meet the shortfall and it is hoped that can be done. The Department of Health and Children and health boards have been asked to identify lands that would have a potential yield to ensure we not only bridge the shortfall but go beyond the expected number. Once the initial planning phase is over and planning permissions for these projects is obtained, perhaps we will be able to move more quickly.</P>
        <P>As I said on the previous occasion this issue was addressed, there have also been discussions with builders about land swaps, an idea the Construction Industry Federation came up with in the context of social partnership. That is being examined. If that happened, it could speed up the construction of these houses because, in many cases, going through the planning process with its associated difficulties and arrangements takes a considerable amount of time. The private sector builders state &mdash; this was a reason for the change <Col N="14"/>to Part V &mdash; that from the time they start the process, as we are doing with these lands, it can take three to four years before they can get through the planning process, the agreements with local authorities about roads, sewerage and drainage works and get the planning permission. That is the point they have made to us and I can see that is the case in some of these areas. Dublin City Council has been very helpful in some of the areas in which it has moved quickly to make progress, as has Fingal County Council. In other areas, the process has been extremely slow but no matter how slow it is, the lands are available and it is a matter of trying to process them as quickly as possible. The State has given the lands and it should supply affordable housing to at least 10,000 people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships, has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to reflect on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report in this regard which concluded that the five schools built by Jarvis could end up costing up to 13% more than if built by the State? The Department of Education and Science believed it would save the State 6%. Is there not a case to look very closely at the road the Government seems determined to go down in depending more on public private partnerships, particularly when such revelations indicate the figures are wrong and have show them to be bad for the Exchequer and for education?</P>
        <P>There are questions hanging over the future of the Cork School of Music and the involvement of Jarvis which, I understand, has had number of contracts axed in the UK on the basis of its status. It is quite a beleaguered company. Is the Government reconsidering public private partnerships and reviewing the situation, particularly in the area of education where they have been found not to be good value and not good for education?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have addressed some of these issues before. As I said previously, the public private partnership process, not only for this country but for other countries, is a learning one about how one spreads and shares the risk with the private sector. Some countries have embraced the process comprehensively. Spain and Portugal, which are probably leaders in the field, attempt to undertake all capital projects through PPP. We are not using it to anything like the extent envisaged in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and there are many reasons for this. People will argue that the schools project was a good deal which was completed quickly and efficiently, a design and build financed undertaking and that we should do more. Others argue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a point strongly contested by people in education. The other point is that the Department of Finance is correct in its view <Col N="15"/>that the cheapest way to finance a project is for the State to borrow the money. No one can fund a project more cheaply. The whole argument last year was that earmarking the proportion of the capital envelope for PPP would assist in speeding up many projects. We had a long argument concerning the figures used by EUROSTAT and how it dealt with them. That argument changed when it was no longer necessary to put the full cost of a project up front. In a PPP undertaking, only the proportion of the project affecting the year in question is dealt with. It is spread like a mortgage, over 20 years. That makes PPP far more satisfactory. However, it still does not make it more economic than the rate at which the Department of Finance can borrow and that is the central issue. Nonetheless, it enables projects to be moved more speedily, in many areas.</P>
        <P>There are different models and it is not always PPP. The Monasterevin road, which was opened yesterday, was not a PPP, but it was a design and build project. In the recent case of the Cork treatment plant, an incentive penalty mechanism was inserted to encourage delivery of infrastructure within set timeframes. In that case, the PPP arranged a structure so that the local authority would only take over a facility when it is satisfied it is operating properly. Until then the developer carries the cost of the operation. While the PPP heading encompasses a broad array of issues, in Europe it is defined in terms of whether there is a spreading or loading of the risk where the private sector may take a share of it. Now we see a number of PPP projects coming on stream, but not many. They are far fewer than envisaged under the national development plan. I do not believe there are any more in the field of education, except the Cork School of Music, which is still having difficulties with the PPP company involved. People are looking at different methods, such as incentive penalties. The Ringsend water plant is a former PPP as well and there are a number of other projects that have been undertaken in this way.</P>
        <P>I understand both sides of the argument well. We are doing some and not others, because of the cost issue. However, there is no doubt that it enables a project to be designed, built, financed and become operational far quicker than the other methods. It enables infrastructural projects to be moved with enormous speed. The Monasterevin road was not a PPP, but one should look at the speed at which this project was carried out as well as the Dublin water plant and the five schools. A great amount of time was gained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is missing the point. Monasterevin was not a PPP.</P>

	<P>It should not be rejected as a concept. In some areas it works very effectively.

What is his view on this and has he spoken to all the parties concerned? Why are we pursuing the building of a motorway and the compulsory purchase of land for it without giving thought to the provision of a rail line alongside it?

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question. I have listened to some of those involved, though not all. I have listened to those who say the motorway will do major damage to the Hill of Tara and I have listened to those who say it has nothing to do with it. The argument common to both sides is that the development will affect the Skryne valley. I have asked archaeologists, who are members of the country&rsquo;s fastest growing profession, and they differ in their views, as the Deputy knows. The NRA and the Department have asked them to come forward with a conclusive answer. As archaeologists, that is their job and it is not for the local authority, Deputy English or me to answer that. I will be very interested to see their conclusions.</P>
        <P>The position should be based on facts. I do not agree with having someone stand on the Hill of Tara with a camera and telling people that the <Col N="17"/>motorway will go through it. As the Deputy and I know, it will not. I went down to see how far away the proposed motorway was from the hill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 784 steps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not know the exact distance, it is certainly further than the existing road. There is an argument to be made about the Skryne valley, but there is none to be made about the hill of Tara which could not be seen from where I stood on the road. I do not see that argument.</P>
        <P>While I do not think there is a plan to provide a railway line, it would make sense to place a new line on the existing route. Of course, the matter can be discussed.</P>

It will be interesting to see if we will get a conclusive answer.</P>

        <Quest>the progress that has been made to date in regard to the restructuring of ADM, specifically the changes which have been made to the memorandum and articles of association of ADM to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to earlier replies to questions on this topic, in particular my reply to Question No. 127 on 27 April 2004 and Questions Nos. 186, 194, 198, 218 and 228 on 5 October 2004. As mentioned in these replies the first steps in the process of restructuring ADM has taken place with the appointment to the board of three persons nominated by Government. Following such appointments, work is now under way by ADM to develop appropriate changes to its articles and memorandum of association. Government approval will be required before changes are finalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not telling us much. In the context of the review, the Minister gave us that information in October, that is, that the Government nominees had been appointed to the board. In what direction is the review heading? Does the Minister regard it as vitally important that ADM retains its independent status as a buffer between his Department and community and voluntary groups on the ground? Does he agree that the representatives of the community and voluntary sectors should be retained in all the areas in which they are located? How will he ensure that the expertise built up by ADM during the past ten years is not lost in the context of the streamlining of delivery of service which appears to be the basis for the Government decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in what the Deputy had to say about the buffer. I can never understand why we need a buffer between ourselves and the electorate. Perhaps some day somebody will explain to me what the buffer is about. I could understand it in the case of a planning appeals authority but when providing direct services to the community we all serve, I cannot understand the reason we are paranoid about putting distance between ourselves and the electorate. The decision is that the board and the chair of the company are to be appointed by the Government. The name of the organisation is to change from ADM to Pobal &mdash; presumably the staff would say there is no reason for it, other than normal staff turnover, and that it will not happen.</P>
        <P>There are two major community sectors under the aegis of my Department, the CDP system and the partnerships. One&rsquo;s relationship to the Department is direct without the so-called buffer and the other is through ADM. If the Deputy considers there has to be an intermediary body, I am surprised he is not pressing that the CDPs operate in a similar way through an intermediary body. There appears to be an inconsistency there. That shows how the whole system grew up with a lack of consistency and now we are trying to bring to it a much more focused delivery in order that the people on the ground benefit from the money we are spending.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="21"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister asked why a buffer is necessary. The case has been made to me that where the Leader programmes had to interface with the Department of Agriculture and Food the relationship tended to be non-administrative in the context of how money was allocated. I have been informed that what was lacking was a grasp of what community development is all about and the skills and experience of people on the ground are being lost. A buffer is necessary in this area because Departments, if dealt with directly, tend to be more straight-laced and rigid in how they operate than a group that has operated in an independent capacity and which has no allegiance to either the Department or the sector. I do not accept the Minster&rsquo;s point that I was making a distinction between the community and voluntary sectors in terms of the area partnerships. I regard these as part of the process. Maybe the generic term I used was not sufficiently comprehensive, but I certainly had that in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy missed my point. I am saying that the community development programmes deal directly with the Department while the partnerships deal through ADM. If the Deputy believes the second method is the best, logically he should believe that it would also be good for the CDPs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy misunderstands the point regarding Leader. Leader&rsquo;s administration tends to be administrative because it is an EU programme bound by a sizeable book of rules. The Department does not have discretion as a consequence and therefore its main role is to administer the rules agreed with Brussels. The Leader companies appreciate this and have discussed it with me frequently. They know there is little room for manoeuvre.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the Deputy on the basis of my experience. I was a co-operative manager for many years and dealt with both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Department, Roinn na Gaeltachta. The consensus among the co-operative managers was that they would much prefer to deal directly with the Department than with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. This is not to cast a slur on the latter as I refer to its structure rather than its staff. Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s point related to the ADM. The co-operative managers felt there was much more flexibility, much less bureaucracy and more willingness to adapt to change in the Department. Most people working in the area, certainly those who shared my experience, would much rather deal directly with the Department.</P>

        <Quest>if grants have been paid out by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to a company (details supplied) in respect of a quarry located in Ballynahalla, Moycullen, which has been confirmed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s as being outside the <Col N="22"/>Gaeltacht area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 160 on 5 October 2004, a capital grant was approved by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in respect of the company referred to by the Deputy on the incorrect understanding that it was operating within the Gaeltacht boundary.</P>
        <P>I understand from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that appropriate steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of such anomalies. Moreover, I understand that, following a review of the matter in the course of an interim audit of the 2004 accounts of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Comptroller and Auditor General will not be taking any further action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer. Has he or his Department sought further information on other companies to which &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta might have granted money in similar circumstances in recent years? Is he aware of how prevalent this practice might be?</P>
        <P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s proposals or suggestions that Gaeltacht areas should be extended or boundaries redrawn, has he or his Department undertaken an audit to ascertain the effect such an extension would have on the allocation of grants by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in regard to certain industrial or other activities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the first question, I know of no other case where this happened. Knowing the circumstances and the topography of the case, it is a pity it happened. However, it was quite understandable that it happened and I understand that local people did not quite realise the location of the townland boundary. In many cases such a boundary is defined by a stream or abhantrach where the water comes off the hills, if there are hills. The place in question does not have hills. It is in a limestone region and all the water sinks below the surface. Therefore it was not so easy to define the townland boundary. It is obvious that what happened should not have happened. In fairness to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, it is taking steps to ensure that it will not happen again.</P>
        <P>On the second question, if the boundaries ever change in the Gaeltachta&iacute;, an issue we are considering, grants would only be paid within the new boundary from the date of the change. We experienced this when changes were made under the 1956 Act to Gaeltacht boundaries defined in the 1929 Act. There is a precedent for dealing with the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The case in question was one of misplaced geography and I accept the Minister&rsquo;s word on this. However, does his Department or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have a specific policy on the environmental impact of grants? The case to which I referred concerned a quarry, and the money given and the type of activity in which the <Col N="23"/>company was engaged obviously had an environmental impact. If the Minister has a policy on this, does it inform the decisions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta regarding the giving of grants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy is very clear. Anybody seeking a grant must fulfil all the laws that apply, including Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, with regard to environmental impact statements and planning permission specifications. The Deputy might have understood that the planning authority was of the opinion that planning permission was not required but it emerged some considerable time after the making of the grant that An Bord Plean&aacute;la made a different ruling. We pass laws and everybody applies them but we do not know whether somebody will bring a case to the Supreme Court to prove a law unconstitutional in ten years&rsquo; time. Until this happens, however, one cannot blame a person for acting within the law as it exists. A ruling was given that planning was not required in the case in question and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was perfectly correct to presume, once the local authority expressed its view to this effect, that the ruling was correct. We always apply this principle to legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The national drugs strategy provides for the establishment of ten regional drugs task forces. These task forces are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and also the range and level of existing services with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. A sum of &euro;500,000 has been provided by my Department in the current year for administrative and technical assistance costs incurred by the task forces in the preparation of their plans.</P>
        <P>The work being undertaken will, when complete, feed into the drafting of regional action plans which will then be assessed by the national drugs strategy team. The nature of the drug problems in the task forces&rsquo; areas and the gaps in existing services will be reflected in the action plans that are being developed. I hope all this work can be completed by early 2005 and that I will then be in a position to bring recommendations on the funding of the plans to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion for approval.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Estimates process for 2005 is ongoing. However, I expect <Col N="24"/>the regional drugs task forces to be in a position to begin the implementation of their plans during 2005.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the Department of Health and Children, which has overall responsibility for addiction services, reports that overall 7,091 people were receiving methadone treatment at the end of August 2004. This represents a 40% increase over a four-year period.</P>
        <P>With regard to the prevalence of drug misuse in the regions, the Deputy should note that a recent report by the Health Research Board showed that the numbers in treatment for heroin use outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority region, as opposed to the overall prevalence rate, have increased significantly. The best available figures on overall levels of use outside the ERHA region are those produced by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs last year, which estimated that there are approximately 12,400 opiate users in Dublin and 2,200 opiate users outside Dublin, although many of these users are in counties Wicklow and Kildare, which are in the ERHA region.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
        <P>In general, treatment services in the regions have followed a similar pattern to that observed in the ERHA region when treatment availability was expanded therein. Existing users are much more likely to come forward and present for treatment as it becomes more available, accessible and attractive. Accordingly, as the services have expanded, so have the numbers in treatment. I am sure the Deputy will agree that this is a positive development as it indicates that services are meeting an existing demand. Tackling the drug problem remains a priority for this Government and it is my intention that significant resources will continue to be targeted at the problem on a countrywide basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer was more of the same, especially his contention that the task forces are mapping out their plans and strategy. Will he make a commitment today to provide money in the forthcoming Estimates to fund the plans that are expected to be implemented early in 2005?</P>
        <P>For the past year or more, I have listened to comments to the effect that plans are being mapped out. We have our heads in the sand like ostriches. The Minister of State is charged with responsibility for the drugs task forces. Is he happy that they have not submitted their plans? He could not be happy and he should order them to submit them. The plans have not been submitted because the task force cannot afford to give them to us &mdash; &euro;50,000 to draw up a strategy and a plan to deal with the whole drugs issue. The Minister of State also said the number of people on treatment has increased. The task force is about preventative measures too, so that treatment will not be needed. We are half way through <Col N="25"/>the 2001-08 drugs strategy and we have gone backwards with regard to the numbers. Will the Minister admit that the policy has failed? The Minister should now agree to provide sufficient funding in this year&rsquo;s budget to deal with the issue, not a miserable &euro;50,000 for the task force. I do not want to ask the same question next June after the task force has submitted its plan, and hear the Minister say it was too late to get money in the budget because the Estimates were drawn up six months earlier. That will not be good enough. The money must be provided now to facilitate the plans. The task force needs to be driven forward to find solutions to the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing the members of the new regional drugs task force did when it was set up was to get to know one another and examine the services available within the region. There is no point submitting plans and seeking extra funding without carrying out an analysis of the services available and the resources needed and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about funding in this year&rsquo;s Estimates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a question and I am telling him the situation. No plan has been submitted from the ten regions. The plan from the Deputy&rsquo;s region is due within the next couple of weeks. The time scale for receiving all ten plans is next April. The plans will be assessed as they come in to see if the ideas are relevant. I will bring the findings to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and I expect they will be approved in the spring. I expect the plans will be in place from summer to autumn, depending on when we receive them. We must go through the proper process. Setting up and funding the plans was a key part of the strategy and this is happening.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue to which the Deputy referred, the mid-term review is taking place. If the Deputy or any other group has views on the matter, we will take them on board. Life is not perfect, but we are doing a significant amount of good work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State cannot be happy with the progress to date. I do not blame him completely for what is happening because it took three years to set up the task forces. The key question is whether funding will be provided in the Estimates to fund the plans. The Minister of State did not guarantee that the plans will be funded. There was no problem finding &euro;50,000 for the Aislinn group because an election was about to take place. If there was an election next year would money be provided for these groups?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Aislinn group received funding through the health board. I cannot announce the Estimates today, that will happen in the coming weeks. The plans will come in. So <Col N="26"/>far none of the plans from the ten regions have come in. I am confident they will be approved and that the task forces will be up and running next year.</P>

        <Quest>if, in relation to his letter in a newspaper (details supplied), he will elaborate on his comments that the outcry against the singing of the Irish national anthem in English at the Ryder Cup in America is evidence that the vast majority of the population has a positive attitude towards the Irish language; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27979/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The statement is self-explanatory and does not require elaboration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that making a daft statement about the vast majority of the population having a positive attitude towards the Irish language based on the fact that there was a complaint about the national anthem being sung in English at the Ryder Cup in the United States is a very unscientific statement? Will he agree further that we do not know the attitude to the Irish language of the vast majority of the population? We will not know that unless and until qualitative research is carried out or, alternatively, there is a referendum on the matter. My basic point is that a daft statement such as this damages the movement that seeks to preserve and promote the Irish language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may have missed the original article in which the allegation was made that there was general bad will towards the Irish language with just a few people interested in it. While travelling throughout the country, everywhere I go I find general goodwill towards the language. There has been research on this issue in the past. While I have a science background, the reality is that one of the best tests of popular opinion is the mood of this House. One thing that can be said of politicians of all colours is that they tend to get the way the wind is blowing fairly fast. Allowing for the fact that this House reflects the view of the people, there appears to be goodwill towards the Irish language. I will not waste significant sums of money carrying out qualitative research to debunk a wild statement made in a newspaper about lack of support for the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The general support for TG4 and the gaelscoileanna, indicates that the vast majority of people throughout the country support the Irish language in different forms. The fact that everyone sings the national anthem in Irish indicates that there is not a general antipathy towards the language, because if that were the case, people would sing it in English.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="27"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting a little bit of &ldquo;looking into our hearts and seeing what the Irish people want&rdquo;. The question I asked was based on a letter published in a national Sunday newspaper. The Minister has not addressed the issue of whether it was a ridiculous statement to say that, because some people objected to the national anthem being sung in English at the Ryder Cup, showed that the vast majority of the Irish people are favourable towards the Irish language. That sort of crazy logic does no service to those of us who want to see the Irish language preserved and promoted. We need to be much more accurate and scientific in what we say. I disagree with the Minister that qualitative research is not important. We need to know what people in general think about the language before we can move forward. In addition, it is extremely important to develop in the community at large an ownership attitude towards the Irish language. What we are getting is hit and miss policies and daft statements such as this, which are putting back the day when we can make real progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If we need qualitative research, and this is taking place, we can get it anytime. A comprehensive policy is being followed in regard to the language. We must also be careful about research, which is often largely influenced by how one asks a question. There is the famous case of the car manufacturer who asked people what kind of car they wanted. As most people like to appear sensible, they answered that they would like a very sensible solid car and so on. When the car went on the market it was a total failure. The second survey was carried out slightly differently. People were asked what they thought their neighbour would want and they said they would want a big flashy car, with plenty of gadgets such as electric windows and so on. That car sold like a bomb. The way one asks a question can prompt the answer. It is difficult to get to the hard science of the matter, no matter what sociologists tell us.</P>
        <P>As we are all aware, one of the reasons we need politicians is that, even though one might get all the evidence, it does not prove to be that useful when one tries to do the thing in practice. I am a great believer in the wisdom of the political system. It is often the best opinion poll of all because sometimes the antennae of politicians are much more accurate than surveys since sometimes questions are loaded to provide a specific answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister believes the waffle we have just heard has some significance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister stand over his statement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that the proof that the vast majority of the people support the language can be based on the fact that people objected to the national anthem being sung in English at the Ryder Cup competition? The Mini<Col N="28"/>ster has avoided the issue. Waffling is all very well&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave a straight answer on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not answer that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that so I cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can check, but I never said it was proof. I said there was general goodwill for the language and then said &ldquo;for example&rdquo; and gave the example. However, it was not a question of proof. Nobody can prove it. Even if we carry out the scientific survey the Deputy has mentioned, it will not prove anything. It only proves that on a certain day, a certain number of people express a certain view to a certain question. Proof in a mathematical sense is not available on any of these questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the role of F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge is to advise me on the advisability of preparing a 20-year strategic plan with realistic goals for the Irish language in the State; the short-term strategic priorities for the preservation and the promotion of the Irish language within the State; the priorities regarding the implementation of the Official Languages Act; and the best and <Col N="29"/>most practical ways to achieve progress with regard to the implementation of that work. Arising from that, it is hoped that there will be a more integrated approach among the main community and State organisations that promote the Irish language and a greater degree of co-ordination to their work.</P>
        <P>There have been two meetings of F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge to date. I have asked the members to submit their views on the development of an Irish language plan and related short-term priority issues. There has been a good response to this from the members, and officials of my Department are examining the various submissions. Consideration is also being given to the options for developing a framework, with assistance and advice from the forum, for a broad plan for the Irish language that would include strategic priorities for its preservation and promotion within the State. I anticipate that this work will be brought forward over the coming months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes sense that the first matter F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge should address is the short-term strategic measures, rather than a 20-year strategic plan. That is important. To return to the issue of research, we are making assumptions about the Irish language and do not know what people think. The Minister spoke about research being a measure of something on a day, but I am talking about qualitative research which will inform us of people&rsquo;s exact opinions. The research should be widely based so that we can be aware of them. When we do this we will understand better the problem that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>We must inculcate in people an attitude of ownership of the language. That is essential. The language does not belong to an elite or to small groups, but to all of us. If we do not engage with the population at large through a countrywide, open and frank debate where if people express a view that does not coincide with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that supplementary questions are limited to one minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not logical that F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge should focus on the short-term objectives and priorities and get going on those? We are losing the battle and there is no time to be lost.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the next minute take the short-term view. What I have been doing over my period as Minister of State and as Minister is developing coherent policies. These have to be implemented piecemeal as the opportunity occurs, but they form part of a coherent approach <Col N="30"/>to the language. One thing we must do, because it has not been done since the early 1920s, if it was ever cogently done, is lay out the State&rsquo;s policy. We are elected and should set out the State&rsquo;s policy towards the Irish language in 2004 and for the future.</P>
        <P>Nobody has laid out the policy so it would be beneficial if we, as the elected Government, set out our stall. We could then debate the issue and know what we aim to do and the objective. In the early years of the State, the replacement of English by the Irish language was the stated policy, but that policy has long since disappeared. However, it is fair to say that people have only a vague idea of the State&rsquo;s policy on the Irish language. I do not only mean the policy of the Government but of Governments over the past 30 or 40 years. It is time we stated our policy clearly.</P>
        <P>The policy must be set out as a long-term policy. Arising from that policy we should decide our long-term and short-term objectives. From that we can consolidate the short-term steps that must be taken. The Deputy is right that the policy to appoint&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>My attitude is clear, there is an absolute obligation on local authorities to comply with the law, which clearly states the objective of taking language criteria into account in making planning decisions.

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that on the one hand I ask him to take long-term measures and, on the other, to take short-term measures. There is nothing essentially wrong with that. Having examined the terms of reference of F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge, I see it as more important that the short-term strategic objectives be first set before the Minister and that he implements them. The 20-year strategy is a long-term one. We need action now.</P>
        <P>The Minister dealt with the census and mentioned that more than 1 million people speak the Irish language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>They know the Irish language. There are not more than 1 million people who say they speak it. We need to be accurate about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>We certainly need to be accurate about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>They claim they know it. Usage is another question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that the answers to the questions in the census are subjective. How does one measure fluency on the basis of what is said by a fluent speaker and what is said by somebody who speaks very little Irish? There is no way of measuring that, although the Central Statistics Office stands over the validity of its findings. However, each person answers that question according to his or her own standards and criteria. I wish it were so but I do not believe the position is as strong as it seems.</P>
        <P>I do not see why the Minister has a problem with what I suggest. F&oacute;ram na Gaeilge should report first with the short-term objectives and the Minister should implement them quickly because things are not going well and we need to change that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Beidh mise i bfhad n&iacute; ba ghaire d&rsquo;anail&iacute;s an Teachta McGinley. There are very good signs in certain areas and huge threats in other areas. It is not all in one direction. That is one of the complexities of the issue.</P>
        <P>There were complaints about committees and studies. I confirm that on language issues there is only one study, namely, the staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta. This is a time for action. The committee is purely advisory and I envisage it being available to advise Ministers in the future. However, it will <Col N="33"/>not constrain me at any time from taking action because the power to take action remains with the Minister. I have consistently taken action. In the past five years there has been a consistent roll-out of action. It is important for the State to define what the objective is and I am surprised that the Deputy is not fully supportive of this. I believe that when he reflects on it he will see the logic of it. The objective is not that of the 1920s and 1930s. My point is that we cannot have even short-term strategies in a coherent framework unless we decide where this nation wants to go regarding the language.</P>
        <P>One interesting fact I heard yesterday is that many asylum seekers are particularly interested in our culture. It is important therefore, for people coming into this country as well, that there is a clear statement regarding where the Irish language fits into our future. Time and again I have articulated a bilingual view. No child in this country should be deprived of a full knowledge of the English language, a fantastic world resource. I am also very strongly of the view that it is increasingly possible, particularly with modern technology, that neither should any child in this country be denied an opportunity to be fluent in the Irish language, and that bilingualism is a realistic norm to aim at. It must be stated clearly what it is we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 89 and 101 together.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been achieved regarding the implementation of recommendations in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector.</P>
        <P>Core funding recommendations in the White Paper are being addressed. For example, in September 2003 I announced some &euro;7.3 million in funding to 56 organisations in the community and <Col N="34"/>voluntary sector over a three year period under schemes to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies and to provide training and supports to the sector; funding of &euro;1.43 million per annum is being channelled to the anti-poverty networks; and funding of some &euro;1.28 million per annum is being provided for the continuing development of the highly successful community and voluntary fora, established as an important element of the local government reform process.</P>
        <P>In the matter of policy recommendations arising from the White Paper a consultation paper on one of its most important recommendations entitled Establishing a Modern Statutory Framework for Charities was posted on my Department&rsquo;s website on 17 December last. In early February I formally launched a public consultation on the issue and a notice inviting submissions was placed in the national newspapers. The public consultation will inform the development of the forthcoming legislation in this area. In recent weeks I was pleased to publish the external report on the public consultation.</P>
        <P>Deputies will also be aware that an implementation and advisory group comprising representatives from the voluntary and statutory sectors was established to monitor and advise on the implementation of the White Paper. Substantive matters considered to date by the IAG include the multiplicity of funding sources through which the sector must operate, the designation of voluntary activity units in relevant Government Departments, accreditation of training in the sector, support for volunteering and the establishment of good practice standards in both the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector.</P>
        <P>The White Paper indicated that a review of the IAG should take place after a three year period. Work on this review is continuing in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt><?oasys _dc10-?>
	<P>I have tabled a number of questions on this area. It is a grey area of Government policy and the Minister&rsquo;s reply is insufficient to throw any real light on it. The White Paper on supporting voluntary activity was published in September 2002. It set out a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector. An implementation and advisory group was established and, after three years, a formal review was to take place. When will there be a formal review? The members of the advisory group have been seeking to participate in a review since May. Can the Minister confirm that he is not stalling regarding the review? When can we expect it to be carried out?</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>What has the Department been doing regarding the provision of multi-annual funding for the community and voluntary sector, which again is a bugbear, according to people in the sector? There was mention in the White Paper of enabling voluntary sector activity in such areas as <Col N="35"/>accreditation of learning volunteers and an improved regulatory framework. The reality, however, is one of <i>ad hoc</i> rather than long-term funding. Instead of empowering and encouraging the voluntary sector, the message from Government seems to be one of disinterest. One of the IAG&rsquo;s reviews mentioned the lack of continuity of membership on the statutory side, the selection of junior personnel for the committees and statutory members not being given a mandate from the Department. This sector is being treated with contempt and there is no indication of when the review will be published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was always said that the IAG would be reviewed after three years. Its mandate ended in July 2004 and the review is being completed. For now, the IAG as a group is still meeting and continuing its work. Papers have been exchanged between the Department and the IAG but a decision as to how we move forward into the future will be made quite soon.</P>
        <P>I have already explained the position regarding funding. This was an issue of hot debate for a time but the funding was announced last year and it is going to a number of bodies. Perhaps some who hoped to receive funding did not, or did not receive the sum they hoped, but substantial funding has been provided to the sector under the two headings and this is ongoing on a three-year basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that one of the most important supports for the voluntary sector is that the recommendations of the report, Tipping the Balance, be implemented? This provides that a legal framework be put in place for the voluntary sector. If this does not happen, the current situation where volunteers are becoming scarcer on the ground will continue. I fail to see why the Government had this report drawn up when it has done nothing about it. It is an important underpinning of the voluntary sector and essential to its proper development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report, Tipping the Balance, was about volunteers rather than paid staff and this report is being reviewed. It got tied into general reforms which are being carried out within the Department. One of the ideas contained in the report was the establishment of volunteer bureaux throughout the country. We are in favour of these in many ways but, in trying to co-ordinate the work of the various groups and bodies under the aegis of the Department, we felt it unnecessary to establish an entirely new network of volunteer bureaux. We considered that some of the existing groups could attempt to push forward the idea within the existing frameworks between CDPs, partnerships, drugs task forces, and so on. We were reluctant, therefore, to set up a new network for the moment while still attempting to establish some coherence among existing organisations.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="36"/>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the pre-budget submission by the Community Partnership Network and its concerns that, between 2002 and 2004, there was a reduction of almost 20% in its budget. It is anxious to have its budget restored to what it was in 2002. Can it expect its submission to be received sympathetically and that there will be a favourable decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister share the opinion of many in the community development sector that part of the reason there is not ongoing support from the Government is the fear that the sector represents an alternative to politics? Rather than the old approach of cumainn and branches, people can now effect development in their own communities, discover the nature of their own difficulties and seek to find their own resources. It is because of this threat that the Government is not responding adequately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding funding, the Estimates will be released within the next two weeks and Deputy McGinley will see the funding available under the various headings. We are working towards what was outlined in the White Paper, which was fundamentally concerned with improving the relationship between the State and the agencies. The question of how this should be done is the subject of ongoing consultation and discussion.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s question, people on different sides have different expectations as to what can be achieved. Much progress has been made and significant funding has been provided, which was one of the Department&rsquo;s key objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government promised in its programme for Government to cut average class sizes. This was not just an election promise but rather a firm commitment in the programme for Government. The programme stated that &ldquo;over the next five years, we will progressively introduce maximum class guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine years of age will be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1&rdquo;. That commitment is now another broken contract and amounts to nothing more than an announcement to the nation by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, that this has now become a noble aspiration.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach continue to preside over a Government where, day after day, each time Ministers speak, they either put their foot in it or break another promise? What type of Government is the Taoiseach leading? The reality is that the INTO says this objective is doable. The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is not entirely to blame in this but she sat at the Cabinet table for the last two and a half years where these decisions were made and where, because of mismanagement and bad planning, the Taoiseach and his Government have arrived at the end of the year with a litany of broken contracts that become noble aspirations.</P>
      <P>Next year, there will be 1,000 graduates from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Training College in Dublin and Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, 300 more from the smaller colleges and 400 from the on-line course run by Hibernia College. There will be approximately 800 teachers lost between retirements and those leaving the system. Inside the next two and a half years, therefore, this is doable. What does the Taoiseach say to the parents of the 110,000 children in class sizes of 30 or more today? What does he say to parents of the 250,000 children who are in class sizes of between 20 and 30? We are way above the European average. What is beginning to happen is that mainline education is suffering because of bad planning by the Taoiseach and his Government. I want the Taoiseach to speak to the nation and <Col N="38"/>tell the people how a broken contract has become a noble aspiration.</P>

	<P>It is an awful pity the Deputy&rsquo;s party did not put a few more trainee teachers into teacher training schools when he had an opportunity to do so when there were fewer than 500 such students. However, we now at least have 1,280 students coming through the teacher training schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that point shortly. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in recent years. These additional teachers have been used to reduce class sizes, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs. The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in 1996-97 to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Average class sizes have been reduced from 26.6 to 23.9 in the corresponding years. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in Giving Children an Even Break or in the Breaking the Cycle programme. Approximately 47,700 pupils in participating schools availed of reduced class sizes of 15 to 20 pupils. The annual intake of undergraduate students in the teacher training colleges has increased from fewer than 500 in 1996 to more than 1,000 in 2004. A further 280 places or thereabouts have been provided in postgraduate teacher training courses this year, bringing to 1,280 the number of students entering our teacher training colleges this year.</P>
      <P>It is true that we have not yet done what we set out to do, but the Government is committed to reaching its target. Along the way it has examined the figures, identified where the problems are arising and assigned teachers to those areas where there is educational disadvantage and social exclusion to try to reduce the class sizes in those areas. That has been successful, although it has not been completed, but the position has been improved dramatically.</P><Col N="39"/>
      <P>The programme for Government states the objective in respect of class sizes. Deputy Kenny was correct in respect of the class sizes for under nine year olds. We will continue to work towards the objective. Deputy Kenny correctly quoted the figures for the number of pupils in classes. Some 700 teachers retire every year. We are unlikely to increase the capacity of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, the Limerick college or the smaller college to the level to take account of that, even though there are capital programmes under consideration in some of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could if we had the political will to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that as teachers come on board, we have to either slavishly follow what was set down or examine the more appropriate area to which to assign them, for which I make no apologies. Deputy Kenny asked me to speak to the nation. If they are listening, and I hope they are, we made a decision to assign 2,500 teachers to resource education &mdash; in respect of which we did not make a promise &mdash; rather than just reduce the PPR to assist those most in need. If it is a question of resources and whether one stands for the upper echelons of society or for those on the margins, I stand by the people on the margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach started off by saying that it is good to start with the truth. It is also good to stand by the truth. He is reverting to his ethics in Government, which is to get in here and stay here at all costs.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Taoiseach understands just how bad this position is. When he speaks of resources in the area of special education, the position is that the Department of Education and Science is advising principals not to contact it by telephone about any problems. Does the Taoiseach understand there are 6,000 assessments untouched in the Department? Does he understand that when he said he is moving to a rights-based system of education for children with special needs that there are all of those thousands of assessments in the Department? At a time when an assessment triggered a placement and a facility for educating those children, the teaching hours of those special needs children are now being reduced from five hours to two hours. Has he spoken to any of the parents of those children? Does he understand the frustration these parents feel when they say the Minister for Education and Science and the Taoiseach have broken their contract and have been telling the people lies?</P>

	<P>It is also incorrect to say that there have not been changes in the special needs area. It is only a fortnight since the announcement of the later tranche of the 500 new special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Kenny wants to broaden his first question, then I must broaden the answer to it. It is correct that a consultative process on the future direction of education policy has been under way around the country. We have enacted the legislation for special needs, which is to underpin the rights of children with special needs. We have established a special educational council to facilitate the delivery of the support services for pupils with disabilities in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should tell that to parents of children who are losing resource teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The OECD has engaged in the strategic review of third level education. It has issued a report. We have targeted, support measures for disadvantaged schools. Some 2,276 schools have benefited. Some 4,000 additional teachers have been appointed at primary level. An additional 2,337 teachers have been appointed at post-primary level. The pupil teacher ratio at primary level has been reduced to just over 17:1. The number of teacher training places has been increased by 30%. The pupil teacher ratio for second level, which we are not discussing now, has also been reduced. Since 1997 the number of teaching posts has also been increased dramatically. We have put in enormous resources to support children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>While we did not do exactly what is provided for in the programme for Government, I will not say that it was not a right decision to assign resource teachers, special needs teachers, as against what was provided for because it was the right thing to do. It is correct to help the people who are disadvantaged rather than to slavishly <Col N="41"/>follow a figure.

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by way of a reply to my colleague, Deputy Stagg, when he ruled out an inquiry into the particularly brutal murder of two patients in Grangegorman in March of 1997, the Taoiseach will recall that a youth from my constituency, Dean Lyons, was arrested, questioned and remanded in custody on being charged with this particularly gruesome crime, which took place in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency. He will remember that that youth was questioned on video and gave a pretty inconsequential statement. Following the video being turned off, he made a confession to the two murders, a confession that was expressed in the kind of detail and language that he would not have known unless it had been fed to him. Subsequently, another man admitted to what appeared to be the same crime. Two people confessed to a crime which only one could have committed. Dean Lyons was released and the charges against him dropped. Some seven years on, is it satisfactory that no one has been charged for these crimes and is it not a shameful way in which to treat the three families involved, namely, those of the two women murdered and that of Dean Lyons? Moreover, in one sentence the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform ruled out an inquiry. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that these families should have been treated in this disgraceful way? The fear among the public is that a suspect was readied up for a terrible crime he did not commit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s core point that the three families remain affected by that terrible day on the outskirts of Grangegorman, on which two people were brutally and savagely murdered having been stabbed multiple times. I remember that during the Garda investigation into Dean Lyons, many people articulated their suspicions about whether or not he was responsible. As I recall, a person came forward subsequently who had been involved in other offences, although my recollection may not be correct.</P>
      <P>I assume the reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not been prepared to order an investigation into this matter is that it is always the practice when a Garda file on a case remains open and under investigation. I assume that is the case, but I can check with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and revert to the Deputy. If it is not the case, I am sure the Garda&rsquo;s view of Dean Lyons, who I <Col N="42"/>understand was cleared by the investigations, has been examined. However, I would have to examine the case as it happened some years ago. As no one was charged with the murders, I understand that the investigation remains open, in which case the type of investigation referred to by Deputy Rabbitte would not be undertaken. However, I will have to check if that is the position with the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept it is a long time ago and that the Taoiseach needs to refresh his memory. My point is that no one has yet been charged with the murders some seven years later. An internal Garda inquiry was undertaken, the results of which were never made public. Does the Taoiseach contend that because the investigation file is still open, the circumstances in which a not particularly literate youth who was a known drug abuser confessed in the Queen&rsquo;s English to circumstances about which he could not have known, must be left without being inquired into? Is he satisfied with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in a reply to Deputy Stagg stating that &ldquo;following consideration of the matter, I am not at present satisfied that a public inquiry is required&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I am not asking for a public inquiry or any inquiry which would imply in people&rsquo;s minds another tribunal. However, I refer the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to his own Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which I thought we put in place precisely for this kind of purpose, namely, so that an investigation into a matter of profound public interest may be conducted speedily, efficiently and relatively very cheaply.</P>
      <P>In a reply to a question from Deputy Costello last week, the Minister stated that some 750 civil actions are extant against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There is much public disquiet about this case. Three families are very distressed by the fact that no charges have been brought and it requires the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s point and will raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The language used by the Deputy is employed when an investigation file is still open or is reviewed on a regular basis and, in such cases, the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the DPP tend not to pursue any inquiry. I also admit that seven years is a long time to wait if clouds hang over someone, or if pressures hand over someone as in the case of Dean Lyons, not to mention the families of the murdered people in this case. Except on rare occasions, internal Garda inquiries are not normally published. However, I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and inform Deputy Rabbitte of his views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, sought to compare Aer Lingus with airlines which have gone out of business. He even tried to claim that the company&rsquo;s financial position was somewhat fragile. Will the Taoiseach clarify or correct that impression because the reality is that the company is robust, thanks mainly to the efforts and sacrifices of staff and management down the years, which has been acknowledged by the Taoiseach? As the Taoiseach knows, Aer Lingus has shown substantial profits since 1995. The company predicts profits of more than &euro;95 million this year and has accumulated profits of &euro;248 million since 2002. Will the Taoiseach clarify that the airline is financially healthy?</P>
      <P>In that context, what is the Government&rsquo;s position in the face of measures to prepare Aer Lingus for privatisation? Does the Taoiseach accept that an island economy is vulnerable enough without losing its national airline? Moreover, has he had time to reflect on the experience in New Zealand where the Government sold Air New Zealand in 1988 for NZ $660 million and had to rescue it from bankruptcy in 2000 at a cost of almost NZ $2 billion? After its privatisation, schedules were cut back, aircraft were diverted to larger markets in Australia and south east Asia and tourism was decimated. Does the Taoiseach want to risk repeating that experience and will the Government make its position clear so management of the airline has some guidance as to where the Government wants to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The management of Aer Lingus is in regular contact and discussions with the Minister so it is very clear on the issue. The management, trades unions and workers at all levels in Aer Lingus have done a very good job in recent years in spite of the climate faced by the aviation industry. In order to deal with the difficult circumstances, they had to take appropriate action to turn the airline around, bring it to profitability and try to sustain it. There is no argument about the issue and they should be congratulated for their efforts, which I have done on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>The airline has stated that its capital base for future acquisitions needs to be increased. A sum of &euro;95 million will not even buy an aeroplane and the company wants to extend its routes and build formal and informal strategic links with other carriers from the Persian Gulf, Asia and elsewhere in order to build Aer Lingus for the future so that it continues to survive in ten or 20 years&rsquo; time, regardless of how it is constituted. It is not a question of selling it. It is a question of trying to form strategic alliances in whatever arrangements are to be discussed, to ensure that it is healthy, unlike airlines elsewhere that have bitten the dust savagely due to the prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>That is the issue to be addressed. It is not a question of what anybody is doing wrong, it is about what we can do right to sustain, maintain <Col N="44"/>and grow the airline into the future. That is the challenge and it is best to comprehend and address it by doing what is necessary at this stage, rather than waiting until we hit an aviation downturn again, which is almost inevitable. We have had two in the past ten years. It is not the fault of anyone in Aer Lingus but it happens for one reason or another, whether it is because of terrorism or economic issues. Currently, it is due to rising fuel prices which are forcing airlines to bear astronomical costs. The airlines had based their costs on crude oil selling at $30 to $32 a barrel, whereas now it has risen to $50 plus. No one in the airline industry here created those difficulties but such issues must be addressed in terms of future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach say, although it is obvious, that &euro;95 million would not buy the kind of aeroplanes Aer Lingus is seeking. I acknowledge, however, that the Taoiseach probably knows a bit more about buying aeroplanes than I do.</P>

	<P>Recently the House passed the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, which will allow the ESB to borrow in the order of &euro;6 billion in the new market situation in which the company finds itself. In the context of borrowings, what difference does the Taoiseach see between the ESB and Aer Lingus? Is it not the case that if either company requires capital &mdash; as has been mentioned, Aer Lingus certainly requires capital, although a business plan would be useful to see exactly how much &mdash; the Government will be prepared to underwrite that borrowing? If the Government is considering it for the ESB, can the same not be done for Aer Lingus? Before Aer Lingus proceeds with such severe outsourcing, will the Government insist that a full business plan is provided, rather than have a three-year strategy, which effectively deals with outsourcing and ceasing activities. Will the House and Aer Lingus management be told what Government policy concerns Aer Lingus in the long term, rather than waiting for the company&rsquo;s management to tell the Government what its job is?</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government treat Aer Lingus in the same way as it treats the ESB, by underwriting borrowing if it needs it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, under the terms of the recent Electricity (Amendment) Bill, the Government is not underwriting the borrowing. The ESB is in a very different position. It is a strong, cash-rich company.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="45"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has enormous resources and reserves to deal with these circumstances and, therefore, the two companies are not the same. Discussions on Aer Lingus have been going on for a long time to try to assist the company. We have been trying to bring the company through its problems for the past 11 or 12 years, since it went into difficulties in the 1992-93 period. That policy has been working well and is to the credit of the staff, including the various managers, as well as people on the board. We are trying to maintain and sustain Aer Lingus so that it will not be like practically all the other airlines around the world, which have either gone out of business or have been fundamentally restructured. If we are to keep a strong Aer Lingus we will have to examine its means of obtaining capital and resources to do the things it wants to do, such as expanding its services. We have to examine new sources of revenue for Aer Lingus to deal with these issues. That is the Government&rsquo;s policy.</P>

    <Title>Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In his opening remarks in the debate, the Minister referred to the 11,000 people in legal limbo since the L &amp;  O decision, saying that this number proves that he was right all along in accusing non-nationals of coming here solely for the purpose of exploiting our immigration laws. In saying so he ignored a fact of which he is surely aware and which has been mentioned in the course of contributions on the Bill, namely, that a significant proportion of those 11,000 people were advised by statutory agencies after they arrived that they should have a child to be guaranteed residency.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The policies in place at the time had no bearing on their decision to come to Ireland and it is disgraceful to cast such aspersions on the motivations of so many people. While it may have been true for a small number among that greater number, as a result of that contribution and others, everybody has been lumped together and so accused.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s statement epitomises one of the most deplorable aspects of the State&rsquo;s approach to immigration, namely, the disregard, suspicion and, at times, outright contempt with which it treats immigrants from the moment they arrive or, in the case of these applicants, they make known their desire to enter this State. Non-nationals, particularly those from African or certain eastern European countries, are looked upon and often portrayed as spongers, scroungers and criminals, trying to exploit every so-called loophole available to leech off the State.</P>
      <P>The Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has encouraged this view time and again, certainly during the recent referendum campaign, and the Minister in his opening contri<Col N="51"/>bution to this debate further fuelled that view. It is reflected in the way the immigration authorities, not always but sadly all too often, treat those seeking to come to Ireland. Visa applications are routinely denied with no reason given. The applicant is told to call a number that is only accessible, at least theoretically, for seven and a half hours a week. That is the only way they attempt to establish the reason for denial of the application. In my experience it is virtually impossible to get through during those seven and a half hours. The system is so overburdened that telephone calls are &mdash; I repeat the view I expressed &mdash; automatically disconnected. The Minister denied that claim in a recent reply to a parliamentary question that I submitted. I ask him or his associates to check this, to undertake an examination of how this works, and he will find that what I am saying is the actuality of people&rsquo;s experience.</P>
      <P>Of course, the fact that the denial letters do not give a reason for denial has much to do with why the telephone lines are overburdened. The Department should provide the reason for denial in those letters. That would certainly address many of the inquiries and lessen the burden of telephonic inquiry on the applicant who has been denied and the officials in the system.</P>
      <P>Naturalisation applicants are also routinely turned down without being told why. If they want a reason they must file a freedom of information request. This beggars belief. The system should be open and transparent, and people should be given the information.</P>
      <P>The position is even worse for non-nationals seeking employment under the work permit system. There is no one for these people to contact. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will only accept queries from employers. Much has been said about the opportunities that exist within the work permit system for the exploitation of those workers. The Department&rsquo;s refusal to speak to them only facilitates this and fuels the distrust, not only among those applying but also among many of our own population who are concerned about these matters.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s dim view of non-nationals is reflected in its reasons for refusals. Several months ago, in a highly publicised case, a Cuban grandmother was denied a holiday visa although she had been granted two previous holiday visas without incident. That case was reversed after an outcry, but the experience from my constituency is that there are many other such cases. On one occasion a worker in my office managed to get through to the visa section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and was told: &ldquo;We do not issue visas to widows because they are only coming here to baby-sit.&rdquo; That is exactly what was said to my staff member, who noted it very carefully during the course of the exchange. This happened twice, both times involving Indian <Col N="52"/>nationals seeking to visit their sons, their Irish wives and their grandchildren. If there is a policy to prevent widows who are mothers and grandmothers from coming here because they are only coming to baby-sit their grandchildren, the Minister should be honest and tell us about it. I assure him that is exactly what was said to my staff member. It is a contemptible attitude for any Department to take and I am deeply offended by it.</P>
      <P>The Government has refused to issue new work permits in certain categories deemed ineligible. The purpose of this policy, allegedly, is to protect jobs in categories where the Government believes there is no shortage of EU workers. This refusal extends even to those non-nationals who are already working in those categories. There will be no net loss of EU jobs if these workers are allowed to change employers. This senseless policy serves only to bind those workers to their employers. The Government denies this is the case on the grounds that those workers can find jobs in so-called eligible categories, but this argument is specious. The reality is &mdash; this is so widely acknowledged that one suspects the Government is in denial about it &mdash; that many of these workers are shackled to their employers and are unable to change jobs. I would welcome statistics that prove me wrong but, unfortunately, when my colleague. Deputy Morgan, attempted in the previous D&aacute;il session to obtain these statistics from the T&aacute;naiste, he was met with the incredible reply that they are not kept.</P>
      <P>I was flabbergasted to hear the Minister say in his opening remarks that this State &ldquo;wholeheartedly subscribes&rdquo; to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 7 of that convention states that the child shall have &ldquo;as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents&rdquo;. Article 9 states: &ldquo;a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will except when ... such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child&rdquo;. The Government is in blatant contravention of these articles with its policy of not granting reunification visas to the children of those parents who were granted leave to remain in Ireland prior to the L &amp;  O decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the detail of a specific case on which we have exchanged correspondence and about which I feel passionately upset. It has been a most disturbing experience dealing with that case, but, alarmingly, there are many other such cases. I appeal to the Minister. It gives me no pleasure to point constantly to what I see as flawed and wrong in the system. I would be far happier commending the Minister and I look forward to the day when perhaps he will listen to some of our concerns and address them within the system. The reunification of children in all those cases that apply prior to the L &amp;  O case would be a statement of the compassion of the people of this island for those who are most in need globally. I urge the Minister, even in the <Col N="53"/>spirit of the upcoming Christmas period, to take such a bold step. He will certainly earn the applause and the appreciation of this Deputy, and I will not be slow to express it.</P>
      <P>If I had more time, I could highlight a number of other serious flaws in our immigration system which are long overdue for reform and in much greater need of urgent action than the issue addressed in this Bill. Perhaps I will get another opportunity to cover them, although I would probably need to go through the detail of them with great care.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose this Bill as it has opposed all the other anti-immigration Bills, as I view them, brought before this House. It is not my penchant always to oppose. I genuinely and sincerely hope legislation will be brought before this House which represents the real and caring disposition of the overwhelming majority of the people and which I will be able to happily support. However, this is not such an occasion. It is time for legislation to protect our immigrants rather than demonise them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a greater responsibility now that there are increased numbers of non-nationals coming to our country. The number of non-nationals working here has more than doubled since 2000. Some 18,000 people received work permits to work here in 2000, a figure which rose to 47,551 in 2003. As a result of a need for more workers in our economy, many more non-nationals are coming to this country and we have responded by giving them the necessary work permits. That gives us a greater responsibility to ensure that we are all-embracing and inclusive, which we have not been. Our laws need to be amended to give a level of fairness.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced for a particular purpose but it also should have introduced greater fairness into the system. There has been a call for an amnesty for Irish citizens born before the referendum and the Supreme Court decision of January 2003. These people should be taken into consideration. The way we treat non-nationals is unfair.</P>
      <P>The situation in respect of asylum is predicated on one-to-one interviews. It is the individual&rsquo;s responsibility to prove his or her case. The burden of proof is on the asylum seeker who often does not have any documentation to back up his or her story. His or her credibility is tested at every turn in an interrogation process which can be very harrowing and frightening for people, especially for those who do not have a full command of the English language and for those who have suffered great trauma in their own countries. This system is not entirely fair and is not one over which we can stand. We are known as the Irish of the welcomes, but is our welcome is wearing out when it comes to non-nationals? It works both ways in that we need non-nationals to help us to drive our economy. As I said, we have a responsibility in that regard.</P><Col N="54"/>
      <P>I brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the unfair system which allowed a Burundi national to be deported from this country to which she had fled because she had exhausted the appeals systems in the UK where she had first entered the system. She had made an application in the UK and under the Dublin Convention, she was obliged to be returned to London to where she was deported in the dead of night by the immigration unit. She was given one hour&rsquo;s notice and was taken away by strangers to travel on a long lonely road to Dublin with her two daughters aged seven and five. They had been resident in Kiltimagh, County Mayo, and had, I suppose, been adopted by the community there. The community appreciated this woman&rsquo;s fear of deportation to Burundi where she had been treated very badly. The transfer under the Dublin Convention was an administrative matter as she had made her original application for asylum in the UK, her original point of entry. The fact the Garda immigration unit left Dublin at 6 p.m. implies that this was very much a calculated plan to steal this unfortunate woman and her family away under the cover of darkness to avoid the public outcry which would have resulted if the people of Kiltimagh had realised what was going on.</P>
      <P>The treatment of this woman raises serious questions about how we look after people who are less fortunate than ourselves. It also raises serious questions about the system which needs to be reviewed. I would like to see a review of the system in legislation rather than what is before us. We cannot think about bureaucratic efficiency over people&rsquo;s feelings. The system should have consideration for people and their feelings, particularly as in the case of this woman who was so traumatised having witnessed the murder of family members, having been the subject of rape and having seen members of her family treated very badly. This is a matter about which I feel strongly.</P>
      <P>In the case of asylum seekers, there is a presumption of guilt and they must try to prove their case. The more horrific their circumstances, the greater the task they have to try to prove their case. Often good medical evidence is not taken into account which should be. I have major problems with the system. Will the Minister re-examine this matter? It may be too late for this Burundian lady who has been deported to the UK and who may be deported to Burundi in due course, but will the Minister re-examine this case which has been through our system? This lady has been treated very badly. The Minister has many matters on his plate but this case is important. People from Kiltimagh followed this lady to London and have kept vigil with her as she goes through various traumas in the UK from which she is under threat of deportation. I hope the Minister will reconsider her situation.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate which has been fairly wide-<Col N="55"/>ranging. I acknowledge and state my appreciation for the support signalled by Fine Gael for the proposals which reflect Ireland&rsquo;s welcome and high regard for those who come to Ireland from aboard to establish themselves and share in and contribute to Irish society. Contributions on all sides ranged across many issues and concerns in the area of asylum and immigration. In so far as possible, I propose to address the main points and queries raised in the debate. Other matters raised which are of direct relevance to the detail of the Bill can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the history of the investment-based naturalisation scheme, which this Bill seeks to put beyond possibility for good and all. Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe specifically referred to the history of the scheme in the period 1988-94. I will address this matter in some detail.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 set out five conditions which must be fulfilled prior to the grant of a certification of naturalisation. The decision to nationalise is at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice of the day. Therefore, the Act of 1956 empowers the Minister to refuse a certificate even where all the conditions are fulfilled. There may be cases where previous Ministers for Justice have refused, at their absolute discretion, to grant a certificate of naturalisation and where I, or another Minister for Justice, might have taken the opposite view and granted the application. Conversely, the Minister can waive statutory conditions for naturalisation in the case of certain categories of person, even if one or all of those conditions remain unfulfilled. My predecessors and I have considerable powers of discretion in these matters under the Act of 1956. It is not a power vested in the Government but in the Minister, personally, as a corporation sole.</P>
      <P>Again, there may be cases where previous Ministers for Justice would or would not have waived any or all of the conditions for naturalisation and where I might have taken a contrary view. It is important to recognise, therefore, that the exercise of absolute discretion by the Minister of the day is a central element of the naturalisation process. The fact that I or any other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the benefit of hindsight, might disagree with a decision cannot be construed as an assertion that the certificate in question was improperly issued, in terms of its legality.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1956 gave no guidance on the precise meaning of the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. As was stated in this House at the time, various Deputies queried whether having a drink in a bar in Cairo might qualify for Irish association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Act of 1956 gave no guidance as to the precise meaning of the term &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo;. The rules of the investment-based naturalisation scheme were administrative in character and form no part of the legislative regime underpinning the naturalisation process. I am on record as having described the scheme that operated as being dependent on a very loose, questionable interpretation of the 1956 Act. The possibility of that interpretation ever being availed of in the future will be put to bed as a result of the contents of this Bill. However, the fact that I hold that view cannot be construed as implying that naturalisation certificates were, by that very fact, not issued in good faith, or that they were automatically unlawful. To revoke a naturalisation certificate on the basis of my view of the law now would be fraught with legal difficulty.</P>
      <P>In terms of an inquest of what happened during the scheme&rsquo;s lifespan, I remind Deputies of two things. The first is that that files relating to the naturalisation of 128 persons as a consequence of the scheme were sent to the Moriarty tribunal on 18 November 1998, on foot of an order dated 11 November 1998. These included all of the cases to which Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe referred, which were dealt with in the first five years of the scheme&rsquo;s operation. Four policy files were sent on foot of the same order and in addition, files relating to a further 15 applications for naturalisation, which were not part of the scheme, were sent to the Moriarty tribunal on 15 March 1999, on foot of an order dated 3 March 1999. My Department continues to co-operate with the tribunal. That co-operation is recent and ongoing.</P>
      <P>In addition, one of the first things I did on assuming office was to publish the report of the review group on investment-based naturalisation. A number of copies were placed at the time in the Oireachtas Library. I also issued a press statement, which was widely reported in the media and I ensured the report would be available on the Department&rsquo;s website. That report shows that the whole focus of activity after September 1996 was on the processing of applications that were pending or outstanding at that time. My immediate predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, accepted no new applications from investors as regards the scheme. However, once a scheme is in place a Minister must operate it fairly and bring it to an orderly conclusion. That was a difficulty faced by successive Ministers for Justice in the context of the winding up operation which went on from that period.</P><Col N="57"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>Several Deputies criticised our immigration policies and procedures, some going so far as to claim, mistakenly, that there is no immigration policy. I acknowledge that there is a need for comprehensive immigration and residence legislation and there is a commitment within An Agreed Programme for Government to that effect. I have already stated that I intend to launch a discussion document on that legislation in the near future and I am also committed to bringing forward proposals in this regard in 2005. I also point out that my predecessor as Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, on 13 June 2001, launched a public consultation document on immigration policy. It is interesting to note that no party in this House and many of the commentators who criticised immigration policy, provided observations on Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue&rsquo;s document. The result of that consultation process are available for all to see on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, however, that the absence of such legislation is the major difficulty facing our immigration services or our immigrant community. New legislation is not a prerequisite for building on the policies already in place. I consider it important to draw a distinction between immigration policies, which are the prerogative of the Government of the day, on the one hand, and the legislative framework through which such policies are implemented, on the other. New immigration laws do not necessarily mean new policies and the converse applies, new immigration policies do not necessarily mean new laws. Neither is it true that immigration policy cannot develop in the absence of new legislation. An interesting case in point is the Refugee Act, which was enacted in its original form in 1996, but could not be commenced until a further amendment four years later. The reason was that the reality on the ground and the policies necessary to cope with this had changed and the Act as originally passed was unworkable. Postponing the commencement of that Act until it could be suitably amended did not prevent the implementation, in the meantime, of an administrative scheme to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s proactive policy in the area.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that immigration and citizenship policy should be an expression of Ireland&rsquo;s national values both at home and throughout the world. Our policies in these areas are a significant part of the dynamic process of shaping Ireland&rsquo;s future. If managed properly inward migration can bring very considerable benefits to the State, as we have seen in recent years, including improvements in economic growth and productivity, as well as cultural enrichment and diversity. However, the proper management of these matters includes having an orderly, organised and enforceable system of entry. I do not accept the proposition that there is no immigration policy. In one sense, this is a <Col N="58"/>charge that is easy to make and difficult to counter. The fact is, however, that people come to Ireland from a wide variety of social and economic backgrounds, for different purposes and various lengths of time. I do not accept that all such persons may be neatly pigeon-holed or that they can be treated as a separate generic group. In many instances their needs have more in common with Irish citizens of a similar socio-economic background than with other categories of non-national. It is not possible to have a definitive policy which is tailored precisely to each individual situation, but it is essential to have a coherent overview of the whole system. All too often, however, many people take the unique circumstances of an unusual individual case, and without knowing all the facts use it as evidence of the lack of coherence in the overall scheme.</P>
      <P>Here is an example of the reality on the ground. In 2003 there were more than 127,000 non-European economic area nationals registered with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as legally resident in the State. This figure covers those who were legally resident for more than three months at any time during that year. It excludes asylum applicants and children under 16, as well as the female spouses of Irish nationals, although that anachronism has since been amended. It also represents a fourfold increase over the corresponding period in 1999. Therefore, the number of people registered in this State from the non-EEA countries had grown by four times in the period 1999-2003.</P>
      <P>This large increase posed significant challenges for the immigration administrative system and for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular. However, the sheer scale of the numbers is hardly evidence of the absence of a policy on immigration or of one that ignores the benefits that immigrants bring to a country such as ours, rather the contrary. For example, more than 34,000 of those were entitled by virtue of their immigration conditions to work without any employment permit. A further 28,000 were students who were entitled to work part-time without an employment permit. In fact 62,000 of those non-EEA nationals were entitled to work without any formal employment permit. Despite this, there is a mistaken perception that every non-EEA national working in the State is, in fact, subject to the employment permit scheme.</P>
      <P>These exemptions are not accidental. They are there because it is part of Government&rsquo;s immigration policy that those categories should not have to have employment permits. In addition, the admission of ten new member states to the European Union removed the employment permit requirement for their nationals with effect from 1 May 2004. This approach, another aspect of this Government&rsquo;s immigration policy, is far more generous than in some of the other member states of the European Union. It was an example <Col N="59"/>of policy being worked out in practice. We said, &ldquo;No permits, on you go&rdquo;. It is liberal in absolute terms as well as in comparison to the approach of some of our European neighbours. As a result of the policy, over 15,000 people who were the subject of employment permits in 2003, or one third of the total, were exempt from the requirement from 1 May onwards.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the need for infrastructural development within our immigration service in terms of computerisation and the like. A great deal of rapid progress has been made in recent years. All major Garda registration offices have been computerised and the standard of service provision improved dramatically in the last two years. The long queues which were once a feature of the Garda registration office in Harcourt Street are now a thing of the past. Some 650 civil servants are employed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with immigration related matters. It must be borne in mind that 70% of these staff members are engaged in the processing of asylum claims or in the provision of accommodation for the small minority of non-nationals in the State who are asylum applicants.</P>
      <P>The major reduction in the number of asylum applicants has provided me with some elbow room and the opportunity to refocus some of these significant public resources on areas of service provision for non-nationals which are under-resourced at this point in time. The freeing up of resources will benefit further the provision of services to the remainder of our immigrant community and, perhaps, help to alleviate the false perception that a policy lacuna exists. There can be no question of the Government doing other than honour its commitments to the 1951 convention as a fundamental expression of our humanitarian ideals notwithstanding the fact that to do so costs the taxpayer approximately &euro;350 million per annum.</P>
      <P>It is in the nature of our work as Deputies that people come to us whenever they have problems. There is, accordingly, a danger that our perception of immigration matters, to name but one aspect of the Government&rsquo;s many functions, may be coloured by the fact that these are all we see. While people come to us about visa matters only when there is a refusal, we should also be aware of the many thousands of visas issued every year in contrast to those which are refused. The House should bear in mind that in 2003, 122,000 visa applications were granted and 21,000 refused. This is a six to one ratio. Likewise, while public representatives know all about those cases which involve a proposal to deport, we must also be aware of the many thousands whose permissions to be in the State are granted or renewed as a matter of course. Each of these represents the <Col N="60"/>implementation of a Government immigration policy.</P>
      <P>It is easy to make the college debating society crack that the Immigration Act 1999 was a deportation rather than an immigration measure. While this cheap jibe may form the basis for a sound bite which receives media coverage, every instance of immigration policy is characterised by rules in accordance with which some people are permitted to remain in the State and others are not. This is true in every state in every part of the world. The absence of deportation divisions would mean there was no immigration policy at all. Deportation is therefore one of the core essentials of any immigration policy. If one does not have deportation at the heart of an immigration policy, one will have chaos.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there are inadequacies in current immigration law. It is because I accept this fact that I will issue the discussion document and bring forward the comprehensive immigration and residence Bill next year. I do not accept, however, that a consequence of this Bill&rsquo;s absence has been a failure to develop immigration policy. Among other things, Deputy Costello suggested in his contribution that there is no Government policy on asylum, which is a rather odd suggestion given the evidence at every hand&rsquo;s turn of a proactive one. The policy has been in place and evolving ever since my predecessor, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, was in office. Its first element is the overarching principle of firm commitment to protecting those who need the State&rsquo;s protection and to the 1951 convention on refugees. In keeping with that principle, we aim to ensure that every person who comes to Ireland in genuine need of the State&rsquo;s protection from state prosecution is recognised as a refugee at the earliest possible stage.</P>
      <P>The practical out-working dictated by this commitment means a number of features are now in place. There is a workable statutory framework for dealing objectively and independently with claims for protection which was not provided for in the original incarnation of the Refugee Act 1996. In fact, the structures originally provided for in the Act could not have coped with the volume of asylum claims which were experienced within a few short months of its enactment. There has been significant investment in staff and other resources to ensure the Refugee Act works. Staff have been provided for the independent bodies themselves as have staff and funding for legal aid services to assist asylum seekers in making their claims. Staff have been provided in my Department to deal with the decisions of the independent bodies on asylum claims. There has been significant State investment in the provision of services to asylum seekers while their cases are being investigated and determined by the independent bodies. The Reception and Integration Agency of my Department has a network of <Col N="61"/>facilities which provide a wide range of services for this cohort of persons throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It would be a cause of considerable personal satisfaction if the results of the work of the independent bodies involved the processing of a high proportion of valid claims as this would indicate that most claims for protection were well founded. I do not worry about large numbers of genuine refugees as we have committed to protecting those who need protection and will deliver willingly on the commitment. However, the House must acknowledge that what is dismaying about asylum numbers is not the volume of well founded claims or even claims themselves but the high proportion which turn out not to be well founded. More than nine out of ten fall into this latter category after independent investigation and appeal. Among other things, this statistic means the resources the State invests in the asylum process turn out in large measure to be wasted when they could be used to improve access to more efficient and productive aspects of the immigration and citizenship processes.</P>
      <P>This leads me to the next leg of asylum policy which is an equal commitment to remove from the State those who claim protection whose claims turn out to be groundless. Without this policy our commitment to protecting those in genuine need would be wide open to abuse and we might as well not bother with our asylum policy&rsquo;s other core elements. It must be acknowledged that false claims for asylum and those who make them have a number of adverse effects apart altogether from merely financial ones. Most seriously, a high incidence of false claims brings the precious institution of refugee status into disrepute particularly when coupled with sloppy journalistic or non-governmental organisation language which seeks to equate all asylum seekers with refugees. False claims diminish public awareness of the fact that most non-nationals in Ireland are people who have come here in compliance with normal immigration requirements, have nothing to do with the asylum process and ensure their stay is lawful.</P>
      <P>I have noted a tendency to accept uncritically as true every charge against the decisions of the refugee process. The result is pickets outside my Department and the office of my party while people say I am engaged in racist deportations. While I do not want to get involved in discussions of individual examples, when one considers some of these cases, one finds there is no truth whatsoever in the underlying allegations made by those who say I acted appallingly in refusing their claims. It is not I who assess their claims. Claims are assessed in a two way process carried out by independent people. I ask the House to accept the proposition that those involved in the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal legs of the asylum process do their best to distinguish between true and untrue <Col N="62"/>claims of persecution. While it may be that where an appeal is rejected two mistakes have been made, it is much more likely that both objective processes have reached the correct conclusion that the continued claim of persecution is unfounded. I have found it disturbing, to put it no stronger, that a number of public personages have sided with someone who has made wild and unfounded claims against the asylum process which have evaporated completely when tested in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>How does that equate with the fact that a great proportion of appeals by applicants are successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The point was made that it was somehow unfair to place the onus on the applicant. Of course, the onus must lie on the applicant as Ireland cannot prove or disprove claims which are simply suggested as possibilities to be shot down. The fact that there is a significant rate of success on appeal cuts both ways. If almost every appeal was rejected I would be told it was a rubber stamp process by a group of people who were inhumane and not doing their job. That charge is made fairly frequently. The success or non-success rate, at first instance, of an appeal is what good well-intentioned people, who try to be objective, bring about as the outcome of their work. Given the broad range of people involved in the process, the truth is, as Deputy Costello knows, there have been many cases where there has been a colossal hullabaloo about a particular person. Afterwards it turns out that there was no truth whatsoever in the underlining allegations that had been made.</P>
      <P>The deportation process which follows is described as racist. By implication, the Department and all the independent institutions which arrived at that decision are, at least, branded as uncaring and cruel. On many of these occasions people have been found to be telling gross untruths to willing listeners who have not had any respect for the fact that two separate processes have looked at whether the complaint was true or false.</P>
      <P>We have a very generous system of appeals that allows the appellant to introduce new evidence on the appeal which he or she did not introduce at first instance. That would explain different decisions. We could run a system whereby if it was not mentioned on the first day, one should not bother to mention it later. We have a system that allows a person to put any information they have on the table on the second day even if they did not put it on the table on the first day. That explains the reason there is a difference in outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Deputies referred to the situations of persons awaiting decisions on applications for residence on the basis of an Irish-born child. These cases comprise approximately 11,000 persons who made application prior to 19 <?oasys _dc20-?>February 2003 to remain in the State on that basis. Of course, there are thousands of others who made no application prior to that date but who are here now. To put some context on the response to this point it is necessary to refer back to the Government&rsquo;s decision to hold a referendum on citizenship rights of Irish-born children, a decision which was pilloried in some quarters. One reason advanced by those who opposed the referendum was that the numbers involved were exaggerated and that I was creating a big row about a handful of cases. It is ironic that the focus of debate is on the position of approximately 11,000 non-nationals who asked to remain in the State on the basis of having an Irish-born child. Such a figure is not a handful in anybody&rsquo;s arithmetic.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>It is wrong to say that the policy of the Government following the outcome of the L &amp;  O judgment by the Supreme Court was to deport the parents of Irish-born children as a matter of administrative routine. The Supreme Court judgment specifically forbids such an approach. The position in regard to these cases was set out by Mr. Justice Hardiman in the Supreme Court in the L &amp;  O case. I shall quote his words, because sometimes they appear to be forgotten in the heat of battle. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It seems to me that the existence of an Irish-born child does not fundamentally transform the right to the parents, though it requires the specific consideration of the Minister, who must reasonably be satisfied of the existence of a grave and substantial reason favouring deportation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Recently at Question Time, in the cut and thrust of debate, I used the phrase &ldquo;the number of occasions where I have directed a parent to bring his or her child out of Ireland is infinitesimal as a percentage of the figures&rdquo; and some adverse construction has been put on it. I want to correct that. I have never directed the parents of an Irish-born child to take their child out of Ireland with them, nor could I because that is a choice which the Irish law confers on them and on them alone. I cannot direct the parents of an Irish-born child, who is an Irish citizen, to take that child out of Ireland. What I can do is direct that the parents themselves be deported and then they have a choice. What I meant to say, and I want to make this clear now in case anybody is drawing some other conclusion, was that the number of occasions on which I have directed parents, who are the parents of an Irish-born child, to leave the country is infinitesimal by comparison with the number of cases where deportation has taken place.</P>

	<P>Is that in regard to the 37 Irish-born babies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of 37 Irish-born children I gave a direction that the parents should leave. I believe that in those 37 cases, the great majority of those parents did the natural thing and brought their children with them. I am not in a position, as I said on the last occasion, to say whether any of them decided it was in the interest of their child to leave the child behind them in Ireland and to go abroad. I cannot give figures on that. What I am saying is that the number of occasions, since coming to office, on which I have directed parents who are the parents of an Irish-born child to leave the country &mdash; in the great majority of cases they have taken their child with them &mdash; has been 37, which is infinitesimal compared with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correcting the record in regard to Irish-born children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice that Deputy Costello&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>They are no longer breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to let me finish. I notice that Deputy Costello leapt on my suggestion that I was directing people to bring their Irish-born children out of Ireland. I have never directed any parents to bring an Irish-born child, who is an Irish citizen, out of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We thought that because the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am correcting that now. It is clear from what Mr. Justice Hardiman said that each of these cases must receive a rigorous and intensive scrutiny with a view to ensuring the principles set out in the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment are complied with. As a consequence, this is necessarily more consuming than if the child was not an Irish citizen. The constitutional rights of the child within the family unit must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The issue of <i>refoulement</i> as set out in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 must also be taken into account, as must 11 separate considerations which are set out in statutory form in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999. These grounds include duration of residence in the State, humanitarian considerations and consideration of the common good. Every case is brought to my office and each receives a personal decision by me. The ultimate decision in any case where deportation is contemplated is made by me. While I rely on advice I receive and I do not reopen the whole case in its <Col N="65"/>entirety, it is not some process in which the decision is made by others entirely.</P>
      <P>We are faced with the outcome of the Chen judgment and we now know that the European Court of Justice has determined in the Chen case and ruled in favour of Mrs. Chen. The European Court of Justice upheld the right of Mrs. Chen to deliberately engineer a situation in which her child would acquire Irish citizenship through birth in Northern Ireland in order to secure long-term residence for both herself and her child in the United Kingdom. During the course of this debate Deputy Costello has identified the contrast with the situation of non-national parents of Irish-born children who are entitled, as a result of the Chen judgment, to reside as of right in the United Kingdom but are not entitled to reside in Ireland. That is an issue to which I drew the attention of the public shortly after the Advocate General&rsquo;s opinion was published. At that time I said this had some long-term consequences. At that time also, Deputy Costello took the opposite view stating that the effects of Chen judgment on the Irish situation were minimal.</P>
      <P>The implications of the Chen judgment are being studied by my officials in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and today I have received advice from the Attorney General on them. I will need some time to absorb that advice. Those who accused me of rushing to judgment on the referendum issue would do well to heed their own advice in this instance given that the judgment was handed down only a couple of weeks ago. The Chen case outcome underlines the necessity for the referendum and of this Bill. When the Bill is enacted and implemented the issue that the Chen case typified will not arise again.</P>
      <P>I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage which will include a provision to standardise the form of declaration required under the Act and to create an offence for deliberately or recklessly making a false declaration; a provision to apply the criteria for reckonable residence in section 4 to section 16(<i>a</i>) of the 1956 Act, which deals with reckonable residence for naturalisation purposes, in order to provide a uniform approach to the calculation of periods of reckonable residence under our citizenship law; and a provision to broaden the scope of section 11 of the 1956 Act to ensure that foreign adoptions recognised under Irish law will also serve to confer Irish citizenship where one of the adopters is Irish and some other technical amendments.</P>
      <P>In addition, the side note to section 11 which does not fully reflect the provisions of the section will be amended. As the note does not form part of the content of the Bill, there is no need to table a formal amendment on Committee Stage, but the next print of the Bill will contain an amended side note.</P><Col N="66"/>
      <P>I will consider with an open mind any amendments Deputies opposite may table with a view to accepting any such amendments that are consistent with the policy of the Government and the understanding created by it in the minds of the people at the time of the referendum debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore brought to my attention a particular case in the course of this debate. The facts he cited did require an intervention. As a result, a visa will be granted following a review of the case.</P>
      <P>As recently as seven or eight years ago, this country had little experience of economic inward migration. It had a small market for immigration and the administrative measures it had in place reflected a paucity of interest therein. The country&rsquo;s resources were limited in the extent to which they controlled migration and a handful of officials and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dealt with a problem that was of small proportions. In the intervening period circumstances changed dramatically and for the better economically. Consequently, a great number wanted to come here to participate in building our economic wealth and the life of our society and to better their personal fortunes and those of the families they had left behind. I firmly believe Ireland&rsquo;s success is built in considerable measure on the efforts of these immigrants. Even if we were to approach the issue from an entirely selfish point of view, which I do not, we would conclude that it would be economic folly, to put it at its lowest, to show a cold face towards immigration and resist the interest of those in working in Ireland and participating in its society.</P>
      <P>These facts should not blind us to other realities. Our system of protection for refugees has become elaborate and entails the absorption of considerable administrative and economic resources. The flow of asylum seekers into Ireland was substantial but has decreased substantially in recent times because of a number of developments, not least the legislative measures I have put in place since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These measures, combined with improved administration, have meant that asylum decisions, especially those pertaining to priority cases, are now frequently available in a matter of weeks and that appeals thereto are determined in a matter of weeks thereafter. What once must have appeared to my predecessor, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, as a major crisis is now under control. The measures that have been put in place are adequate to deal with the problems asylum seeking has created for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Having said this, the House should be aware of some fundamental truths. Those fleeing persecution in some countries &mdash; I will not be specific as we are all intelligent people &mdash; are not the poor, huddled masses but in the main people with considerable resources at their disposal who are <Col N="67"/>coming to Ireland to jump the queue and effectively establish for themselves residence on the basis of economic migrancy under the guise of asylum seeking. We would be foolish and dishonest intellectually if we were to pretend the asylum seeking route into Ireland has not been used with this in mind by many, but by no means all, considering that our citizenship law meant, even given the L &amp;  O case which eventually came to the aid of the State in this matter, that the birth of an Irish child to such migrants created a new set of circumstances that was difficult for the State to handle.</P>
      <P>As a people, we have decided by an overwhelming majority in a referendum that we do not believe the mere accident of birth in Ireland should be the sole criterion in determining Irish citizenship. We have decided that there must be a more tangible and long-term link between the parent of the child before citizenship, as of right, becomes available. In this respect, we have decided to revert to the constitutional position before the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. We have decided to restore to the Houses of the Oireachtas the power to judge collectively, by legislation, whether there is a sufficient link between a parent and Ireland as a State and a community to warrant the granting of citizenship to the children of that parent. The people were told at the time of the referendum the broad thrust of the Government policy that was to follow upon the licence to legislate in this area that the passing of that referendum would give. What is being put before this House is a realistic and sensible policy based on the establishment of a real link between parents of children born in Ireland and the State and society.</P>
      <P>We could have retained the absolute <i>jus soli</i> principle which obtained on a constitutional rather than a statutory basis from 1999 to 2004. However, we are in a different position from countries that have this system in place. It has been said repeatedly in the course of this debate that the United States has a system of <i>jus soli</i> to this day. However, the United States is not a member of a community of countries that allows people to enter its borders without any immigration formalities. If the United States was part of a common travel area with countries from which people could gain access to it without such formalities, the whole system of <i>jus soli</i> would probably come into sharp focus in American political debate. Whether this is the case, the United States is in a different position. It does not have the jurisprudence enunciated by Mr. Justice Hardiman in the L &amp;  O case, to which I made reference. It is not the case that by having a child in the United States the parents of that child can remain in that country according to the same criteria under which they would be entitled to remain in Ireland as a matter of constitutional <Col N="68"/>law. Therefore, comparisons between Ireland and the United States are wide of the mark.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated in his careful speech that what we had done had breached international convenants on the rights of children. In particular, he focused on the rights of access of parents to children and children to their families. He suggested that by having a law in Ireland which denies <i>jus soli</i> citizenship, and which can in some circumstances require parents of Irish born children to leave the country, we are in breach of the provisions of international law. This view was articulated by the Commission on Human Rights in a slightly vague form during the referendum debate. If that were so, the great majority of European Union member states would equally be in the same position, which I reject. I do not accept this is an acceptable point of view. I do not believe that by bringing our law roughly into line with those of other EU member states means we are in breach of any international obligations. I do not believe the argument to that effect, articulated by the Human Rights Commission during the referendum debate, stood up to scrutiny. I regret to say this about the commission&rsquo;s arguments because I normally pay very close attention to what it says. On this occasion I paid very close attention to its arguments which I found completely unconvincing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins queried my description of what happened within the Labour Party in regard to this matter. I was relying on the printed word of one journal to the effect that Deputy Rabbitte initially supported the idea of the Government referendum but that he was out-voted by the remainder of his party. I assumed Deputy Higgins was among these members.</P>

    <Title>Road Traffic Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never had the privilege of addressing such a full Chamber but it is fading away quickly. I addressed my previous comments to general aspects of the Bill and now want to refer to more specific aspects.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with speed limits. One change I propose concerns the duty to consult other bodies. There is a duty to consult the Garda and the town council, if there is one. I suggest that an amendment be proposed to ensure there is a duty to consult neighbouring county councils or local authorities generally. We have had a problem in my county council area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, with roads contiguous to Dublin City Council areas where speed limits change at the local authority border. This makes no sense. The problem would be obviated if local authorities were obliged to consult neighbouring authorities when setting speed limits.</P>
      <P>Section 9(6) deals with different speed limits on the same road and carriageway at different times. This has something to do with quality bus corridors. The local authorities in my area, in which there are many quality bus corridors, want to be able to create a lower speed limit in the bus corridor to the one that applies on the main part of the carriageway. For example, on the N11 this would mean that cars could drive at the normal 60 kph on the carriageway while traffic in the quality bus corridor would observe a 50 kph limit. This would make sense because the bus corridor is generally adjacent to a cycle lane or pathway used by pedestrians. It would be of benefit to drive at a slower speed. This subsection is, therefore, welcome.</P>
      <P>On the issue of speed limits, I do not want to sound like a flat-earther, but we licence cars that can travel faster than 120 km per hour. If it will always be illegal to travel faster than 120 km per hour when this Bill becomes law, is it right to licence vehicles that can go faster? Perhaps this is a matter that could be dealt with in the future. It cannot be dealt with in this Bill. However, some cars being sold today are capable of travelling at enormous speeds. It is incredible, pointless and will always be illegal to travel at such speeds. Perhaps the introduction of some kind of damper could be considered at a later stage. That being said, those speeds are not always the most dangerous. A speed limit of 50 miles per hour in a built-up area can be equally lethal.</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with roadworks. I am pleased with this section because there is a problem on the N11 where there is a 30 miles per hour speed limit. The N11 is a dual carriageway running from Dublin to Wexford. There is a 30 miles per hour speed limit because the NRA and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council cannot agree on a speed limit. Therefore, the 30 miles <Col N="72"/>per hour speed limit remains for no good reason. I have it on anecdotal authority only that residents are worried that garda&iacute; are sitting in ambush and giving motorists penalty points for going faster than 30 miles per hour on a dual carriageway. That is not sensible. Section 10 allows the local authority to revoke the speed limit. I am glad this is being done because it is not right that it should take so long or that it should have to go through a public consultation process or anything of that order.</P>
      <P>There are other problems that need to be dealt with. One relates to road maintenance. Again, I refer to a local problem. Seapoint Road, which becomes Crofton Road, and Monkstown Road are parallel roads that feed into D&uacute;n Laoghaire. There are roadworks on both roads. It is not rocket science to work out this should not happen. As a result, the roadworks at Crofton Road are being carried out at night and the residents are very annoyed about it. Surely some legislative provision could be introduced to ensure road closures do not occur at the same on roads that feed into the same area. It does not make sense. When there is so little space and so much traffic it seems a very bad decision. I am aware it is a management decision and not affected by the proposals we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill as the latest legislation in a sequence which will support the road safety strategy. While the main content is to facilitate the introduction of metric speed limits, the Bill offers an opportunity to reflect on road use and practice. There are four areas with which I wish to deal, namely, signage, the administration of the penalty points system, resourcing and a few additional measures that may enhance the Bill if the Minister would consider them.</P>
      <P>On the first point, consistency and clarity should be the hallmarks of any signage system. As matters stand, only an Irish person could understand our signage system with its unique blend of the metric and the imperial. It is hoped this confusion will be addressed. However, it will be some time before all speed limit signs throughout the country are replaced. The directional signs also need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Bill deals with the transitional arrangements for the introduction of metric speed limits. The Minister stated the process of metrication would be completed by 20 January next year. During the transitional phase, signs which will have some relevance in this period will indicate speeds of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 and 120 kilometres or miles per hour. This will be very difficult for the hard-pressed motorist to comprehend. The opportunities for confusion are legion. It will not be clear to the driver whether the signs refer to kilometres or miles per hour.</P>
      <P>Speed limits also need to be consistent and reasonable. Measures within the Bill to remove the general speed limit and apply a limit that relates to the standard of the road are to be commended. Speed limits need to be reasonable and <Col N="73"/>appropriate in order that most drivers will observe them. I am particularly conscious of the ring road outside Galway where there is a 30 miles per hour speed limit. It is crazy because the road is of a high standard and the 30 miles per hour speed limit causes great annoyance and frustration. It is a road where there will now be a reasonable speed limit. Having speed limits such as some of the ones we have at present does no good in terms of compliance.</P>
      <P>Section 17 of the Bill is welcome. It allows for the outsourcing of the administration of the penalty points system to persons other than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will free up valuable Garda time from administrative duties in order that garda&iacute; may be deployed on duties requiring their skills.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system has had the potential to change driving behaviour. The extent of this is evidenced by the figures relating to accident fatalities and hospital admissions for spinal cord injuries which plummeted in the period after the introduction of the system. There were 84 fatalities in the first four months under the penalty points system, compared to a previous monthly average of 39. The number of admissions for spinal cord injuries was down 50% in this period. Regrettably, this good start has not been sustained. We must ask why. Enforcement is probably at the heart of it. The level of compliance was high following the introduction of the penalty points system because most of us perceived that detection and prosecution were a real and present possibility. If properly resourced with both technology and a dedicated traffic corps, the road safety strategy will be able to achieve its target of reducing fatality levels from a current average of 32 per month to 25.</P>
      <P>Additional measures which the Minister may like to consider including in the Bill are flashing amber lights permitting drivers to turn left on a red light. This measure is in operation in America and could very easily be introduced here. It would facilitate a freer flow of traffic. I am glad the Minister is here. I suggest that he take a detour on his journey home and, at the Wyattville junction, turn into the Wyattville Park area where he will find out what the residents have to put up with. In a short distance there is a sequence of five traffic lights which are not in sequence with each other. If one turns into Wyattville Drive and Wyattville Park, in trying to get out again one is stuck for a considerable period of time at a red light because there are five lights that need to be considered. This causes ferocious frustration. If there was a flashing amber light to permit left turns, it would facilitate the free movement of traffic. The example in Wyattville is a good one and I am sure there are many more throughout the country where the introduction of such a system might be advantageous.</P>
      <P>Another measure I would like to see introduced, to which my constituency colleague also referred, is the outlawing of 24 hour bus lanes. I <Col N="74"/>cannot conceive of any necessity to have bus lanes freed up on a 24 hour basis. On the Minister&rsquo;s journey home via the N11 he will be able to observe the difficulties for himself. The Stillorgan quality bus corridor has been a magnificent success and its extension is to be welcomed. Its one shortcoming is that, although the regulations permit one to use the bus lane from 7 p.m. as far as Foxrock Church which is perfectly adequate after the rush hour when sometimes there is still a lot of traffic on the road, if one proceeds beyond the junction at Foxrock Church, one is then subject to a 24 hour bus lane. If we ask motorists to comply with the regulations, we must have an understanding of consistency. However, the Minister should not get the notion that we are looking for a 24 hour bus lane on the rest of the N11, we are not. I believe he is a practical man who understands it is the taxpayers, through motor tax and many other means, who fund the roads and are entitled to use them. The question of a 24 hour bus lane should be extinguished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it is the case that roads with three lanes have 24 hour bus lanes and those with two lanes have 12 hour bus lanes. However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the road has now been widened sufficiently to accommodate three lanes. This is an issue the Minister might consider as it is a new area.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Andrews, mentioned the conditions of roads and the commitment which is placed on local authorities in this regard. We are always focusing our attention on how the behaviour of motorists can be changed. Standards must be imposed but the condition of the infrastructure is also an important issue. Of particular concern in this regard are areas where roadworks are taking place and the importance of maintenance in terms of keeping cones and signage clear and illuminated. The standards in keeping these traffic calming measures tidy and highly visible are frequently questionable. An example is that of Moate in the midlands where bollards that are in place are frequently filthy. It is an agricultural area so one should expect agricultural traffic. This traffic produces a significant amount of dirt, however, and numerous people have had accidents there by banging into or crossing over the bollards and other traffic calming measures.</P>
      <P>Many constituents have spoken to me about the need for a standardisation of ramps. There are ramps of different standards throughout the country and in different areas within County Dublin. This matter may not suitably be included in the provisions of this Bill, but some type of regulation is required. It would be easier for the local authorities if they had guidance in terms of a minimum requirement, for example. The ramps in one area in my constituency have small glides which allow cars to gently glide over the ramps. Ramps in other areas, however, impact severely <Col N="75"/>on the bottom of cars and I am sure the council is facing many claims as a result of this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as one element of the measures which the Minister will bring forward in terms of the road strategy Bill. We must be more determined with regard to the budgeting for the road strategy Bill and in ensuring the recognition on the part of the Department of Finance in particular that securing adequate resources for the implementation of the strategy and the imposition of standards, especially in terms of detection and the introduction of technology for the penalty points system, is in all our interests. There will be a saving with regard to health care. The statistics speak for themselves in terms of that very good period at the introduction of the penalty points system and the diminished number of spinal cord injuries. The Department of Finance must recognise its responsibility in making other Departments recognise that they should provide some of the budget for the road strategy and that it is not just a matter for the Department of Transport. The Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have particular requirements in this area. If the road strategy is properly resourced and implemented, lower fatality figures can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a general consensus among most of the Deputies to whom I have spoken that the provisions of the Bill are necessary. Whether it goes far enough is another question. Irrespective of the region in which one lives, whether built-up urban areas or sparsely populated rural areas, the issue of speeding, drunken driving and the entire driving culture is on everybody&rsquo;s lips.</P>
      <P>Regarding speed limits, it is the correct approach to convert to metric. I have no difficulty with the Bill&rsquo;s proposal regarding the maximum limit, which is fair and reasonable. Something the Minister should be careful about, however, is the issue of dovetailing the speed limit to the standard of the road. This is a very important issue. I am not sure whether it is the Minister&rsquo;s Department, the NRA or the local authorities which will have the final say in this matter. Deputy Andrews mentioned the importance of consistency across county boundaries. It would not do, for example, that when one comes to the county boundary at Mount Talbot between counties Galway and Roscommon, that there should be two different speed limits within a distance of five yards. This should never happen at any county boundaries.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his predecessor on another matter which I have always believed was important to implement. This is to put some type of speed limit on the smaller roads, whether they be called county roads or regional roads. There is a unique situation in this country whereby one can travel at 50, 60 or 70 mph on certain roads but can travel legally at 100 mph on some other roads. There was nothing to stop one <Col N="76"/>travelling at such a speed because those roads have never been checked as such. The major difficulty with imposing a speed limit on roads of this description is that the resources must be there to police that limit. This is the most significant trouble I have observed over the years regarding this issue. Irrespective of which parties are in Government, there must be a much greater degree of policing for this strategy to work. I do not know how this will be handled, whether through a beefed-up traffic corps or a much greater use of speed cameras.</P>
      <P>I hope that while all this is in train there will be a culture change whereby people will simply no longer want to drive in a reckless fashion. As several of my colleagues observed, every time a new model of car is introduced to the market, it seems the greatest selling point is its capacity to go from zero to 70, 80 or 100 mph in a few seconds. This is apparently what appeals to the purchasing public. I am not sure if anything can be done about this, be it in terms of legislation or good sense, because it is a matter of technology improving from one year to the next. It is difficult for a driver who has shelled out &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 for a new car which could perform a lap of honour around Mondello Park to keep his or her foot off the accelerator. Cars are getting larger and more sophisticated and can go from a standing start much faster than they ever did before.</P>
      <P>I notice, as I am sure the Minister does in his own area, that many constituents say they are taking their lives in their hands when attempting to cross the road in their own small village or hamlet. I was recently approached by a woman in a very small village in south County Galway called Killimor, who told me that she blesses herself every day when crossing the road. There is a 30 mph speed limit in this village but nobody seems to take any notice of it. Another example is the small village of Kilrickle on the N6 between Ballinasloe and Loughrea.</P>
      <P>Something will have to be done to ensure the lives of local people are protected as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Another story is doing the rounds, in respect of which the Minister might outline the factual position. In consultation with the local authorities and the Garda, during the years speed limit signs have been placed at strategic places outside towns and villages. Any of us who were members of county councils or corporations know there was more to the placing of the speed limit sign than the protection of pedestrians, including children; it gave people more than half a right, so to speak, to planning permission for a development inside the speed limit sign. That is the way the issue of planning was handled.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that there is a proposal by the National Roads Authority that when the speed limits signs are rejigged, some of them be placed closer to the centre of villages. I am referring to major roads in certain <Col N="77"/>areas of the country, including some in County Galway. Is this the Minister&rsquo;s doing, the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s proposal or a proposal by the local county council which I do not think is the case?</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the National Roads Authority has a policy that if one drives from Dublin to Waterford or from Dublin to Galway, one should be able to arrive in reasonable comfort under normal driving conditions in X number of hours and minutes to facilitate the commercial life of the nation, but these target times must be counter-balanced. It is one thing to drive from Dublin to Galway in three hours but another to ensure a child is not hurt on the journey. It is against this background that a good deal of thought will have to be given to this matter before speed limit signs are placed nearer to the centre of towns and villages. If the area covered by such speed limit signs in town and villages is reduced, a mechanism, whether flashing lights or improved signage, will have to be used.</P>
      <P>Many residents associations, chambers of commerce and town development associations will be up in arms about this proposal. I wanted to bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention which I am sure he has heard raised on many previous occasions. However, it is no harm to reinforce this point of view. From a safety perspective, I hope there will not be much changing in the placing of signs, or if that is what is proposed, the reason for it will be explained and, more importantly, an alternative mechanism will be put in place.</P>
      <P>Many colleagues mentioned the question of consistency of speed limits. There is no greater inconsistency than on the N6 from Dublin to Maynooth. There are no fewer than five speed limits on that short stretch of road. There are speed limits of 30 mph, 40 mph, 50 mph, 60 mph and 70 mph. There are occasions when one finds oneself in a zone where one is not sure exactly what the speed limit is. I incurred two penalty points travelling along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is speaking from first-hand experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought I was travelling in a 60 mph zone and was travelling at 54 mph, but incurred two penalty points as I was travelling in a 50 mph zone. Needless to say, when I travel on that part of that road again, I will know what zone I am in. One hopes that under the new speed limit regime, the signage used will be rationalised. I am not making a case about that incident as I was breaking the law. All I am doing is pointing out that this matter is worthy of note.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Malley raised a issue on the other side of the coin. She referred to a road in Galway city, the Tuam road leading to the first roundabout near the Menlo Hotel. It is as good a road as one would find anywhere in the country. It is one of the ring roads in Galway of which we are extremely proud but it is in a 30 mph zone. One must travel so slow that one would nearly think <Col N="78"/>one&rsquo;s car had gone into reverse. I am not an expert on road safety or the calculation of speed limits appropriate to particular road surfaces but the speed limit on that stretch of road does not serve the travelling public. I hope the powers that be will review it because the road could accommodate a faster speed limit, perhaps 10 mph higher. I cannot graphically get this point across, but if the Minister was to travel on this road, he would know what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>In regard to the penalty points system, I note the Minister proposes to replace Garda manpower. I take it this will occur on the administration side and that there will not be lay people manning a speed camera or speed trap. I take it the Minister is giving an undertaking this will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is not included in the Bill. It only deals with the administration side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that change because I assume the thinking is that there will be more garda&iacute; available to police traffic. The Minister might indicate how many garda&iacute; will be involved in this activity. Will it be a token number or will it involve a considerable number? Will it be ten, 20 or 100, or does the Minister know the number?</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention a regional matter related to the Bill. I saw him in his great splendour last night on television as he opened the Monasterevin bypass. Good luck to Monasterevin and the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless we do something about the matter, that is the way we will be left. It is nothing short of shameful that despite the area being included in the BMW region and having Objective One status, the main roads westward are improved very slowly. This will become a major issue in the next few years. Those of us living in the west are as entitled to a road as good as anywhere else in the country. We will fight to <Col N="79"/>have them. We sincerely hope on this side of the House that we will have an opportunity to make sure this happens when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy and I have a good regional focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, except mine is not winning. We will have to switch jerseys.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the penalty points system. We must have stringent controls in place because of the awful carnage on our roads and the hardship and anxiety families suffer.</P>
      <P>I have a word of advice for the Minister. The former Minister for Transport was a lively spark. He seemed to introduce a new initiative every ten days but one wondered if he had a planned approach to what he would do afterwards and whether there was any substance to his initiatives. It is all very well to announce measures and there is always a public reaction for a short time afterwards. However, one must provide for the policing of the measure in place and persuade members of the public that they will be caught if they break the law, whether by drinking and driving, driving at excessive speed or failing to use safety belts. It has entered the psyche of the people that policing has not followed the many excellent proposals of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. If the new Minister for Transport is to be successful &mdash; I hope he is, for everyone&rsquo;s sake &mdash; it is important for members of the public to see that they will be caught if they break the law. Once they believe this they will adhere to the law, as happens in every other country. When one sees road accident numbers rising steadily, one must accept many members of the public believe they will not be caught. That will be the litmus test of whatever measures the Minister implements. The results we all want can only be achieved through enforcement of the law. We have sufficient laws. It is time for order. Accident figures rise every weekend and every quarter. One must assume many believe that with a little luck they will not be caught. I hope the Minister will succeed in enforcing this aspect of his road safety strategy. It has yet not happened.</P>
      <P>It appears it has been decided to put a central crash barrier in place on dual carriageways. I argued for this in the D&aacute;il some years ago and spoke to the National Roads Authority about it at the time. Will the motorway from Dublin to Galway have a central crash barrier? It is my understanding the NRA intends that a central barrier will be put in place on the road between Dublin and Kinnegad but not on the more westerly section of the road. It is important that a crash barrier is built now because if it is not, it will never be built.</P>
      <P>I hope the packages introduced by the Minister will save lives. Nevertheless, if he does not enforce the law, we will not make progress.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="80"/>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finneran.</P>
      <P>We all have a personal responsibility for road safety. Every family has been touched by death on the road. It is not someone else who will crash; it is us, if we do not drive carefully. We should make the changes required by this legislation quickly, safely and clearly and the public should be informed when, where and how it is happening.</P>
      <P>The road safety theme provides a general policy background and framework for this Bill. The central purpose of the Bill is the metrification of speed limit signs. This is inevitable and long overdue. It is another aspect of our increasing European identity. It is important that we take advantage of our European identity, especially from a worldwide tourism point of view. Many tourists from the rest of the world do not include Ireland in their visits to Europe. Ireland is not included on many tour itineraries which visit France, Italy and Great Britain. Many have commented on how for some time our speed limits are measured imperially while distances are measured metrically.</P>
      <P>The EU unit of measurement regulation of 2002, made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, requires that all speed limit signs display metric values. The Bill aims to ensure the regulation is in place in January 2005. From that date the display of imperial values on speed limit signs will have no legal basis. This will introduce faster and slower speed limits and be confusing for some time. The proposed value for the speed limit on national roads is 100 km. This represents an increase of two miles per hour over the current general speed limit of 60 miles per hour. On non-national roads a new proposal will see a new speed limit for the rural road network and a reduction of ten miles to 80 km per hour. In built up areas the application of a 50 km per hour limit is the equivalent of 31 miles per hour. This, essentially, is in line with the current built up area speed limit of 30 miles per hour. On motorways a new speed limit of 120 km per hour will be applied. This will be an increase of four miles per hour on the current limit of 70 miles per hour.</P>
      <P>Motorists will have to become familiar with the kilometre display on their speed clocks instead of the miles per hour display. Such a change will take time to get used to. However, Ireland has adapted to big changes before such as decimalisation and the introduction of the euro. We will get used to change on our roads. As part of a positive approach to the European Union, Ireland has sought to bring forward the metric system. As long ago as the 1970s, children began learning in terms of litres, grammes and kilometres. For a country often portrayed as conservative in nature, it is surprising that there has been no fundamental resistance to this process. Metrification began in France during the French <Col N="81"/>Revolution, although many of the revolutionary efforts were abandoned.</P>
      <P>When we talk about speed limits, we must talk about their constant breaking.</P>

	<P>This motion acknowledges all the hard work by doctors, nurses and other health care professionals in the North Eastern Health Board region. However, there has been a number of tragic events in the north east that the House should discuss because there is a need to restore patients&rsquo; confidence in what is happening in the North Eastern Health Board region and in many other health board areas. The Opposition is afraid that when the new health authorities come into place on 1 January 2005, they may have even less accountability to the House.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am calling on the Government to explain fully its intended role in the operation of the new health service executive. I also wish to see all stakeholders in the north east having a say in such future services. It is also intended to discuss the resourcing of the Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath hospital groups.</P>
        <P>In two months&rsquo; time, the North Eastern Health Board, like all other health boards, will cease to exist. My fear is that the transparency, accountability, value for money and the role that public representatives have as watchdogs of the health care system will disappear under an increasingly careless, arrogant and uncaring Government.</P>
        <P>Doctors, nurses, other health care workers, hospital administrations and local community groups have worked together to try to maintain health services without adequate Government funding. At one point or another, all these groups have endured attempts by the Government to blame them for these problems. Health board officials have been a particularly soft target for scapegoating since they cannot defend themselves in public. They are obliged to remain silent as <Col N="83"/>they are pilloried by members of the Government for the current Administration&rsquo;s failings.</P>
       <?oasys _dc20-?> <P>The manipulation of facts by spin-doctors was accepted by many in the community who felt they would never need health services. Now, however, everybody knows someone who is unhappy with the health services. The Government has failed totally during the past seven years and we are concerned and fearful that our families will be affected in the foreseeable future by the health crisis.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>By focusing this debate on the North Eastern Health Board we will try to deconstruct the myth that the Government cares about the health services. During a visit to three hospitals in the north east, I found everybody saying that it is a question of resources. That major issue in our health services was referred to repeatedly by nurses, administrators and others we met on that visit. The Government will have to face the fact that the health services are not properly resourced.</P>
        <P>If there are other difficulties &mdash; or inefficiencies as they are being described &mdash; and if millions can be saved from the health budget, then I would like to hear Government Deputies talking about that. They should indicate all the areas where millions can be saved. I do not want to hear a reiteration of what has been done since 1997. They should simply point out where this money can be saved. Every time there is a health crisis we get a knee-jerk response from the Government with Ministers indicating where money was spent. However, one of the last jobs undertaken by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, before he left that portfolio, was to announce an expenditure of &euro;85 million to commission &euro;400 million worth of hospitals and health centres that have been left idle for years.</P>
        <P>In a recent speech to her own supporters, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, continued this deception of the Irish people, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is fair to say also that we have not had the more widespread improvements that all might have expected from tripling health spending in our health services since 1997. This is because our health services are not nearly as efficient or effective as they could be in using this additional investment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a real kick in the teeth for nurses and hospital administrators who are trying to keep the health service going. I wish to focus on the two major issues to which the T&aacute;naiste has referred, namely spending and inefficiency. As regards spending, Ireland reached the EU average on what we call health spending in 2001. If we are to believe a recent ESRI report, 20% of the health budget is actually social welfare spending. If that is true, then we have never reached the EU average on health spending during the lifetime of the current Government. If that is so, it puts to rest the argument that the health service is well resourced. It has not been well resourced at any stage of the Government&rsquo;s term of office.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>Today, there are patients lying on trolleys in Cavan Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. They are too sick to contemplate why our accident and emergency crisis has become an all-year-round affair, when even four years ago it was simply a winter crisis. The number of patients on trolleys continues to grow every day. That is one statistic that has been increasing annually. At one time, 20 or 30 patients were in A &amp; E departments overnight, while the figures now exceed 150, with patients spending two or three nights on trolleys</P>
        <P>When Government Deputies reply to this motion, they should discuss the inefficiencies of the health system. They should indicate where the problems lie. I think many of the difficulties are due to a lack of focus and coherent Government policies. Government Deputies should also explain to taxpayers where their money is being wasted in the health services. I do not believe that is the major problem.</P>
        <P>Blatant mistakes have been made by the Government. Since 1997, for instance, up to 30 new statutory and non-statutory health service organisations have been established by the Government. Within seven years of their establishment, however, the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo; report recommended the disbandment of most of these statutory bodies. One of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s first jobs as Minister for Health and Children was to establish the Eastern Regional Health Authority and three new health boards. One of his last jobs in that portfolio was to disband the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three health boards he had previously established. This is a Monty Python approach to health policy.</P>
        <P>The only consistency we have seen so far came from a Progressive Democrats Minister&rsquo;s wife. When she wrote a report on behalf of the Department of Finance, she was consistent in so far as she continued the Government&rsquo;s tradition of blaming those who work in the health service for all the problems that exist within it.</P>
        <P>I visited Cavan General Hospital on a bank holiday Monday and saw an elderly man waiting there who had broken his hip the previous Saturday. He was still waiting to be transferred to the acute trauma unit in Drogheda. The words &ldquo;acute&rdquo; and &ldquo;trauma&rdquo; indicate that patients should be moved for treatment faster than three days but that is what seems to be happening in Cavan. A Fine Gael councillor told me about a lady who had survived cancer treatment and now has to thumb a lift from Cavan to Drogheda in order to attend for an outpatient&rsquo;s appointment there.</P>
        <P>Patients in the north east, and those who treat them, should be made aware that money is being wasted due to inefficiencies in the service, rather than the fact that we cannot afford the required investment.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>At this stage, people at Monaghan hospital can think of only one useful purpose for the piece of paper listing the last of the promises of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the people of that county. Those promises all seem to have gone by the wayside within the past four weeks.</P>
        <P>We have been told about the huge amount of money that is going into health services but what expenditure is being made? Let us focus on the Northern Eastern Health Board. In researching the provision of services in that health board region it became obvious that the north east has suffered from an unimaginative Government response to the crisis in that area. In the last three or four years the Department of Health and Children has been advising the North Eastern Health Board and other health boards that the initial allocation of their annual budgets will only cover what they did the year before. In other words, for a number of years Government funding for health and children has operated on the principle of an existing level of services. Government Deputies will say that the way to get extra health board services is through revised Estimates. That is where the extra money comes from, they say, but it is difficult to obtain facts and figures from the North Eastern Health Board in order to compare them.</P>
        <P>What we got for 2003 were details on how the north east fared on big issues which we are told are very close to the Government&rsquo;s heart. With a population of 350,000 the region got an additional &euro;2 million for cancer services. It got &euro;1.8 million for services for older people. For the primary care strategy it got &euro;400,000. We can understand why people get annoyed about &euro;50 million spent on e-voting and &euro;15 million on the equestrian centre at Punchestown. The amounts allocated for additional services in the region are minute in comparison.</P>
        <P>I will again quote from the T&aacute;naiste, who has set out her stall to be a reforming Minister for Health and Children. She said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s entirely appropriate that we should measure health service progress not by spending levels or reports and analysis, but by visible improvements seen by the public.&rdquo; This is certainly not a quote that would be attributed to her predecessor, who was a great man for reports, analysis and putting off everything until tomorrow. The T&aacute;naiste is correct in one respect. Health spending is not the same as service delivery. The Government has allowed spending to go out of control without any idea as to how it will increase the services it is supposed to deliver. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to show us how these millions are being spent and show us the great progress that has been made in recent years.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in primary care, which I would like to make a cornerstone of Fine Gael health policy. What is happening to primary care in the area under discussion is a good example of how patchy the services are. Parts of <Col N="86"/>the catchment area of Beaumont Hospital have one GP for every 2,500 patients. The national average is one GP for every 1,500 patients. One success story in the north east is the GP out-of-hours co-operative, NorthEastDOC. Unfortunately, it does not cover the area with the highest proportion of patients to doctors. No out-of-hours co-operative operates in any part of north Dublin. Even though some people have tried to link problems in accident and emergency departments with primary care, which is true, it is the lack of availability that is causing these problems. The Government has been aware of this issue and sat on it for some time.</P>
        <P>The Government is still struggling to get its first primary care centre fully operational in the North Eastern Health Board region. The primary care strategy promised 600 primary care centres, and three years into a ten-year programme we are still struggling to get the first ten off the ground. In recent years, to try to save money, health boards have been forced to cut home help allowances and funding for primary care projects that do not make the national media every day. Unfortunately, this is the price some elderly people with the opportunity of staying in their own homes must pay. Proper provision of sheltered accommodation and recognition that primary care services must become more focused on our increasingly elderly population is an issue on which the Government can talk the talk but has failed to walk the walk.</P>
        <P>Now that the T&aacute;naiste is in the House, I ask her when she became aware of the problems of primary care and what she plans to do about them. Some of my colleagues will talk more about the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and the Louth-Meath hospital group. The North Eastern Health Board has been vilified for the reorganisation of some of the health services carried out in the north east. The health board fully accepts it is not perfect but it was left with no choice because of lack of funding. Continually starving the health board of the resources to allow it deliver quality medical care, has led to it making some very hard choices to the detriment of the hospitals in question.</P>
        <P>While my colleagues will go into more detail on these hospitals, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to answer three specific questions. How does she intend to provide a five-day surgery at Monaghan General Hospital when a different surgeon is expected to be on duty every day? This is an unworkable procedure, which shows a clear lack of understanding of how the health services work. It is not possible to bring a different surgeon from Cavan General Hospital to Monaghan General Hospital and expect to have a five-day surgery unit that runs without hiccoughs.</P>
        <P>Why has one third of Cavan General Hospital not been commissioned since 1997? It only recently received approval for an extension to its accident and emergency department even though the accident and emergency department of <Col N="87"/>Monaghan General Hospital has been downgraded and practically closed for a number of years. Despite the extra workload, Cavan General Hospital did not get increased funding for acute beds when services were withdrawn from Monaghan General Hospital. This is why the health board has been forced to take decisions, which have, in some respects, been to the detriment of patient care.</P>
        <P>Why has Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda not received its designation as a regional hospital? Why have the regional services not been properly organised for the north-eastern region? What will happen to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which needs expansion immediately? It is amazing how doctors can work in that hospital given that it is so crowded and under-resourced.</P>
        <P>The credibility of the T&aacute;naiste is riding on her having taken the health portfolio. She should be commended for making such a brave decision. To show that she has the health services at her heart, I ask her to release the minutes of the Cabinet meeting held at Ballymascanlon. While most people here have forgotten about the meeting at Ballymascanlon, I have not. The media have a duty to revisit that fateful day in May 2001. The then Minister, Deputy Martin, brought some of his officials from the Department of Health and Children to give their views on the health services.</P>
        <P>After the meeting the Taoiseach said the health services were well resourced. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, believed that putting more money into health services was like pouring it down a black hole. What did the officials from the Department of Health and Children say that day, given that their advice was completely ignored by the Government? An element of hypocrisy is creeping into this matter. Five months after the Ballymascanlon meeting, the health strategy became Government policy. Three years on, when we expected an additional &euro;1 billion per year to be spent on the strategy, we find that this was also rich on aspirations but poor on delivery.</P>
        <P>Despite the primary care strategy and the health strategy, no progress is being made. While this is true throughout the country, it has been particularly poor in the north east. The primary care service has not been developed in the way one would expect. The acute hospital services have undergone serious reorganisation, which has created huge conflicts in communities.</P>
        <P>While Monaghan General Hospital has almost given up on maternity and accident and emergency services, I am sure the Deputies from Cavan-Monaghan will fight hard for that. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, wrote a letter outlining details of CAT scanners, extra beds, minor injury units and five-day surgery, which was called selective elective surgery. Even the commitment to that seems <Col N="88"/>wishy-washy. The people in the region understand that a different surgeon is supposed to drive from Cavan every day to man this unit. However, a post like that is simply not workable.</P>
        <P>The same applies to the way the hospital in Drogheda operates. It needs to get its designation, to be upgraded dramatically and to function as a regional centre. The population in the corridor between Dundalk and Dublin is growing at a huge rate. The accident there last week sadly shows why it needs upgraded acute services such as ambulances. We have neglected some core areas of the health services in the past seven years. We have seen developments in just one section of the health services to the detriment of others, which has led to poor value for money. I look forward to hearing what the T&aacute;naiste has to say about these figures. The Progressive Democrats has always taken great pride in being the watchdog for the taxpayers&rsquo; billions. Fianna F&aacute;il gave up on justice a long time ago and has now given up on the health services. We will have to warn the voters with VHI that there is no point in voting for Fianna F&aacute;il, and I wonder if they are any safer voting for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my party leader, Deputy Twomey and the front bench generally for bringing this important issue to the attention of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The crisis in the north east, especially in Cavan and Monaghan, has been documented extensively by the media. While it is sad that was necessary, the crisis there is a reality. I was delighted that the Cavan-Monaghan area was one of the first regions visited by Dr. Twomey, particularly on a bank holiday. What we saw, however, was not encouraging. There were people on trolleys and frustrated staff who wanted to deliver a service were unable to do so because of mismanagement and a lack of funds. I respect the T&aacute;naiste, although she did not deliver jobs to the Border area, and she must deal with the North Eastern Health Board. This area has suffered significantly in past years and deserves at least its fair share of money and services.</P>
        <P>The seriousness of the situation was highlighted by a man who lived all his life a few hundred yards from Monaghan General Hospital becoming ill a few weeks ago. Instead of going to Monaghan General Hospital, where his life might have been saved, he was put in an ambulance to bring him to Cavan. The previous Minister for Health and Children made a commitment before the local elections that medical emergencies would be brought by ambulance to Monaghan General Hospital, as would those needing other treatment. We were also promised that Monaghan General Hospital would stay open, with a new consultant surgeon and five junior hospital doctors, a consultant dermatologist, a consultant geriatrician and ten new beds. A commitment was given during the general election that all medical and surgical emergencies, as determined by the consultant on call, and 80% of accident and emergency would be treated at <Col N="89"/>Monaghan General Hospital and substantial funding would be made available. I know the value of political commitments but people&rsquo;s lives are at risk. This cannot continue indefinitely.</P>
        <P>The funding of the North Eastern Health Board is another question. Last year, the funding for the board was &euro;1,516 <i>per capita</i> against a national average of &euro;2,018. What have we done to deserve such treatment? As a result, the elderly cannot be looked after. Two and a half years ago, subventions for nursing homes were paid for 256 patients in the Cavan-Monaghan area but that has since been cut to 214. Are there fewer elderly people in the North Eastern Health Board area? Statistics show that between 1996 and 2002, there was an increase of 31.4% in those aged 85 or over. Those people needed more care and help but the budget in that area was cut so drastically that bed numbers were cut while beds are lying empty in high quality nursing homes.</P>
        <P>Home helps and carers have had their budgets cut, resulting in the number of hours for home helps being halved compared with two and a half years ago and many are only getting minor expenses for travelling. This is not the treatment to which those who built this State are entitled. People living in the North Eastern Health Board region must get the same as everyone else. I recently highlighted a case where a person had to go into a home in the west. It was the first time that the nursing home owner found it difficult to get a subvention for a person who had nothing. For six weeks the family had to pay for the care in spite of all the efforts I and others made.</P>
        <P>The hospital in Cootehill has been open for surgery for the last two and a half years but the unit for the elderly is still not in use because we cannot fund its everyday work. This is no way to spend capital. I know of an old age pensioner with no means who wants to get a toilet and other items into the house. The total cost is &euro;2,950 and the pensioner is being asked to pay &euro;537. This is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I was part of a group that went to study hospitals in isolated areas, such as Wick in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man. Above all else, we learned that primary care is vital. The T&aacute;naiste has made the right noises about the need to extend medical card cover but so many have been removed that we must talk about re-introducing them. We were promised 200,000 extra at the election but in the last seven years, 100,000 cards have been removed. In County Monaghan, 6,035 have been taken away in that time. Some people say that is not as bad as Cork, but that figure is being taken from a total population of 52,000 while Cork lost 8,000 medical cards in a population of 500,000. Much of the overcrowding in accident and emergency units could be avoided if people could visit their GPs using the medical card.</P>
        <P>In May, a letter from the previous Minister for Health and Children to members of the Fianna <Col N="90"/>F&aacute;il organisation &mdash; not to the people of Monaghan &mdash; promised that 24 hour medical cover will be provided at Monaghan General Hospital. The Minister hoped the letter would clarify the Government position and assist in silencing the rumours on Monaghan General Hospital. Then the Minister wrote a letter on 29 September to tell us that all was well and he had suddenly got agreement that 24 hour, seven days a week medical cover would be restored, five junior doctors recruited immediately at a cost of &euro;750,000 and a larger emergency room that would be open 24 hours a day would be provided. That was not decided that day, the planning had already been done and the contract signed. He promised ten additional beds, although he did not say how many beds had already been closed, and the provision of a CAT scanner. When I asked the T&aacute;naiste about this, the CAT scanner was missing.</P>
        <P>The problem is that so many commitments and promises have been made. The North Eastern Health Board called in the five Deputies from Cavan-Monaghan to tell us how the new structures would work. Cavan-Monaghan General Hospital would be a single unit but would operate on two sites. However, all services went to Cavan, but now services are being taken from Cavan as well. It is an extremely serious situation. People are isolated and must go to Drogheda in emergencies. Nobody questions serious trauma having to go to Drogheda. However, I came across cases at a meeting the other night where people had to travel to Drogheda for minor matters. The families concerned had to travel back and forward, yet there was no bus service. Surely, when one closes a service such as that provided by Monaghan General Hospital, one provides the services necessary to enable people to travel.</P>
        <P>Cavan-Monaghan General Hospital is still in crisis. My colleague, Deputy Twomey, who is a doctor, said he was not prepared to stand over something that was not right but he made it absolutely clear that a five-day surgical service was workable in Monaghan General Hospital, although not in the way the steering committee suggested whereby surgeons would travel on a daily basis. I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to meet the people there as quickly as possible and to ensure a realistic, logical and workable system is put in place before more lives are lost. I could highlight several situations but I do not want to be dramatic. My party, either in Opposition or in Government, will work to ensure a logical and workable structure is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Twomey on tabling this motion on behalf of Fine Gael. I welcome the constructive comments made up to now on how the North Eastern Health Board will develop in the years ahead. I congratulate the staff in all the hospitals and the community care teams, both voluntary and statutory, in communities who work so hard in the North Eastern <Col N="91"/>Health Board area to provide a better service for everyone. That is what a health service is about &mdash; it is about people working together in the statutory and voluntary areas to get the best service possible for the people.</P>
        <P>We must look at the way the health service is developing under North Eastern Health Board. One of the main problems is that there is no transparency or accountability in regard to decision-making since the health boards were abolished. I know there is a proposal to introduce legislation to deal with this issue but it is significant that the Government went ahead with the abolition of the health boards, or the corporate bodies, without replacing them. I am concerned about that. A simple example of lack of transparency arose following the recent publication of a report by the health board on health gain in the North Eastern Health Board area. Deputy English and I had to telephone the health board to get a copy of the report sent to us. Deputies are no longer part of the cc list in the health board region. That is not good enough and is not acceptable in the case of such a major report.</P>
        <P>An issue addressed by many people is community care. Keeping people out of acute hospitals is the way to go. The greater the investment in keeping people out of hospitals, the greater the health gain to the community, the better off such people would be, the more interaction they would have with society and the better things would be all round. There has been a major cut in home help services in the North Eastern Health Board area in recent years. In the last year of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s time in office, approximately 80,000 home help hours were cut. That was an appalling decision that impacted on the cutting edge of care in the community. Many elderly and sick people could not live properly or decently in their homes as a result. I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will reverse that decision during her time in office. Care of the elderly is one of the most important issues in our society and I note the T&aacute;naiste spoke on it when appointed to this position.</P>
        <P>A problem I face regularly, as I am sure do most Deputies, is the number of people in the community coming to see me about their elderly relatives in acute hospitals who are being discharged. There is not adequate or proper ownership of that issue &mdash; for example, a one-stop-shop for care of the elderly in each hospital area. If someone is in an acute hospital, one office should liaise with the family, the staff nurse, the nursing home and with everybody concerned to ensure the problem is dealt with efficiently, effectively and sympathetically. Some 99% of cases are dealt with in that way but some are not and they end up on my desk each morning. I am concerned that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children insist proper protocols are put in place in each acute hospital in the North Eastern Health <Col N="92"/>Board area whereby patients and their families would know to whom to go and to whom to talk so there would be no doubts and somebody from the administration would not tell people they must get their mother or father out of the hospital. People have concerns about that and about managing the care. Some people believe they must go out to find a private nursing home bed and that they may not have the capacity to pay for it. As people move towards the declining years of their lives, they need to feel wanted, esteemed and part of the system. In many cases, they feel upset and that they are not wanted. Their families feel nobody cares. That issue must be addressed and I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will address it.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 1,700 private nursing home beds in the four counties of the North Eastern Health Board. I live in County Louth where there are only 350 private nursing home beds &mdash; the remainder is in the adjoining counties. There is a need for an initiative in regard to public private partnerships with the health board to provide proper and adequate private nursing homes perhaps on health board property. It is alleged that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is to sell off health board property left, right and centre. That would be a poor decision. She should examine the needs of society, particularly health care and private nursing home care in County Louth. There is no reason the health board could not allow an operator to build a 60-bed unit on, or adjacent to, a hospital site. Those beds could be block booked for the foreseeable future so that we would have proper and adequate beds in our county and elderly people would not have to travel distances. An elderly person might be in a nursing home 20 or 30 miles away from his or her home and there might be no public transport, so it is impossible for people to visit. It is a serious issue that I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will address.</P>
        <P>Another issue, which has already been addressed, is the cut back in the number of medical cards. The percentage of the population of County Louth with medical cards is 35%. We have the most serious health problems in the North Eastern Health Board area &mdash; in fact, County Louth has the second highest rate of cancer in the country next to Dublin city. Many people who have serious illnesses do not have medical cards. A medical card should be available as a right to people with serious illnesses, regardless of income. Not everybody with cancer in the North Eastern Health Board area has a medical card, although they should have, especially if they have active cancer for which they are receiving treatment or are on drugs. That is a bad situation. I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children not only reviews the income limit for a medical card but that she ensures people who are very sick get one as a right regardless of their income.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;supports the North Eastern Health Board in its objective of ensuring the provision of a high quality, safe and responsive hospital service, commends the Government for the unprecedented increase in the level of investment in health services in the north east since 1997 and supports the early implementation of reform measures in order to deliver enhanced services in the region.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I propose to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the Fine Gael motion on hospital services in the North Eastern Health Board area. I would like to put on record my support and acknowledgement of the work of many people in this health board area in providing a high quality, safe and responsive hospital service. This Government&rsquo;s health policy has two key elements, namely to invest in service developments and to bring about lasting reform, with the single aim of delivering quality health care to people in a way that is accessible and available.</P>
        <P>We have taken action on both these fronts in terms of more investment and real reforms. We are taking action not just at a national level, but in each region. It is detailed work and it requires a unified effort from many people to make it happen. Change for the better is happening already. The task ahead is to ensure our economy generates the resources we need to invest in health, so that they are effectively channelled into better services and so we can implement decisions speedily as regards necessary reforms.</P>
        <P>The House knows that this year the Government is spending over &euro;10 billion in the health services. Over &euro;900 million in additional funding has been provided in 2004 in respect of day to day spending. The Estimates for 2005 are being finalised by the Government and I am confident they will show again the consistent record of this Administration in giving high priority to health.</P>
        <P>The overall increase in funding for all health boards between 1997 and 2004 has been &euro;5.2 billion, a threefold increase. The increase for the North Eastern Health Board has been &euro;383 million, more than three times the level of 1997. This is the largest increase in day-to-day funding of all health boards. It is, in part, an acknowledgement of the lower base level of funding in the North Eastern Health Board in 1997, but there can be no doubt that the Government has since then put substantial and unprecedented investment into the north east. This year, the funding provided for the North Eastern Health Board is &euro;549 million, an increase of almost &euro;66 million on 2003.</P>
        <P>People rightly ask what we are getting for all this funding. For one thing, more people are <Col N="94"/>being treated in our acute hospitals. Some 50,000 more people were treated in 2003 than in the previous year and 230,000 more were treated in acute hospitals in 2003 compared to 1997. The number of inpatients or day-cases in 2003 was more than a million. It will be higher again this year. Our hospitals are treating more people and are providing a broader range of treatment than ever before.</P>
        <P>In the north-eastern region the number of patients discharged from acute hospitals has increased from 53,000 in 1997 to 75,000 in 2003. The number of day cases has more than doubled from 12,000 in 1997 to 28,000 in 2003. Some 49 new consultant posts have been added to the 75 that existed in the region in January 1997. This is a 65% increase and compares well to the national increase of 46% in the same period.</P>
        <P>Hospital services in the North Eastern Health Board area are provided on an inpatient, day case and outpatient basis in two hospital groups. The Louth-Meath hospital group comprises Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Louth County Hospital, Dundalk and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan. The Cavan-Monaghan hospital group comprises Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals.</P>
        <P>The provision of acute hospital services in the north eastern region has been the subject of considerable debate over recent years, most of which has centred on the work undertaken by the health board in reorganising services, particularly across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group.</P>
        <P>The clear objective of the board has been to ensure the provision of a high quality, safe and responsive hospital service across all five sites in the region, for a population of approximately 350,000. The board has already made progress in reorganising services in a number of key areas such as trauma and orthopaedics, obstetrics and breast services. The recommendations and standards set by the regulatory and professional bodies, including the Medical Council and the Royal Colleges, have influenced the board in determining the future range and configuration of services across the region.</P>
        <P>The decision of the board to plan services across two hospital groups was entirely appropriate. Most reasonable people accept that it is not possible to develop the exact same range of services in each of the five hospital sites in the region. We are investing on a regional basis.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is being made in advancing the development of each of the five acute hospital sites under our capital programme. The Department of Health and Children issued approval earlier this year for site feasibility studies to be undertaken at both Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and at Monaghan General Hospital. This work is designed to assess the development potential of both sites. The Department has also agreed that design teams be selected for Cavan General Hospital, Louth County Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan.</P><Col N="95"/>
        <P>The site feasibility studies at Drogheda and Monaghan and the work of the design teams at the other three sites will inform the long-term development of the hospitals in the region. In the interim, I am pleased to inform the House that in August 2004, the Department issued approval to the board to implement a series of interim capital works. Specifically, the Department approved a design team to advance the provision of two modular theatres and for the upgrading of the kitchens at an estimated capital cost of &euro;1.4 million. A design team was appointed to progress the development of midwife-led units at Drogheda and at Cavan General Hospital at a capital cost of &euro;1.5 million. Design teams were approved to upgrade the accident and emergency department and the kitchens at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda at a combined capital cost of over &euro;4 million. Also, at Navan, a design team was approved to upgrade the existing orthopaedic operating theatre unit. The recent package of interim works will complement a significant level of capital investment in the hospital sector in the region in recent years, to which the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, will refer.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable focus on the configuration of services to be provided across the Cavan-Monaghan group. In July 2003, my predecessor as Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, published the report of Mr. Kevin Bonner setting out proposals for the future development of Monaghan General Hospital within the group. The report was commissioned by the Minister following the independent inquiry into events surrounding the birth and tragic death of baby Bronagh Livingstone on 11 December 2002. The Minister indicated at that time his acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. It was also accepted that additional services could be provided at the hospital to the benefit of the local community.</P>
        <P>The current position as regards the two hospitals is as follows. The board proposes to recruit five additional non-consultant hospital doctors to facilitate the early restoration of 24 hour, seven-day medical cover to Monaghan General Hospital, at an estimated additional revenue cost of &euro;500,000 a year. The Department is advised that the recruitment process is underway and it is anticipated by the board that these staff will be in place in early 2005. Work has commenced on the development of an expanded treatment room at Monaghan hospital. Capital funding of &euro;750,000 has been approved for this purpose. We have also approved revenue funding of &euro;500,000 to commission ten additional day beds at Monaghan General Hospital. The commissioning of these beds is to be progressed by the board and by the health service executive <Col N="96"/>next year. I expect these beds will be opened next year as a priority.</P>
        <P>The Department has also given financial clearance for the recruitment of three replacement consultant surgical posts to facilitate the development of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. The health board has recently submitted details of the revenue funding and staffing required to commission an additional 19 beds at Cavan General Hospital as part of the reconfiguration of services across the group. The submission is now being examined by the Department.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a population of 4 million. This is somewhat less than the population of the West Midlands in Britain, or Los Angeles in the United States. Our population is spread out over a greater area than either of these, although we are particularly concentrated on the eastern seaboard. We have to provide hospital services for the needs of our population, as we are doing in each region of the country, and in a way that ensures that best quality care is delivered. This cannot mean a few mega-hospitals in Dublin, nor a full service acute hospital in every town in the land. What is needed is in between those two extremes. It means a full range of hospital services on a regional basis working in a network, for all but the most specialised services.</P>
        <P>Since I became Minister for Health and Children, many people have told me that hospitals and doctors can work in networks to provide patients with top quality care by experienced professionals. We can deliver top quality hospital care in each region if we build our services on a regional basis, which is the essential vision behind the Hanly report. The report is not about taking services away from people, much less closing down hospitals, it is about finding ways to deliver top quality services for people in each region. The report is not about centralising services, but involves removing the need for people to travel outside their region for services.</P>
        <P>Balanced regional development involves regional hospital and health services as well as roads and factories. Far too many people must come to Dublin to have their medical needs addressed, including some from the North Eastern Health Board area. Anyone who truly favours balanced regional development will surely see the merit of developing hospital services for each county on a regional basis. The Government is not asking people to believe in a report, but intends to act to put in place the services people need on a regional basis. The Government intends to invest in and reform regional hospital services in a way which commands public confidence and support. When people see and experience what a 24-hour, seven days a week accident and emergency department staffed by consultants delivers, they will have much greater confidence in their regional hospital services. People do not want to page through technical reports on health service reform nor do <Col N="97"/>they believe that drafting a report will deliver an improvement in services. People simply want services they can have confidence in, and that is what we intend to deliver.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael motion asks by what mechanism the regional health offices of the new health service executive will be accountable to the D&aacute;il. Under the health service executive legislation, the primary, community and continuing care directorate will be organised into four regional health offices and 32 local health offices using the existing community care area structures. One of the four regions will be known as Dublin north east and will have a regional office in Kells in County Meath. While the motion assumes regional health offices will take over regional responsibility for all the services currently managed and delivered by health boards, this will not be the case. Regional health offices will co-ordinate services where they span more than one local area and will have responsibility for performance management, translating national policies through local areas and gathering and relaying information on a regional basis. Regional offices will ensure arrangements are put in place to engage with and consult members of the public, patients and elected public representatives on service provision. They will also ensure patients and service users receive a comprehensive and integrated response from the delivery system.</P>
        <P>The interim health service executive has identified the local health office as the primary service delivery unit in each community. Local and regional offices will be accountable to the board of the executive through the national directorates and the chief executive officer. Legislation to establish the executive on a statutory basis will be published shortly and it will report and be accountable to me as Minister for Health and Children. I place considerable emphasis on the introduction by the executive of a robust, quality customer service and, in particular, the development of an effective system of rapid response to inquiries from Members of the Oireachtas and the public. The health service executive will be accountable at national level for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>Regional structures are aimed at enabling meaningful and sustained dialogue and consultation between the executive and local public representatives and will facilitate representation by locally elected public representatives in the context of the operation and development of health and personal social services. Members will be nominated to the consultative fora by local authorities in each forum&rsquo;s functional area. These mechanisms will complement and reinforce the role of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health services. The health service executive will build on the existing strength of consumer panels and co-ordinating committees within the health system. <Col N="98"/>The forthcoming legislation will enable the executive to establish advisory panels specifically aimed at effective consultation with local communities on the provision and development of services.</P>
        <P>Our comprehensive programme of investment and reform is tangible evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of high quality, cost-effective and responsive hospital services to all people in the north-eastern region. I acknowledge the work of the north eastern board in pursuing a programme of hospital reform in a challenging and changing environment. The new health service executive will soon take this work forward. This is a great opportunity to give additional impetus to implementing best practice and reform in hospital services in the north east. Our objective continues to be to ensure that a comprehensive range of services is available and accessible locally and that patients who require access to specialist care outside a region are in a position to receive high quality and timely care. I am confident we can and will deliver this service to the people of the north east.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael motion places strong emphasis on the need to properly resource the hospital sector in the north east and to invest in services at Beaumont Hospital. I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House on behalf of the Government some of the significant developments being progressed for the benefit of patients who reside in the north east. The product of this investment is reflected not just in terms of expenditure, activity and employment numbers, but also in the continuous drive to improve the quality of services provided. The Government is committed to the further development of services in the north east in line with available resources.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has referred to the package of interim capital works approved for the north east pending the longer term redevelopment of each hospital group. The investment package will complement significant capital investment in the region&rsquo;s hospital sector in recent years. For example, a cardiac rehabilitation unit opened at Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, in 2002 while an additional 14 beds opened under the national bed-capacity initiative. The full-year revenue cost of these beds exceeds &euro;1.4 million. Last year, the Department sanctioned the purchase by the board of 6.85 acres of land adjacent to Louth County Hospital at a cost of &euro;2.6 million for development purposes.</P>
        <P>Developments at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda include the upgrading of the intensive care and coronary care units at a capital cost of &euro;1.3 million. An additional four beds were commissioned in June at an additional revenue cost of &euro;800,000 and an extensive re-equipping programme was implemented over three years costing in the region of &euro;2 million. Furthermore, a new symptomatic breast care and <Col N="99"/>palliative care service commenced in June 2004 with the commissioning of new modular accommodation and a cardiac rehabilitation service commenced in July 2004.</P>
        <P>Capital developments at Navan in recent years have included&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is a joke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department, rehabilitation department, outpatient department, medical ward and main hallways. All X-ray equipment has been replaced while X-ray rooms have been refurbished. An eight-bed day ward and a four-bed intensive care high dependency unit have been provided while the female medical ward has been refurbished. An additional 14 beds were commissioned under the bed-capacity initiative and car parking facilities have been improved.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste covered the development of services across the Cavan-Monaghan group which has been the subject of particular comment. The range of developments to which the T&aacute;naiste referred occurred in addition to an investment package of &euro;4.5 million which has been provided since 1999 to fund interim capital projects at Monaghan General Hospital. The main projects completed over the period were the provision of a new modular theatre, refurbishment of a female medical ward, the upgrading of the boiler plant and a car park extension.</P>
        <P>Cancer and cardiovascular services in the north east have been developed significantly. Since 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;28 million to develop appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer in the north-eastern region. This investment has enabled the funding of ten additional consultant posts together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, haematology, breast surgery and palliative care. The funding has also facilitated the appointment of 20 nurse specialists across the region. Cardiovascular services have received additional funding of almost &euro;5 million to support a 32% increase in admissions since 1997. In the context of the Estimates for 2005 the Department will consider proposals for the further development of cancer and cardiovascular services in the north east.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The future resourcing of Beaumont Hospital is also mentioned in the Fine Gael motion. I take this opportunity to outline some of the major developments which are taking place at Beaumont Hospital and which are being supported by the Exchequer. In 2000, an extensive programme of general equipping and refurbishment was approved for the hospital. The equipment replacement component of the programme has now been completed. The refurbishment programme will allow the hospital to commence a wide range of improvements to its existing infrastructure. The <Col N="100"/>combined investment in equipment replacement and refurbishment at Beaumont Hospital will be of the order of &euro;40 million. Other developments approved in recent years at Beaumont Hospital include a capital grant of &euro;1.3 million to upgrade electrical services, an additional 35 beds funded under the bed capacity initiative, recent approval for the provision of a second MRI scanner at the hospital, a capital grant of &euro;1.5 million for the provision of an enhanced tissue-typing facility at the hospital and the provision of a purpose-built 44-station dialysis unit.</P>
        <P>In addition, Beaumont Hospital has recently taken management responsibility for St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital, Raheny. Funding has been approved for the provision of a 15-bed rehabilitation unit at St. Joseph&rsquo;s for patients over 65 requiring rehabilitation following a stroke or other life changing-threatening condition. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also approved funding for the recruitment of ten extra consultants who will provide additional services at Beaumont and St. Joseph&rsquo;s hospitals.</P>
        <P>The level of investment in hospital and emergency services in the north east is impressive by any standards. The range of developments described is comprehensive. New developments are being put in place at each of the five acute hospital sites. This is being done in a planned way and is consistent with the national and regional policy framework. The Government will continue to support the development of services in the region which are responsive, safe and of the highest quality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek permission to share time with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy sharing time with Deputy Costello?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>No. I welcome the motion proposed by Fine Gael which deals with specific problems in the North Eastern Health Board area but it also highlights important aspects of our health service nationally that have suffered severely from the ineptitude and lethargy of the Government. Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have had over seven years to improve the health service and to increase access to it, in the North Eastern Health Board area as well as everywhere else in the country. This Government has had more money than any other before it. The record shows that far from spending money wisely the Government has squandered money in the area of health to such an extent that many of the problems are getting worse rather than better. Thousands of public patients are still on hospital waiting lists while fewer patients enjoy the security of a medical card. There is a chronic crisis in our accident and emergency services, a shortage of nurses in key intensive care units and for the first time our national maternity hospital has imposed new and unprecedented restrictions on pregnant women availing of maternity care. The <Col N="101"/>record shows &mdash; I say this with some regret &mdash; this is a Government with more money than sense.</P>
        <P>Foolishness and fraudulence are the hallmarks of the Government. It is foolish in how the money was squandered and fraudulent in regard to what was promised to the people before the general election and what was actually delivered after it. It is important that the new Minister for Health and Children who has a reputation for honesty tries to keep to that reputation. The picture she painted of the Hanly report is grossly inaccurate. The Hanly report specifically proposes the closing of accident and emergency units on a 24 hour seven day basis in hospitals right across the country. That is set out unequivocally. If it was held as the letter of the law there would be no full-time accident and emergency department for the south east between St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital. That is the logic of Hanly and we had better refresh our minds in that regard because the T&aacute;naiste is either deliberately woolly or is trying to say that Hanly is something other than it is.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about her views on the health service executive reforms. The whole purpose of the argument on transparency is to seek a better way to have accountability in the system because we all recognise the health board system was flawed. What is being proposed, as is clear from what the T&aacute;naiste has said, is a regional level which does not have responsibility for the services being provided and yet is charged with providing accountability and consultation. That does not make sense. How will people impact on a service if they are dealing with a level of authority that, in effect, has no authority over the services at local level? She misses the point when she says county councils would select who would be on the consultative bodies. The great strength of accountability is direct reference back to the people. What she should do even at this 11th hour is to ensure that anybody that is providing accountability in the system is directly elected by the people. Had the health board members been directly elected by the people they would have been much more effective and focused in the work they did. The T&aacute;naiste is introducing the same lack of clarity and lack of accountability into the new system which will make it inefficient. She does not appreciate just how closed the system has become because there is no media scrutiny of health board meetings as there are no meetings. There are no public representatives on boards because there are no boards. It is a virtual board and its only purpose is to provide a seal for the CEO to make all the decisions.</P>
        <P>As the motion states we are blessed with the nurses, doctors and health care professionals who are second to none and who work to a standard of excellence even when the conditions within which they work militate against excellence. The INO has today again produced figures showing an increase in the number of people, 221 patients, lying on trolleys or sitting on chairs as we debate <Col N="102"/>this issue. Certainly Dublin is in the forefront in receipt of the pressure but the experience in the North Eastern Health Board has not been good either.</P>
        <P>In an unprecedented move this summer, 25 general practitioners in the catchment area of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda wrote to the Minister for Health and Children outlining their grave concern at the pressures in the hospital resulting from the transfer of services from Dundalk and Monaghan hospitals as well as an increase in population and the policy in the hospital to expand specialist services. They said, &ldquo;In the absence of a plan to either extend the hospital on its current site or build a new hospital lives are being put at risk, morale in the hospital is inevitably low&rdquo;. The doctors also claim that the accident and emergency department is inadequate and often over-crowded, that there is no space for proper X-ray facilities, not enough theatres to service the surgical teams, that general practitioners do not have access to basic diagnostic tools such as ultrasound or physiotherapy and that the flow of consultants locum coverage is such that there is no working knowledge as to who is to do what job on a weekly basis. They refer to the fact that there are no emergency referrals in gynaecology and paediatric departments and a four year waiting list for urology appointments. The T&aacute;naiste has restated various commitments for the hospital as if they were some major achievements. Any improvements regarding this hospital are long overdue and they involve the provision of necessities. A little humility and honesty in this regard would be helpful. Let us remember that this is a flagship hospital in the North Eastern Health Board region and that it is to become a centre of excellence. It did not have the problems of other hospitals in the region. If it did, they certainly have not been as pronounced recently.</P>

	<P>I reiterate the importance of having the debate in this Chamber. It could not be held anywhere else. The North Eastern Health Board has lost its accountability. I suggest that the Minister examine what has been happening in our health boards since scrutiny ended.</P>
        <P>I get the impression that CEOs are availing of their considerable powers, including powers to buy and sell property. How much land is being sold at a time when the Minister for Health and Children is talking about selling lands? Unfortunately, I believe selling lands is for short-term gain. It appears that in some health boards, CEOs are ahead of the Minister in that they are making arrangements and doing deals to provide for various projects, which I have no doubt have been approved. These arrangements are making a nonsense of the Minister&rsquo;s talk of selling off lands to provide for certain services.</P>
        <P>Let me refer briefly to the needs of Beaumont Hospital. There is a desperate need for additional posts in clinical neurophysiology at Beaumont and the Mater hospitals. These posts have not been sanctioned because there is some argument between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children. As a result, both hospitals are extremely frustrated by the difficulties experienced and the gross inefficiency arising from reliance on locums. There has been a steady loss of qualified technical staff as a result of the delays. Beaumont has now stopped performing outpatient EEGs. There are long delays for other investigations, thus impacting significantly on patient care. I ask the Minister to address this issue as a priority.</P>
        <P>It has been striking how both the neurology specialists and advocates of their patients have come together to make a strong case for the additional posts to be sanctioned and for resources to be put in place. Many patients are vulnerable and very often cannot articulate their needs, but in spite of the case being made for them, nothing has happened. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children heard a very powerful case, but there has still been no progress. I urge the Minister to address this issue.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time. I welcome this Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion and thank Deputy Twomey and his colleagues for tabling it. I recognise no small effort on the part of my constituency colleague, Deputy Crawford, in influencing its construction.</P>
        <P>I was flabbergasted by the absolute gall of Government in the amendment it tabled to this motion. That members of Government can come into this Chamber and seek to commend the Government &ldquo;for the unprecedented increase in the level of investment in health services in the <Col N="104"/>north east since 1997&rdquo; challenges every truth and reality that the people of the north east have known since 1997. In 1998 the framework document for the configuration of hospital care delivery in the north east was unanimously signed off by the North Eastern Health Board and political opinion across the north-eastern region, including me. I was not then a member of the North Eastern Health Board but I looked forward to the implementation of the commitments contained in the document. Little did I know the vista that lay before me when I became a member of the North Eastern Health Board the following year, 1999, after the local government elections. The document was already in flitters in litter bins in the CEO&rsquo;s office and every other office of the administration of health care locally, regionally and nationally.</P>
        <P>It is timely and appropriate that we should focus this evening on the North Eastern Health Board area, which has experienced some of the worst results of what clearly have been the fundamentally flawed health policies of the Government. I have long and bitter experience of the neglect by successive Governments of the health service needs of the people of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the north Louth area. The fight for the retention of Monaghan General Hospital did not begin today or yesterday. One should not mistake that it dates back to the 1980s, when the matter was in the hands of a previous manifestation of this Government, when the existence of the hospital was under threat.</P>
        <P>Although the current configuration of Government was not in power at the time, the opportunities were there, and they were there subsequently. Those placed in responsible roles failed to match up not only the expectations of the local community but also the rights and needs of local people. The threat of closure was averted through the determined campaigning of the local community at the time. In that regard, I pay tribute to the late Paddy Turley, the then editor of <i>The Northern Standard</i>, who played a leading part in the campaign and continued in that role almost until his recent death. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm d&iacute;lis.</P>
        <P>While our hospital remains a vital part of our community infrastructure, it has suffered successive losses of key services. Most serious of all these losses is the closure of the maternity unit and the accident and emergency unit. The axing of such vital services is neither forgotten nor forgiven. The community in Monaghan remains absolutely determined to ensure the return of these units. That demand has never been withdrawn and I reassert it tonight.</P>
        <P>As a member of the North Eastern Health Board from 1999, I saw at first hand how the system worked, or did not work, depending on one&rsquo;s point of view. Elected representatives were effectively sidelined while all the real decisions were taken by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, the other professional bodies, representative bodies of the various consultant interests, the Department of Health and Children, the CEO of the North Eastern Health Board and those who aligned themselves with his determination to reduce the <Col N="105"/>level of service provision at Monaghan General Hospital. The community I represented then and now had little or no say in how health care was delivered. There was little accountability and minimal information. This is in no way to diminish the professionalism, courtesy and helpfulness of many health board staff with whom I worked over these years and whom I hold in very high regard.</P>
        <P>We must examine what has happened under the Government&rsquo;s so-called reform of the health services. What little accountability there was has been taken away. The health boards, with their representation from elected bodies and sectoral groups, have been abolished. They will be replaced with bigger regional super bureaucracies and-or a health services executive. The centralisation of services, as well as bureaucracy, will put further strain on already over-stretched hospitals in the Dublin region. The motion refers to Beaumont hospital, which will soon be in the same region as the current North Eastern Health Board area. I know from my colleague in Dublin, Councillor Larry O&rsquo;Toole, who represents the area where Beaumont hospital is located, that the hospital is already under severe strain. This is being reflected right down to the grassroots within the regions. Like all our hospitals, it suffers staff shortages and under-resourcing.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to the tragic events that occurred in the North Eastern Health Board area. These include the tragic death of baby Bronagh Livingstone whose name will forever be associated with the closure of Monaghan maternity unit. More recently, an elderly resident of Monaghan town, Benny McCullagh, who lived close to the hospital, died en route to Cavan General Hospital. A lady from Clontibret also died in an ambulance en route to the Louth hospital in Dundalk. There have been many other tragic experiences, not all resulting in loss of life but tragic nonetheless, leaving a real and indelible mark in the memory of people relating to their hospital and health care experience within the north eastern region and, in the main, allied to the loss of critical services at Monaghan General Hospital. This is the common denominator in all these events.</P>
        <P>We heard in recent days that maternity hospitals are warning they cannot cope, and may have to cap the number of admissions. What type of horrible prospect are we seeing painted before us? Even in the worst days for this economy, we never had such a situation, nor was one threatened. It is almost miraculous that a Government could so mismanage public services in this prosperous State that we cannot cope with the birth of children. It is an absolute outrage and demonstrates the folly of closing maternity units in local hospitals, and determining maternity provision on the basis of what I can only describe as arbitrary numbers of births per consultant per year. These are figures suited to other countries and they do not take account of the real needs of the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I listened to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s contribution to the debate and am shocked and astonished. Even in terms of the short time from when the previous <Col N="106"/>Minister, Deputy Martin, vacated his role and his eve of exit announcement, we can see that a significant part of what he then committed to is no longer a currency within the statement of the current Minister. The Minister of State is nodding his head, but can he tell me when the CAT scan will be introduced to Monaghan General Hospital? I support the motion.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the important motion before the House. Like other Deputies from the Cavan-Monaghan area, I had reason on many occasions in the House to raise issues in regard to the delivery of health services in the Cavan-Monaghan area.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s closing remarks on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement here this evening. Senator Wilson and I had meetings with the T&aacute;naiste since she took office as Minister for Health and Children and she is committed to the implementation of the agreement announced in late September by the previous Minister, Deputy Martin. The T&aacute;naiste did not have time in her contribution to cover each specific area.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should listen if he wants to hear the truth. The Fine Gael motion does not refer to one area for which I would give credit to the North Eastern Health Board, and which other public representatives and I raised down through the years, namely, the need to provide proper care for the elderly. In recent years, modern state-of-the-art facilities for the elderly have been provided at Breffni care unit, Ballyconnell, and a 50 bed nursing unit and community health facility at Virginia, which were provided at substantial cost and deliver an excellent service to patients who avail of them. The health care unit in Virginia is an excellent example of how primary care should be provided. It provides one of the best services to patients from the area. I support fully the agreement announced by the previous Minister, Deputy Martin. The T&aacute;naiste stated clearly that she is determined to implement these proposals, which will provide a much better standard of care and health delivery for the people of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>I am pleased that at last the North Eastern Health Board has put proposals to the Department of Health and Children in regard to commissioning an additional 19 beds at Cavan General Hospital. It will only take a reconfiguration of services within the existing hospital to provide the additional 19 beds. It is absolutely essential these are brought on stream and commissioned as soon as possible. Another issue other public representatives and I have raised is the need to use all Cavan General Hospital. Public representatives in the area are aware that a former Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, in decisions made in the mid-1980s, decided that part of Cavan General Hospital, which had been recently built, would not be commissioned. I am pleased <Col N="107"/>that decisions were made some time ago to bring that area of the hospital, which was known as medical 3, into use. I have made strong representations to the T&aacute;naiste that this area of the hospital be put to use. The design team is currently working on the proposal.</P>
        <P>When we talk about health services in the North Eastern Health Board area, we must not just look at the north east as an area comprising only Meath, Louth and Monaghan-Cavan. We must think of our neighbouring counties north of the Border. There is no reason we cannot have greater development of services on the basis of Sligo-Enniskillen, Cavan-Enniskillen and Monaghan, with a number of hospitals north of the Border, and likewise the hospitals in County Louth, with their counterparts in Daisyhill and others north of the Border. We must examine the delivery of the health services on an all-island basis. We are living in a constituency that would be the greatest beneficiary of a development of services based on an all-Ireland context.</P>
        <P>There have been excellent developments in the North Eastern Health Board area in recent years. I take the opportunity to highlight the renal dialysis service provided at Cavan General Hospital for Monaghan, Cavan, north Longford, south Leitrim and part of Westmeath and Meath. The service providers are doing an excellent job in providing a renal dialysis service of the highest quality. I am pleased that some months ago the Minister for Health and Children approved the appointment of a consultant nephrologist. The appointment will come on stream shortly and it will allow a further development of the renal dialysis service at Cavan General Hospital, in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital, which is a centre of excellence in the whole area of nephrology etc. This is the type of area that needs to be developed.</P>
        <P>Monaghan General Hospital must be used to its full capacity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter. We have concluded tonight&rsquo;s debate on the health service in the north-east region and I am looking forward to contributing on that debate tomorrow night.</P>
        <P>The matter I am raising on the Adjournment relates to health board land at St. Bridget&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital in Ardee. The land at Currabeg was sold to an industrial prospector for a pharmaceutical plant. There was a long protracted negotiation on planning permission, which was eventually granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but, <Col N="108"/>unfortunately, the specific project did not proceed. I understand that the North Eastern Health Board is making arrangements to have the land returned to its ownership, as per the original agreement when the land was sold to the pharmaceutical company.</P>
        <P>There is considerable concern in the Ardee and mid-Louth area about what will happen the land when it returns to health board ownership. There is existing planning permission for a pharmaceutical facility on it, which clearly enhances its value and leaves it in a prime position for the location of a pharmaceutical plant if a suitable one were to turn up. Can we have an assurance from the Department that the land will continue to be available for industrial development purposes in the town of Ardee in west Louth? It has not been easy to attract industry to Ardee. The advantage of a ready-made suitable site, not alone for a pharmaceutical facility but for other industries that might come to the area, would benefit the general promotional efforts to attract much needed industry to the town and this part of County Louth.</P>
        <P>I also refer to the land to which the T&aacute;naiste referred in her contribution on the Private Members&rsquo; debate, the land purchased recently which adjoins the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk. We were told recently that land assets are to be brought back into the ownership of health boards and, in certain circumstances, to be sold on. The land at the Louth County Hospital was bought with the clear intention of expanding facilities at the hospital for the future. County Louth has two of the largest provincial towns in the country, Drogheda and Dundalk, where because of the demographic position, health services are under considerable pressure. We hope that the land purchased at Louth County Hospital will be retained for future expansion of the facilities at the hospital.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, will respond on the Adjournment. I look forward to his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Department of Health and Children is not aware of speculation concerning the lands in question. I have made inquiries from the North Eastern Health Board about the issues raised.</P>
        <P>With regard to the lands at Currabeg, Ardee, I am advised that the North Eastern Health Board intends to re-acquire the lands from a third party at the original purchase price paid to it, in accordance with the terms of the sale of the lands. I understand it had been a condition of the sale that an industrial development would be created on the site by the purchaser. While some planning difficulties which had occurred over the years are now resolved, I am informed that the board currently feels that it is uncertain that the planned development for the site will occur. Because of <Col N="109"/>the increased value of the site, the North Eastern Health Board has decided to exercise the condition of the sale on the option to buy back the land at Currabeg.</P>
        <P>The position on the land at Louth County Hospital is that the Department gave approval to the board in December 2003 to purchase a site adjacent to the hospital. This site was recognised as being of strategic value for the potential future development of health facilities in the area. The site has been included in the development control plan for Louth County Hospital which I understand is at an advanced stage of preparation by the board. I hope this response is satisfactory.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Kerry&rsquo;s general hospital was built in the late 1970s and when fully operational has 377 hospital beds. In recent years two wards have been closed down each summer. Each year the number of babies born has increased and the number has rocketed in the past two years. This is an indication of the confidence the people of Kerry, north Cork and west Limerick have in the service provided in Tralee General Hospital. Only two weeks ago I had the beautiful experience of my granddaughter being born there. I compliment the staff on the tremendous work they do, despite the difficulties encountered.</P>
        <P>Despite an increase of 40% in the number of babies born in Tralee, staffing levels have remained static. Approximately 1,460 children were born there last year and the figure for this year is running at 150 a month. Despite this growth there is a shortage of midwives. When applications were sought for the position of midwife last month, not one person applied. Six midwives have left the hospital this year. The question must be asked as to the reason for this.</P>
        <P>The situation is so serious that the eminent gynaecologist, Dr. Mary McCaffrey, went public yesterday out of frustration and desperation. She is a fantastic person who does tremendous work, but is at her wit&rsquo;s end. She has called for the provision of a new maternity unit and the immediate approval of funds for more doctors and staff. I urge the Minister to address this matter.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nurses Organisation has sought an urgent meeting with senior Southern Health Board officials to discuss the chaos in Kerry&rsquo;s general hospital. People are particularly exasperated on account of the fact that the advertisement for three midwives got no response. We must ask why. The reason is evident, according to one of the local newspapers, which states that it is because of poor conditions and wages. Matters are so desperate that some midwives have had to work in the wards changing beds and helping ordinary staff.</P>
        <P>All the elected representatives in the area are aware of the situation and they and I have raised the matter here on several occasions. Something <Col N="110"/>needs to be done about the accident and emergency unit, bed closures and the maternity section. The problems must be addressed now. Matters must be serious when we see a conservative newspaper like <i>The Kingdom</i> state:</P>
        <P LI="1">It can only be a matter of time before the ordinary people of Kerry follow the example of disgruntled patients and their families in Dublin and take to the streets in protest. If they do, <i>The Kingdom</i> will be right there beside them and we will shout loudest and longest.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the situation that is developing, according to the local widely read newspaper. These are not the sentiments of somebody like me in the business of opposition, these are the feelings of people on the ground who have visited the hospital, seen the waiting lists, the accident and emergency unit where people are lying on trolleys and the continued deterioration in the maternity section.</P>
        <P>The Minister must listen to the staff who are crying out for help. The numbers born in the maternity section have been turned around and there are now more children born in Kerry&rsquo;s general hospital than at any time since 1979, especially in the past few years. Previously mothers went to Cork University Hospital to have their children but that trend has been reversed due to the tremendous service provided in Tralee despite the lack of funds. There is a chance for the Minister to turn the situation around, but she needs to address the matter urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ferris for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I congratulate him on the recent birth of his grandchild in Tralee hospital.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the provision of services at Kerry&rsquo;s general hospital in Tralee rests with the Southern Health Board. A capital projects development team for Kerry General Hospital, Tralee was established in September 2000 to prepare a strategy plan for the current and future needs of the hospital. The development plan included the construction of a purpose-built maternity unit.</P>
        <P>On 11 February this year, the Southern Health Board sent a statement of need to the Department of Health and Children for a women&rsquo;s health unit at Kerry General Hospital, Tralee. This statement of need sets out the current position on the delivery of maternity services at the hospital, which are under pressure to cater for the current demands for the service. The growth in demand for obstetric services is evident from the number of births at the hospital, which increased from 1,163 in 1999 to 1,452 in 2003. Establishment of a project team to progress proposals for a new maternity unit at Kerry General Hospital falls to be considered in the context of overall funding resources available under the Capital Investment Framework 2004-2008.</P><Col N="111"/>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children understands that the Southern Health Board is in the process of updating the statement of need to take account of the most recent needs identified for the service. In June 2004, the Department approved the filling of a third permanent consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist post at Kerry General Hospital. I understand that the board has now advertised this post.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Southern Health Board will continue to work together to identify a means of progressing this project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>My constituents, an elderly couple whose only income is their invalidity pension, find themselves caught in a health care trap between the cost and availability of private care and the famine of available health care for public patients. This couple has no savings and very limited borrowing capacity. Any borrowing they can access via their credit union places a very severe financial burden on them to repay a loan.</P>
        <P>The wife had a number of medical procedures carried out at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which were unsuccessful. She had ongoing visits to doctors and stays in the hospital, was constantly in pain and found herself on ever-extending waiting lists for treatment. Finally, the consultant advised that he could do no more for her. A number of emergencies occurred in the midst of all of this.</P>
        <P>Her husband decided, having carefully considered the cost, that consulting a private consultant and going as a private patient was worthy of investigation and he undertook to speak to a consultant in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. The consultant decided that treatment was a possibility and that he would undertake to carry out the appropriate procedure.</P>
        <P>At this point the husband discussed the possible cost with the hospital. He was told that the daily cost would be of the order of &euro;225. He decided to borrow this from the credit union and worked out carefully how he would make the repayments. The couple decided together that this was worthwhile and that the consequent improvement in her health would be worth the financial strain of the repayments.</P>
        <P>However, they were genuinely unaware that the cost outlined to them referred only to the hospital bed, that it did not include the cost of any specialist tests, the anaesthetist, laboratory reports and so on. All of these additional costs had not been referred to when they made their inquiries. A number of complications arose and she required not one but three weeks in hospital. They now find themselves with an outstanding bill of &euro;7,500. This has been going on since 1999. They are in no position to pay this bill. However, they defrayed the costs of the consultant, the anaesthetist and so on to the extent of &euro;2,500.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>This couple acted entirely in good faith. They planned carefully for the hospital as far as they were aware. They were unaware of the complexities of private hospital treatment for the simple reason that they had never had the opportunity to avail of it previously. To add insult to injury in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital on a previous occasion, the patient needed a CAT scan. When her husband telephoned the hospital to make an appointment as a public patient &mdash; and his consultant advised him that it was urgent &mdash; he was told that there was a waiting list of approximately 18 months. Again, he decided he would save up the cost of a private consultation. He telephoned the same hospital to make an appointment as a private patient and was asked what time the following day he would like to have the appointment.</P>
        <P>In a general way, this points up the gross inequality of the private and public facilities and waiting times. It is totally unacceptable and is placed in sharp focus by the dilemma in which this couple find themselves. It is particularly unacceptable when an elderly couple must worry and fret over the cost of health care when illness is already a major burden for them. They now find themselves with an enormous bill that they cannot hope to pay.</P>
        <P>They have received a number of reminders from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital as well as reminders more recently from a firm of solicitors acting on behalf of the hospital, and they are now under constant stress because of this bill hanging over their heads. Any consultant they met did not suggest to them that they might have been eligible for the national treatment purchase fund. They would have been more than happy to avail of this if they had been informed of it.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to review this case sympathetically and to arrange to waive the outstanding amount that this couple has been billed for. They are unable to pay it now or in the future because of the constant strain on their already very meagre resources through ongoing ill health.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>I understand the person to which the Deputy referred received treatment in a private hospital and is seeking assistance to cover the cost involved.</P>
        <P>I should like, first of all, to point out to the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of health services to residents of counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
        <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at &euro;45 per night, subject to a maximum of &euro;450 in any twelve consecutive months, in respect of inpatient public hospital services.</P><Col N="113"/>
        <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. The 1989 Commission on Health Funding recommended on the grounds of equity that patients make an explicit choice between public and private health care.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. I would add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. In this regard my Department has forwarded the case referred to by the Deputy to the Regional Chief Executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority for consideration.</P>
        <P>I will raise the matter with the CEO because I understand the hardship involved for an elderly couple caught in this situation, having come across such cases previously.</P>

        <P>The case I must make this evening relates to the School of the Holy Spirit in Kilkenny. No words of mine can describe the anger and frustration of parents who are waiting to have their children placed in this school.</P>
        <P>The issue regarding the school as been going on since the school first occupied that building almost 12 years ago. It is a prefabricated building not built for the purpose of education. It certainly does not meet the modern day needs of a school of this type. It has been in existence for the past 12 years. There are currently 31 children and 20 staff housed in a very small building and various temporary structures outside of that building. There is a complete lack of facilities at the school and it does not lend itself to the proper education of the children who attend there and who are availing of the type of education being provided.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, it is frustrating that the temporary accommodation that was promised has now been stalled for some reason. The argument has dragged on and on. The parents have been encouraged, with the supporters of the school, to write to every D&aacute;il Deputy in the constituency to highlight the problem. I now highlight the problem on their behalf.</P>
        <P>There is a need to provide a special purpose-built school on the site which has been made available at Seville Lodge, Callan Road, Kilkenny. This project has been dragging on and <Col N="114"/>there seems to be some problem in implementing the next stage. Parents of the children who attend the school are anxious that they be given a clear commitment from the Department with regard to the completion of the next stage and its funding. In the interim, I ask that any obstacles in the way of the provision of the temporary accommodation be removed immediately and that the school be provided with the proper accommodation for its pupils. The hardship that is created relates to the fact that many of the children attending the school, some of them autistic, are unable to access the home support which would keep them up to speed in the context of the attention they would normally receive in the school. Action must be taken in this matter.</P>
        <P>There is also a problem with regard to those parents who are trying to look after their children at home in that they are not receiving the support that is required. Some children are getting 20 hours home tuition while others are getting far less. Various decisions are being made with regard to home tuition relative to the number of hours given. It is not good enough that the education of these special children is put on the long finger. That they are not receiving sufficient tuition at home adds further to the burden of the parents.</P>
        <P>I highlight the Goresbridge situation, where more than &euro;250,000 in funding was announced by the Department for the refurbishment of an old school building for the education of children with autism. I joined the associated group when it lobbied departmental officials and a very clear indication was given that &euro;253,000 would be allocated to the project. We are anxious to see this money spent on refurbishment. The project was sponsored by Saplings and Mr. Marc de Salvo, and we are anxious that they should be involved in the provision of education at the newly-refurbished building.</P>
        <P>There is some uncertainty as to the method which will be used in the context of the delivery of education at Goresbridge. Saplings should be central to this but I understand the Department has stated that only aspects of applied behavioural analysis, ABA, will be used. This is not what we entered into in the beginning. When this issue was discussed with departmental officials, a clear plan was set out for the school. This included a provision of &euro;250,000 for refurbishment and the central involvement of Saplings and Mr. Marc de Salvo in the running of the school. The experience gathered by the Saplings group would be of great benefit to those who attend the school.</P>
        <P>A High Court case is pending with regard to one family which has spent more than &euro;80,000 in the care of a child while awaiting the opening of the facility in Goresbridge. I urge the Minister to consider these families, those availing of the Holy Spirit special school and the facility in Goresbridge, and the family caught up in a High Court case with her Department. I ask her to bring them <Col N="115"/>some relief in the context of the provision of special education of this kind in County Kilkenny. A great effort has been made by the local community and I indicate my support for the project. It is difficult to find the words to describe the community&rsquo;s anger and frustration, which I hope the Minister will relieve with some announcement.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising his obvious concern regarding the Holy Spirit special school in Kilkenny and the proposed new autism facility in Goresbridge. My Department is aware of the increased demand for dedicated educational provision for children with autism. Only yesterday, I enjoyed a special evening with seven parents of eight autistic children. These parents shared with me their needs, hopes and aspirations for their children into the future. My officials have been examining the matter of long-term service provision for children with autism, particularly in the context of Deputy McGuinness&rsquo;s question regarding the Holy Spirit special school in Kilkenny city and the new facility to be located in a refurbished former school building in Goresbridge in County Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>As Deputy McGuinness observed, the Holy Spirit special school caters for pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with autism. It has an enrolment of 37 pupils and a staffing of seven class teachers and 13 classroom assistants. The building project for the school has been assigned a band one rating by my Department, which is the highest priority rating that can be assigned. A site at Seville Lodge has been purchased for the provision of the new permanent accommodation and architectural planning is proceeding.</P>
        <P>As an interim measure, my Department recently approved the rental of temporary accommodation comprising two classrooms and one sensory integration room for the school to alleviate the current accommodation shortfall. I am unsure from what Deputy McGuinness said whether this temporary accommodation is working out well. The Department is finalising its deliberations on the current and future enrolment levels for the school with a view to determining the accommodation brief. The Department will be in touch with the school authorities as it works through this process. As with all special schools, Holy Spirit special school provides an invaluable service in catering for the needs of pupils with special needs in the area and it is a priority to <Col N="116"/>ensure that the scheme is progressed and that departmental deliberations are concluded as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>All building projects in the schools building programme are considered in the context of the budgetary and Estimates process. Applications for special needs accommodation command a high priority rating in line with the agreed criteria for prioritising large scale projects. The ranking applied to all special schools in the building programme will heavily and positively influence the timescale for delivery of special needs projects.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGuinness referred to the project to develop a facility for the education of autistic children in Goresbridge. This centre will be based on the existing education facility in County Kildare which uses the Saplings model. As Deputy McGuinness observed, the Saplings approach is one component of ABA. From speaking to parents of autistic children, I know that many place great store on this approach and feel it helps their children to develop educationally. The contract was placed on 10 September 2004 in the amount of &euro;253,105, including VAT, to carry out refurbishment works at the school. Departmental officials are of the view that this work will be completed before Christmas. This is not the situation Deputy McGuinness presented so further examination may be required. A pre-Christmas completion was, however, the hope and intention of the Department in placing this contract.</P>
        <P>Discussions regarding annual funding and staffing levels based on one-to-one staffing support for the facility are ongoing. This will be done in conjunction with the providers of the service. All costs and issues relating to staffing levels required for the project will be finalised prior to the completion of the current refurbishment works. My Department recognises the crucial nature of an early intervention programme for autistic children and is conscious to ensure that the children who are to avail of this facility should not lose out while they are waiting. In this regard, funding is provided for a system of home tuition for children on the waiting list. If families are experiencing difficulties such as those outlined by Deputy McGuinness, the special needs section in the Department will be happy to work with those parents to ensure their children&rsquo;s needs are met on an interim basis pending the opening of the school.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this important and sensitive issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 was published in June 2004, fulfilling a commitment given by Government in December last, following its review of arrangements relating to dormant accounts funding. At that time, the Government committed itself to maintaining an open, transparent and accountable process for dealing with applications for dormant accounts funding. These commitments have been honoured in the Bill in the following ways: the objectives of the disbursements scheme will remain unchanged; disbursements will continue to be within the framework of objectives and priorities set out in the dormant accounts disbursements plan; application processes for dormant accounts <Col N="118"/>funding will be transparent and publicised; decisions on disbursements will be made and publicised by Government; appropriate arrangements will be put in place so that the spend from the dormant accounts fund is separate and additional; and the future role of the board will focus on preparation of the disbursements plan, reviewing progress in achieving objectives and assessing the additionality and impact of spend. The Bill has completed Second and Committee Stages in the Seanad and the draft legislation will continue its passage through the Oireachtas shortly and be enacted in due course.</P>
        <P>With regard to concerns raised, one of the main reasons the Government decided to review arrangements is to ensure that the focus of spending from the fund is consistent with policy priorities debated in this House and approved by Government. If we are serious about tackling disadvantage, we must ensure that available resources are targeted in a particularly focused and sustained manner. I am satisfied the draft legislation provides that decisions made by Government will be based on transparent assessment criteria and will not be influenced by other factors.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding and supports to the Inishowen area from a number of sources. The Inishowen partnership board delivers the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, in its area. This programme aims to counter disadvantage and promote equality and social and economic partnership. Funding of &euro;695,524 was allocated to the partnership under LDSIP in 2004 to support actions under the three submeasures of the programme &mdash; services for the unemployed, community development and community-based youth initiatives. Inishowen Partnership also operates a jobs club in three separate locations in Inishowen which provides a range of options for people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>With regard to the community development programme, CDP, Action Inishowen is funded by my Department at a level of &euro;92,000 per annum to concentrate on social development throughout the Inishowen peninsula. It is part of a strong network of projects all over the county, which act as community development resource projects or centres in communities affected by high unemployment. The target groups identified by Action Inishowen include the elderly, youth, long-term unemployed, early school leavers, children of separated, divorced and-or deceased parents, lone <Col N="119"/>parents, people with disabilities and low income farm families. Under the scheme of grants for <Col N="120"/>locally based community projects, funding was recently announced to the following five projects in Inishowen:</P><Col N="119"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy is under way. The review is examining the progress made to date in implementing the strategy and it will enable priorities for future action to be identified &mdash; and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary &mdash; for the remaining period up to 2008. The review will also examine the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland, including emerging trends, and will identify any gaps presenting and how they might be addressed.</P>
        <P>The review is being overseen by a steering group chaired by my Department, which comprises representatives from a number of Departments and agencies involved in implementing the strategy as well as the community and voluntary sectors. PA Consulting Group is assisting the steering group in its ongoing work. A comprehensive consultation process has been undertaken as part of the review. Presentations from more than 25 Departments, agencies and voluntary and <Col N="121"/>community groups involved in delivering the strategy were made to the steering group during September and early October, most of which I attended. Five regional seminars also took place in October in Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin. The sessions were attended by members of the public as well as representatives from statutory agencies, Departments, community and voluntary groups, regional and local drug task forces and public representatives. I was happy to attend all the regional sessions and to partake in discussions. Focus groups involving young people were also held during October in Galway, Sligo, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin. A total of 117 written submissions to the review have been received to date.</P>
        <P>The consultation process has enabled us to get a broad and varied perspective on the strategy and what its future direction should be. PA Consulting are synthesising and evaluating the views received and they will be reporting to the steering group by mid-December. Following consideration of the various issues by the steering group, I will make recommendations on the way forward to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. I expect the review to be completed early next year.</P>

	<P>I envisage that the RAPID programme will operate on a number of different levels in tandem in future. Many small-scale proposals from RAPID areas are being dealt with more effectively at local level. I have put in place a dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million in 2004 to help progress these proposals and support this approach. These proposals are being co-funded by the relevant Department or local agency under a number of categories, with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;2 million is being provided for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme. This scheme is being operated by the local authorities and is being funded on a euro for euro basis &mdash;&euro;1 million from my Department and &euro;1 million from the local authorities through the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Each of the strand I and strand II RAPID areas received total allocations of &euro;60,000 and &euro;40,000 respectively. Funding of &euro;3 million is being provided for the current year to support the development of playgrounds in RAPID areas &mdash;&euro;1.5 million from my Department and &euro;1.5 million from the Department of Health and Children. Each of the strand I and strand II RAPID areas received total allocations of &euro;72,000 and &euro;60,000 respectively. The local authority, in consultation with the relevant area implementation team, AIT, selected the projects to be supported under both schemes.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;2.2 million in top-up funding has been allocated to 73 projects in RAPID areas, which were successful under the sports capital programme 2004. All successful projects that were endorsed by the AIT were considered for top-up funding, with up to 30% additional funding being provided by my Department, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of project cost or the amount requested by the applicant. The <Col N="123"/>roll out of these co-funding measures is continuing and it is hoped to make further announcements regarding same in the near future.</P>
        <P>The larger projects from RAPID plans that have been submitted to Departments will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect Departments will deal with a smaller number of projects and will, therefore, be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions. Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will also continue, as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.</P>
        <P>Special provision was made by the Government for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. Under the women&rsquo;s equality measure, &euro;7 million out of &euro;12 million of the funds has been reserved for RAPID areas. Discussions are ongoing with Departments regarding prioritisation of other non capital actions included in the AIT plans.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to expand the RAPID programme geographically. However, Ballyfermot met the criteria for inclusion in strand I of the RAPID programme but was omitted due to its inclusion in the URBAN II programme. I am examining this apparent anomaly.</P>

	<P>It has always been my intention that participants on the rural social scheme should retain their entitlement to medical cards and other secondary benefits and, indeed, have the same entitlements as community employment workers. My Department has made a case to the chief executive officers group of the health boards regarding medical cards and they have accepted, in principle, that payments under the scheme will be treated the same as payments to those on community employment. Confirmation of this from the Department of Health and Children is expected soon.</P>
        <P>The only other case that has arisen in terms of secondary benefits relates to the fuel allowance. Those on the rural social scheme who claim fuel allowance receive it is as part of their normal weekly payment under the scheme. The Christmas bonus will also be paid to participants on the rural social scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>When I established Comhairle na Tuaithe in February 2004, I identified several specific aims and objectives for this group, including the development of a national countryside recreation strategy, and the identification of appropriate mechanisms for resolving issues of access to and responsible enjoyment of the countryside, including access to recognised walking routes. The work of Comhairle na Tuaithe is supported by funding I made available from the rural development fund, including support for the appointment of a research-development officer.</P>
        <P>Comhairle na Tuaithe has established working groups to address specific required outputs to achieve its work programme. These groups are working on the examination of the issues surrounding access to the countryside; the development of a national countryside recreation strategy; and the development of a countryside code. Comhairle na Tuaithe has arranged a national conference to be held in November to promote and develop its work including the areas specifically outlined above. This event will serve as an opportunity to progress the development of a countryside recreation strategy. I will pursue with my colleagues in Government action, which may be necessary, arising out of the results of the ongoing processes outlined.</P>

	<P>As I announced on 14 <Col N="125"/>July 2004 on behalf of the Government, a process of discussions has been initiated with the other EU member states and the EU institutions with a view to seeking official and working language status for the Irish language in the EU under EEC Regulation 1/1958. The regulation is the legal instrument that governs the EU institutions&rsquo; official and working language regime. The focus in these ongoing discussions, which are taking place at official level, with representatives of the other member states and EU institutions is on securing agreement on the practical modalities in relation to this objective. As our relationship with the EU institutions and other member states is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the discussions are led by that Department.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 230 on 5 October, once these official level discussions have progressed sufficiently to clarify the practical options and issues arising in achieving this objective, the matter will return formally to Government. The Deputy will understand why it would not be appropriate for me to make a public comment on the detail of these discussions until they have been brought to a conclusion.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 96 and 105 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a broad range of measures to support the voluntary sector, including schemes that provide once-off grant support and others which offer multi-annual funding, normally over a three-year period. My Department will provide in excess of &euro;31 million in grants to community development projects, CDPs, and supports to community groups this year. This amount includes allocations as part of multi-annual funding to CDPs. In addition, my Department is providing &euro;42.1 million in support of local <Col N="126"/>development. The bulk of this amount is also payable in the context of multi-annual funding to area based partnerships and community partnerships, based on three-year renewable contracts. Funding for LEADER groups is also provided on a multi-annual basis.</P>
        <P>I announced the successful applicants for two funding initiatives arising from the White Paper in September 2003 &mdash; the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector and the funding scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. Both schemes operate on a multi-annual basis with successful applicants receiving total funding of &euro;5.48 million in respect of the federations and networks scheme and &euro;1.83 million in respect of the training and supports scheme over a three-year period.</P>

        <Quest>if, having regard to his previously expressed concerns on rural depopulation and difficulties in regard to one off housing development in rural Ireland, he has satisfied himself that current building regulations adequately address the issues involved; if he plans further initiatives in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. The national spatial strategy addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, agrees it is vitally important that there should be certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy on rural housing through their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation. On 4 March, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, published the consultation draft of guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing. These draft guidelines are vitally important so that there is clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning auth<Col N="127"/>orities of Government policy in on rural housing. They provide a more detailed framework for planners, based on what the national spatial strategy has to say on rural housing policy.</P>
        <P>The guidelines reflect what I have been saying for the past number of years. As I said in my statement at the time welcoming the publication of the draft guidelines, rural housing within the confines of good planning practice is needed. The consultation process has been concluded and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expects to publish the definitive guidelines later in the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 267 together.</P><Col N="129"/>
        <P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board has engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer this initial round of funding on its behalf and the process of assessing and approving applications received is ongoing. The Government announced in June 2004 an increase in the overall amount that the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board may spend from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million under the initial round of funding. To date, the board has approved 318 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;30 million. Over the coming months, further allocations will be made by the board up to a total figure of &euro;60 million.</P>
        <P>The bulk of dormant accounts funding is initially being targeted at areas designated as disadvantaged, that is, RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas. Within those parameters, it is anticipated that a balanced regional distribution of funding will be achieved when the board has allocated the full amount available for disbursement under this round of funding. The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 was published on 24 June 2004 fulfilling a commitment given by Government in December last following its review of arrangements in relation to dormant accounts funding. The Bill proposes key changes to the role of the board and in relation to decision making on disbursements. The Bill is before the Oireachtas. Subject to its enactment, a further round of applications for funding may be anticipated during 2005.</P>

        <P>Under the community development programme, funding is targeted at the support of disadvantaged and socially excluded communities. The network of 175 community development resource centres and projects consists of both locally-based communities and communities of interest. A number of projects with a national remit are receiving funding under the programme, including the national Traveller women&rsquo;s forum, the Bosnian CDP, the senior citizens parliament and Interaction. In addition, funding is also provided to Women&rsquo;s Aid, Pavee Point and the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism towards the specialist support needs of projects in the programme.</P>

	<P>My Department does not fund community councils. However, we fund the community development programme, CDP. The CDP supports locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities so that they can contribute to a process of change in their areas and improve the quality of life of their communities. The CDP remit is to maintain an anti-poverty-anti-exclusion-anti-discrimination focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty, exclusion and discrimination at all levels within the programme. A total of 175 projects are participating in the programme in urban and rural areas with a further 15 in the process of establish<Col N="153"/>ment. The total funding allocated in 2004 to the programme was &euro;20.6 million.</P>

	<P>One of the functions of Waterways Ireland, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, is to examine the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal. No decision has been taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ulster Canal. A study was commissioned which estimated the cost of the restoration of the full canal at approximately £90 million Sterling based on costs in 2000. The issues arising in regard to the Ulster Canal, including the question of whether a phased or partial approach to the matter might be feasible, are being considered by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North. The Deputy will appreciate that the question of allocating funding does not arise at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. The agreed programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CL&Aacute;R programme and I announced these on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties, amounting to a total population of 361,000, are included in the programme.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments are made through a series of more than 20 measures, which support physical, economic and social infrastructure such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village, housing and schools enhancement, health, broadband and sports and community projects. The measures reflect the priorities iden<Col N="154"/>tified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the start of the programme.</P>
        <P>The measures were agreed with and are operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas. I intend to continue this practice for new measures I may introduce, depending on identified needs. Equally, I will keep the operation of existing measures under review.</P>
        <P>The merits of this practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. Expenditure amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002 and &euro;8.613 million in 2003 which, it is estimated, secured a further &euro;21 million in related public and private expenditure in these areas, which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. To date in 2004, more than &euro;19 million has been allocated to the counties in CL&Aacute;R under the various measures operating under the programme. A number of measures operate on a two-year cycle, 2004 and 2005, and this is reflected in the funding allocated. The bulk of the approved funding in 2004 for other areas will not fall for payment in the same year, for example, top-up funding under the 2004 sports capital programme.</P>

	<P>Under the area based rural development initiative, my Department provides some &euro;30 million in funding for rural-agri-tourism over the period 2000 to 2006. This funding is made available to rural communities through their local Leader companies. The objectives of this funding include the development and enhancement of the rural-agri-tourism product range in an environmentally and sustainable way and the promotion and development of rural-agri-tourism in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the regional tourism authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides a number of other supports to rural or agri-tourism including sponsorship of the national rural tourism awards, funding the western development tourism programme aimed at developing areas in the western counties which are underperforming in terms of tourism and the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe in relation to the development of a countryside recreation strategy.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?>
        <P>Agri-tourism plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the rural economy. Work is under way on advancing performance indicators for various areas relating to the work of my Department. Matters such as the value to the economy of agri-tourism will be considered.</P>

	<P>I introduced a scheme for the refurbishment of courthouses in CL&Aacute;R areas in 2003, for which funding of &euro;300,000 was <Col N="156"/>made available for 2003-04. The scheme is funded on the basis of &euro;1 from CL&Aacute;R to every &euro;2 from the Courts Service. The refurbishment works cover replacing windows and doors, painting, repairs to footpaths, general clean-up of grounds and minor improvements.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;50,000 was approved for Clifden Courthouse, County Galway, in October 2004 to enable interior refurbishment works of &euro;150,000 to proceed. Works being carried out by the OPW are expected to be completed by end 2004. </P>

	<P>The scheme in question initially provided for an annual grant of up to a maximum of &euro;130,000 to community-based Gaeltacht organisations over a three-year period to assist in the preparation and implementation of an Irish language plan within their areas of operation. A total of &euro;1.56 million was provided for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Applications received under the scheme were assessed according to the following criteria: the fulfilment of the various conditions outlined in the application procedure; the manner in which the applicant intended to pursue and achieve the objectives of the project; the capacity and suitability of the organisation to carry out the project; the experience and competence of the organisation in the preparation and implementation of an appropriate language plan in the Gaeltacht; the level and appropriateness of the resources available for the project; value for money and overall cost to the Department on an annual basis. A total of three people &mdash; two from my own Department and one from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &mdash; were involved in the evaluation of all applications received.</P>
        <P>With regard to monitoring, it is intended that a language manager will be recruited in each case who will be responsible in the first instance to a local steering committee. This committee will include representatives of the local community, representatives of the organisation itself as well as regional officials from my Department and from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and will meet on a regular basis to monitor progress. The various steering committees will then report periodically to a high level steering committee, which will include senior representatives of the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>This is a pilot scheme introduced by my Department this year as a result of the recommendations in the report of Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta. The provision of further funding will depend on the success of this initiative in meeting the goals set out in the various plans.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 142 and 231 of 5 October 2004, the progress of decentralisation in all Departments is guided by the overall implementation process being carried out centrally by the decentralisation implementation group. In that context, the following steps have been taken by my Department to advance the decentralisation process: a dedicated decentralisation unit was set up to manage the programme. The unit is staffed by a higher executive officer and a clerical officer, who report to the personnel officer. This unit has prepared and distributed to staff an information pack which includes a wide range of information on decentralisation areas relating to my Department&rsquo;s remit. The unit issues regular bulletins to staff with the most up to date information available on decentralisation and all documentation relating to the issue is made available on the public folders of my Department&rsquo;s e-mail system. A departmental decentralisation committee has been established to steer the decentralisation process within the Department. Membership of the committee is made up of senior management and staff. A liaison officer has been appointed to facilitate communication between the Department of Finance and my Department. Special meetings of my Department&rsquo;s partnership committee are held to specifically address issues arising from decentralisation and use is made of such meetings to ensure staff are kept informed on all aspects of the decentralisation process. There is regular communication between my Department and staff associations through the departmental council process.</P>
        <P>In addition, work is in hand regarding the establishment of systems for job analysis and process mapping for each function within my Department to facilitate effective transfers of staff in the future. An initial decentralisation implementation plan for my Department has been prepared and submitted to the decentralisation implementation group. The September 2004 data obtained from the CAF system indicates that 159 civil servants and nine public servants have lodged applications for or expressed an interest in decentralisation to Knock Airport. The number of staff required by my Department for that location is 159.9.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 130, 272 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. My Department also has responsibility for the work of 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, which were established in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin.</P>
        <P>To date, more than &euro;80 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their two rounds of local action plans. A broad range of community-based projects are being supported in areas such as treatment, prevention, education etc., through these plans. A further &euro;12.8 million has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. In addition, approximately &euro;75 million has been allocated to support the work of the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres. The main aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
        <P>My Department also has responsibility for the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, which was established in July 2000 to advise the Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland based on the analysis of research findings and information available to it. The NACD launched a community-voluntary sector research grant scheme to generate innovative, community-based drugs research in December 2001. Arising from this scheme, four research studies were published in September last. Ballymun youth action project undertook a study on the role of benzodiazepines in the development of substance misuse problems in Ballymun Kilbarrack coast community programme examined the issue of drug misuse among ten to 17 year olds in the Kilbarrack area. Merchants Quay Ireland examined drug use among new communities in Ireland. Tallaght homeless advice unit explored the links between homelessness and drug use. The findings of these studies are being examined by various Departments and will also be considered by my Department in the context of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>I refer to funding for drugs work. The Estimates process for 2005 is ongoing and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Finance in this regard. While the Deputies will appreciate that the allocations for <Col N="161"/>my Department for next year have not been finalised, I assure them that tackling drug misuse remains a priority for this Government and it is my intention that significant resources will continue to be targeted at this problem.</P>

	<P>I have undertaken a wide range of initiatives in support of rural communities. These include establishment and expansion of the CL&Aacute;R programme; establishment of the rural social scheme; small food producers forum and co-ordinator; Comhairle na Tuaithe; and a review of enterprise supporting rural areas. In addition, my Department continues to oversee the delivery of programmes which support rural communities. These comprise the Leader programme; rural development fund; PEACE II programme; rural initiative measure of INTERREG; farm relief services; local development and social inclusion programme; community development programme; and Gaeltacht and island development.</P>
        <P>Details on each of the foregoing are set out in the following appendix:</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Appendix</i>
        </P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties, amounting to a total population of 361,000, are included in the programme. CL&Aacute;R funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments are made through a series of more than 20 measures that support physical, economic and social infrastructure such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village, housing and schools enhancement, health, broadband and sports and community projects. The measures reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the start of the programme and were agreed with and are operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Expenditure amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002 and &euro;8.613 million in 2003 which, it is estimated, secured a further &euro;21 million in related public and private expenditure in these areas which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. To date in 2004, more than &euro;19 million has been allo<Col N="162"/>cated to the counties in CL&Aacute;R under the various programme measures.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I launched the rural social scheme in May of this year. The aims of the scheme are to provide services of benefit to rural communities by harnessing the skills and talents available among low income farmers and fishermen and income support to low income farmers and fishermen who are in receipt of specified, primarily long-term, social welfare payments. I hosted a small food producers forum in Maynooth in November 2003 to support small food producers and those working with them. A number of topics were raised at this forum, including co-ordination between small food producers and statutory agencies, training bodies etc.; training and technical support; access to markets; food safety issues and testing, assessment and waste disposal; the regulatory environment; access to information; and product promotion, branding and accreditation. The European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. David Byrne, spoke at the forum.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My Department is financially supporting the appointment of a small food producers co-ordinator, working with Comhar Leader na h&Eacute;ireann, who will endeavour to tackle the barriers inhibiting small food producers, ranging from the scale of the enterprise, access to funding and distribution, marketing and promotion as well as the provision of skills training and the regulatory environment.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I established Comhairle na Tuaithe in February 2004. It includes representatives of farmer, recreational users, tourism marketing bodies and other interested groups. Comhairle na Tuaithe is working on conflict resolution on access to the countryside, the development of a countryside code and a countryside recreation strategy. A national conference organised by Comhairle na Tuaithe will take place on 19 November.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I have initiated a review of enterprise support in rural areas in conjunction with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My Department is responsible for the implementation of the Leader programmes, the rural social scheme, the rural development aspects of the cross-Border programmes, PEACE and INTERREG and the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The rural measures under these programmes promote the development of rural areas and strengthen the rural communities within them.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Leader is the European Union initiative for rural development, which provides approved local action groups with public funding &mdash; EU and domestic &mdash; to implement multisectoral business plans for the development of their own areas. In accordance with the bottom-up <Col N="163"/>philosophy of rural development, the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan. The approval of grants by groups is made within detailed operating rules drawn up by the Department and approved by the European Commission. Leader is being delivered in two ways during the current Structural Fund period 2000 to 2006: the EU Initiative, Leader +, and the area based rural development programme &mdash; Leader&mdash; funded under the Border, midland and west and southern and eastern regional operational programmes. Public co-funding of theses programmes, amounting to &euro;150 million, has been allocated to the new Leader programmes over the period.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am also supporting a number of pilot projects from my Department&rsquo;s rural development fund to regenerate particularly disadvantaged rural areas through a variety of community initiatives. Payments totalling &euro;266,000 have been paid to these projects to date in 2004.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The cross-Border rural development measures of the PEACE II programme aim to promote agriculture and rural development co-operation in the Border area. The rural initiative measure of the INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland programme is aimed at encouraging rural businesses and communities to engage in the development of their area. Financial support is also provided to rural communities under the INTERREG Ireland-Wales programme for rural development and diversification activities within the programme&rsquo;s eligible area.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My Department also provides funding to the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The funding is primarily aimed at training of farm relief operatives and staff with smaller elements for infrastructure and research and development. Funding of &euro;42.144 million is available for the local development and social inclusion programme in 2004. This programme operates in both rural and urban areas and aims to counter disadvantage and promote equality and social and economic inclusion through the provision of funding and support to local partnerships and community groups.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My Department also supports, on a multiannual basis, 47 locally-based projects, which are involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in rural communities. This support is provided by way of core funding through the community development programme. Projects funded under the programme provide support to disadvantaged communities geared towards improving their capacity to benefit from economic and social development.</P><Col N="164"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Department will spend up to &euro;10.5 million in 2004 on the development of capital infrastructure on the islands. In addition, a total of &euro;2.5 million will be spent on providing essential transport services between the islands and the mainland. In addition to current funding of &euro;10.193 million, capital funding of &euro;22 million has been made available to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2004 to enable it to achieve its objectives of developing the economy of the Gaeltacht and encouraging the preservation and extension of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s also promotes and supports community development and pursues a range of language and cultural activities involving individuals, community groups and industries throughout the Gaeltacht.</P>

	<P el="0">The current best estimate publication date for the draft legislation on charities regulation is the end of 2005. The most up-to-date information on progress is always available on the charities regulation web page of my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.pobail.ie/en/<?oasys _jy?>Charities Regulation/</i>. The content of the draft legislation is likely to reflect the proposals contained in the Government approved consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities, which received a broad overall endorsement in the public consultation earlier this year. The draft legislation will be substantial, given that, as signalled in the consultation paper, it will involve statute law revision and restatement in addition to the new legislative provisions to regulate the charities sector.</P>

	<P>Planning permission is a matter for the local authorities that have responsibility for Gaeltacht areas or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000. This Act outlines the need to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language. It is essential that all State agencies function in a manner that supports the Irish language in the Gaeltacht in every way.</P>

	<P>As part of a comprehensive community oriented psychiatric service, persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated in their own health board area. Where inpatient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units or the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital. Outpatient services are provided from hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. In addition, a tertiary referral service <Col N="168"/>for eating disorders is available in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, where three inpatient beds are designated for this purpose. A similar service is available privately at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, James&rsquo;s Street, Dublin 8, and at St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin.</P>
        <P>At present, psychiatric inpatient services for children and adolescents under 16 years of age are provided in Warrenstown House, Dublin, and St. Anne&rsquo;s, Taylors Hill, in Galway. Project teams have been established to progress the development of new child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric units in Cork, Galway, Limerick and at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Fairview, in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. Approval was recently given by the Department of Health and Children to the relevant health board to proceed with the selection of a design team for the proposed units in Cork, Galway and Limerick. It is envisaged that the focus of these centres will be the assessment and treatment of psychiatric, emotional or family disorders, including eating disorders, using a combination of family systemic, individual psycho-dynamic and medical model perspectives.</P>
        <P>The internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. Since 1997, additional funding of almost &euro;19 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 19 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, there are now 52 such psychiatrists employed.</P>
        <P>An expert group on mental health policy is preparing a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future. The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including those services for persons with an eating disorder, will be considered in the context of the work of the group. It is expected that the expert group will report in 2005.</P>

	<P>The terms of reference of the post mortem inquiry require it to review post mortem policy, practice and procedure in all hospitals in the State since 1970, with particular reference to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal. The inquiry is also mandated to examine any arrangements with pharmaceutical companies regarding retained organs, including pituitary glands.</P>
        <P>The chairman has confirmed that the inquiry has received considerable co-operation from each of the hospitals with which it is dealing and that the inquiry&rsquo;s non-statutory nature has not thus far significantly hampered its substantive work. The chairman has indicated that she will provide a report on paediatric hospitals in December 2004. There are ongoing consultations with the inquiry about the other elements of its remit, having <Col N="170"/>regard to the Government decision that the inquiry should conclude by 31 March next.</P>
        <P>Pending receipt of the chairman&rsquo;s report, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the actions of specific pharmaceutical companies. I am advised that individual hospitals have adopted differing policies on the question of contacting next of kin of deceased persons whose organs were retained.</P>
        <P>At the end of August 2004, the inquiry had incurred direct expenditure of &euro;11,577,610. This includes fees to the inquiry&rsquo;s legal team and costs associated with the establishment and rental or administration of the inquiry office. My Department has also provided funding to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Parents for Justice in respect of inquiry &mdash; related expenditure amounting to &euro;6,780,424.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following requests from my Department earlier this year, health boards have provided some information regarding plans or proposals to dispose of lands and properties between now and the coming into force of the new Health Service Executive. These proposals largely relate to a number of small holdings of lands and property which are deemed to be surplus to requirements and would, therefore, be appropriate for disposal. In this context, I have asked my Department to provide the Deputy <Col N="172"/>with the details of the more significant proposals being considered.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Health (Amendment) Act 2004, my consent is now required before health boards can sell or otherwise dispose of lands. I can confirm that since these proposals have not yet materialised in the form of actual transactions to dispose of the lands in question, I have not to date provided my consent to such proposals.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the proceeds from the sale of any particular land or properties in the health area will be applied and used for health purposes, with the exception of contributions of lands to the social and affordable housing initiatives. I am also concerned that we now establish the extent of the total surplus land and properties available in the health service. In that context, it will be necessary to carry out a professional assessment/evaluation of the entire health estate in the near future.</P>

	<P>In accordance with health strategy objectives, the Government&rsquo;s immediate focus is on the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times for inpatient and day case treatments in acute hospitals. This is being facilitated by the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the management and monitoring of patients waiting for outpatient appointments rests with the individual hospitals and health boards concerned. It is a matter for each hospital to prioritise its services based on patient need and use its available resources to best effect to ensure that patient services are delivered efficiently and effectively. The issue of expanding the remit of the NTPF to include outpatient waiting lists will be kept under review.</P>

My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the issues raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>
        <P>Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine departments reflect system-wide issues. It is, therefore, necessary to take a whole system approach, involving primary care, acute care, sub-acute and community care, in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments. I am currently identifying the particular pressure points within the health system that affect the efficient delivery of emergency services. I intend to ensure that the most pressing problems are addressed as a matter of urgency and, in the context of the upcoming Estimates, I intend to introduce a wide ranging package of measures that will address these problems.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposed public private partnership, PPP, project in the Southern Health Board. The project is for eight 50-bed community nursing units, CNUs, and one of these units will be located on a site adjacent to Bantry General Hospital, which is in the ownership of the Southern Health Board. The CNU will provide respite, convalescence, long stay and rehabilitation services to elderly patients in the area. It is not intended to provide a day care centre as part of this development. It is a priority to increase the availability of community nursing and other units that would meet the needs of people who need care that could not be adequately provided at home.</P>
        <P>There have been discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance in the development of this PPP scheme, as is normal and entirely appropriate with a PPP project. As PPPs are complex schemes, it is important to have a clear view of the benefits that will accrue given the complexity of the PPP contracting structure. The work that has been done so far has helped to clarify a number of issues. I intend to examine this project in detail very soon. The put<Col N="174"/>ting in place of a large number of nursing units will greatly help people make the transition from an acute hospital setting to care matched to their needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 160, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Applications for inter-country adoption are processed by health boards under the Adoption Acts 1952-1998. The length of time it takes to complete the necessary assessment and the allocation of resources within the health board is a matter for the management of each individual health board. However, I have asked the Adoption Board to identify practical measures to tackle the waiting lists for inter-country assessments and it is examining this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier this year, my Department requested health boards to provide it with detailed schedules of all proposals regarding planned disposal of property. The sale of assets in the health area will be used for health purposes, with the exception of a contribution towards social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The information received from the health boards in response to this request is being examined at present. Among the matters to be considered in this context is the fulfilment of my Department&rsquo;s obligations in respect of the provision of lands for affordable housing. I believe it would be inappropriate to provide further details in advance of the completion of this process. With regard to establishing the extent of the total surplus properties available to the health services, it will be necessary to carry out a professional assessment or evaluation of the entire health estate. This issue will be addressed by a group of senior officials in my Department in the near future.</P>
        <P>With regard to Newcastle Hospital, I am informed by the East Coast Area Health Board that consideration is being given to the development of a number of new health service facilities on the lands of Newcastle Hospital. Technical staff have been asked to formulate an overall development plan for the site. Subsequent to the production of this overall plan, the question of residual property will be reviewed in the context of health services priorities for the region.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>In 2002, as part of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, approximately 12.6 million iodine tablets were distributed by post to households nationwide. Each household received a packet containing six potassium iodate tablets BP85mg, which is sufficient to provide a single dose for each member of an average sized household.</P>
        <P>The tablets were aluminium foil blister packed and sealed in a carton containing an information and instruction leaflet. Each carton delivered by An Post was in a sealed firm envelope labelled with appropriate warning statements and the name and address of the recipient. A public notice was placed in national newspapers at the time advising persons that these tablets were medicinal products and that they should be stored in a cool dry place, in their original sealed container and out of reach of children. While all medicines should be stored safely, I am advised that there is no significant risk from these tablets given that the average household will only hold one carton containing six tablets.</P>
        <P>A further 1.6 million iodine tablets were distributed to health boards for persons who did not receive a supply of tablets or who did not receive a sufficient number of tablets via the postal distribution. Persons who do not have a supply of tab<Col N="179"/>lets for any reason should contact their local health board and arrange for the collection of the <Col N="180"/>tablets required. The following table sets out relevant contact details.</P><Col N="179"/>

	<P>A bursary model for supporting postgraduate clinical psychology training was adopted to underpin the implementation of a key recommendation of the union-management joint review group on psychological services in the health services to substantially increase the number of training places in clinical psychology from 30 to 50 and support the establishment of <Col N="184"/>new courses at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick. This increase in training places will help meet the long-term human resource needs of the health service for clinical psychologists and is, therefore, of significant benefit to those who need to avail of psychological services. The bursary model is also intended to secure the best return on the significant resources invested in the training of clinical psychologists.</P>
        <P>The terms of the bursary model were agreed jointly by my Department with the health boards&rsquo; directors of human resources group in August 2003. It assists students undertaking postgraduate training in clinical psychology by providing each student with an untaxed bursary payment of &euro;18,000 per annum, along with an annual contribution towards fees of &euro;6,000 for the three years of the course, that is, a total contribution of &euro;24,000 per annum. I understand this level of financial support compares favourably to that available to postgraduate students generally.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a national plan for postgraduate clinical psychology training, some students were previously employed as trainee clinical psychologists on a salary scale with a multiplicity of arrangements in place to fund course fees ranging from the deduction of fees from the pre-tax salary to payment of full fees. These arrangements were put in place at a time when the limited number of training places severely restricted access to postgraduate courses in clinical psychology. The introduction of the bursary model is, therefore, facilitating a substantial improvement in access to training through the development of new courses to the benefit of prospective students. It is also intended to contribute to a significant improvement in the volume of psychological services provided to the public by training the increased personnel required to reduce the current high level of vacancies for clinical psychologists in the health service.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that discussions have taken place with representatives of the IMPACT national vocational group and the professional body regarding the introduction of the new model. However, it has not proved possible to reach agreement and, following a conciliation conference held by the Labour Relations Commission, the matter has now been referred to the Labour Court.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The chief executive officer of each health board or authority is responsible for the management of the workforce in his or her region, including decisions on the type of contract, permanent or temporary, under which staff are employed.</P>
        <P>Temporary nurses have always been a feature of the health service and the employment of such qualified staff is not considered detrimental to service delivery. There are a number of reasons that some nurses are employed on a temporary basis in the public health service. Temporary nurses may replace permanent nurses who are absent from their post while on career break, maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave and so forth; overseas nurses may initially be employed on temporary contracts; recent nursing graduates are usually employed in a temporary capacity for the first 12 months of employment; and some nurses choose to remain on temporary contracts rather than apply for permanent positions.</P>
        <P>Temporary nurses are eligible to apply for permanent posts as they arise. The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 ensures that temporary employees are not treated less favourably than colleagues who have permanent appointments. The Act also provides that temporary employees in their fourth or subsequent year of continuous employment are in most cases entitled to permanent status.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board or authority other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services <Col N="186"/>for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board or authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. The last such increase was notified in January 2004.</P>
        <P>Health board or authority chief executive officers have discretion in issuing medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>With regard to investment income and capital generally, health board staff take interest from savings and the amount of capital available into consideration in the assessment of means for a medical card, which is routinely carried out by a community welfare officer, CWO. Additionally the issue of the treatment of SSIA proceeds in the assessment of means for a medical card is under consideration with a view to ensuring that nobody is disadvantaged under the scheme. The chief executive officers of the boards-authority are reviewing numerous issues regarding the administration of the medical card scheme and I understand that their findings and recommendations will be available in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position. In line with the health strategy, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</P>

Relief is also available for capital expenditure on plant and machinery used for the purposes of a trade. In addition, tax relief for certain tourist facilities is available under certain of the property-based incentive schemes and the business expansion and seed capital schemes.</P>
        <P>Full details on the rural renewal, urban renewal and town renewal schemes, business expansion scheme, seed capital scheme and the relief for significant buildings are available from the Revenue Commissioners website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> in the &ldquo;Leaflets and Guides&rdquo; section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is studying the situation with regard to endowment loan shortfalls, having commenced a survey earlier this year, to determine whether and to what extent there will be difficulties for <Col N="189"/>customers. It would be inappropriate to reach any conclusions on this issue in advance of IFSRA&rsquo;s consideration of the outcome of the survey. I will continue to review the adequacy of the relevant legislative framework as information from IFSRA becomes available.</P>
        <P>There are no reliable data on the overall number of cases where there may be a shortfall. However, endowment loan approvals in the last five years represent just 3% of the overall mortgage market, although it has been considerably higher in the past. Since 1989, a total of 90,000 endowment loans were approved, roughly 10% of total loan approvals since 1989.</P>
        <P>These types of mortgages operate on the basis that instead of making capital payments on a mortgage, the client pays only the interest on the mortgage &mdash; therefore the capital amount owed does not decrease. However, the client also makes an investment with a life assurance company, the aim of which is to cover the mortgage and, possibly, provide some additional benefit beyond that. The products provided additional benefits, for example, in the form of higher tax relief, which were attractive to borrowers. These products inherently require customers to take some risk. They are exposed to market fluctuations, just like any market based life assurance investments. The fact that a person does not gain as much as expected is not in itself an indication of any inappropriate practices on the part of the bank or insurance company concerned.</P>
        <P>The consumer director of IFSRA, Mary O&rsquo;Dea, has encouraged people to come forward if they are worried about the possibility of having been mis-sold an endowment mortgage. They should complain in the first instance to the company from whom they bought the policy.</P>
        <P>As regards the legal framework, there is already a substantial volume of legislation in place relating to these financial products. Following the enactment of the Insurance Act 1989, a code of conduct for insurance intermediaries and guidelines were drawn up by the industry in consultation with the then Department of Industry and Commerce. Key requirements of the code were that the intermediary should know the client and give best advice.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Credit Act 1995, which commenced in May 1996, contains specific provisions relating to endowment loans and, in particular, prescribes certain information which must be included in any application form or information document issued to consumers applying for such loans. Since the commencement of the Act, for example, all endowment loan application forms must contain a prominent notice to the effect that: &ldquo;There is no guarantee that the proceeds of the insurance policy will be sufficient to repay the loan in full when it becomes due for payment.&rdquo; The Act also obliges that in instances where the borrower may be required to increase premium payments on the insurance policy during the lifetime of the loan, any document approving the <Col N="190"/>loan must contain a prominent statement of this possibility. Similarly, obligations apply where a policy is surrendered early resulting in a net loss to the consumer.</P>
        <P>The Act also places an obligation upon insurers underwriting policies relating to endowment loans to issue a statement to the consumer every five years setting out not only the value of the policy at the time of issue but also a comparison of this valuation to the valuation at such date projected at the time the policy was first written and a revised estimate of the valuation at maturity.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations, which came into being in 2001, obliges insurers to provide policy holders, including holders of policies relating to endowment mortgages, with an annual written statement containing <i>inter alia</i> information on the current surrender or maturity value of the policy. More recently, this Government has already considerably enhanced the regulatory and supervisory regime governing the financial services industry, primarily through the enactment of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, which established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority or IFSRA.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 complements the Act passed last year and further enhances IFSRA&rsquo;s powers and strengthens the regulatory environment. This Act will provide for an enhanced structure for dealing with consumers who have complaints about financial institutions and also provides consumer and industry consultative panels for the financial regulator. The consumer panel will have an important role in ensuring that the regulator is correctly reflecting the interests of consumers in its protective &mdash; issue of codes of conduct &mdash; and educational-information pamphlets and so forth &mdash; roles.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The disabled drivers&rsquo; and disabled passengers&rsquo; tax concessions scheme, which applies to certain persons with severe physical disabilities has been in operation since 1968. Its benefits have been considerably enhanced over the period and now involve the following.</P>
        <P>There is relief in respect of vehicle registration tax, VRT, and value added tax, VAT, subject to the following maximum limits: &euro;9,525 for a driver with a disability and &euro;15,875 for a passenger, <Col N="191"/>family member or organisation. Relief is available for a vehicle which has been specially constructed or adapted for use by a person with a disability and which has an engine size of less than 2,000cc in the case of a driver and 4,000cc in the case of a passenger or an organisation which represents persons with disabilities. The cost of the adaptation, in the case of a passenger, must amount to at least 10% of the cost of the vehicle exclusive of VRT. There is repayment of excise duty on fuel used in a vehicle for the transport of a person with a disability up to a maximum of 600 gallons or 2,728 litres per year. These limits are increased to 900 gallons and 4,092 litres for an organisation which represents persons with disabilities. There is exemption from annual road tax.</P>
        <P>The benefits amount to over &euro;5,250 on average per person per year. The scheme is not means-tested and the scale of benefits involved has created demand for the scheme to be extended to cover a much broader range of physical impairments. The scheme, excluding road tax, cost &euro;36 million in 2003, compared with &euro;5 million in 1994. The cost in 2004 of the scheme is expected to be &euro;44 million.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental review group was convened to review the operation of the scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it both on an administrative and user level, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme. The report of the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers&rsquo; and disabled passengers&rsquo;, tax concessions, scheme made a number of recommendations for consideration by the Minister for Finance. In respect of the minimum period of retention of a vehicle, the report recommends that the minimum limits on the period of retention of a vehicle purchased under the scheme, and the frequency of renewal of a subsequent vehicle also purchased under the scheme, should be extended from two years to three years or, alternatively, the level of tax relief should be reduced in the case of second or subsequent applicants.</P>
        <P>The basis for this recommendation is that the frequency of vehicle change is contributing to the ongoing steep rise in the cost of the scheme. The proportion of persons claiming every two years is at least 85%. The report highlights that the review group was not convinced by any evidence that vehicles used by persons with disabilities depreciate at a faster rate than other vehicles to the extent that they need to be replaced every two years. Moreover, the report highlights that a three-year warranty is standard for many makes of cars. Schemes in other countries were examined by the review group and indicate that tax relief or assistance on the purchase of a car is only <Col N="192"/>available after three to seven years use of a vehicle.</P>
        <P>Given the scale and scope of the scheme, changes can only be made after very careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June this year that the Minister for Finance will consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, relief from capital gains tax applies on the transfer of &ldquo;chargeable business assets&rdquo; from parent to child. &ldquo;Chargeable business assets&rdquo; include assets used for the purpose of a trade or profession but exclude assets held as investments. The provision of private residential accommodation is not regarded as a trade or profession for tax purposes. Consequently, gains arising on the transfer, during the lifetime of the parent, of property used for that purpose are chargeable to capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>Section 573 (2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the assets of a deceased person are not deemed to be disposed of by him or her on death. This provision ensures that assets passing from parent to child, on the death of the parent, are not subject to capital gains tax. Relief from capital acquisitions tax for all gifts and inheritances taken on or after 11 April 1994 of relevant business property was introduced in the Finance Act 1994. The relief amounts to a reduction of 90% in respect of the taxable value of relevant business property taken by the beneficiary. However, section 93(3) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 specifically excludes certain types of business, including businesses which consist wholly or mainly of making or holding investments.</P>
        <P>The letting of accommodation, whether on a long or short-term basis, is generally regarded as a business of making or holding investments and is therefore excluded from capital acquisitions tax business relief under section 93(3) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. It is not the practice to comment in the lead up to the <Col N="193"/>annual budget and Finance Bill on the intention or otherwise to make changes in taxation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware the Government decided in September 2004, to implement a number of further key recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. These included a cost neutral early retirement facility which will allow public servants to retire early with actuarially reduced superannuation benefits.</P>
        <P>Under this arrangement, workers whose current minimum pension age is 60 years will be able to avail of the facility from age 50 years and upwards. Those whose minimum pension age is 65 years will be eligible from age 55 years and upwards. The facility is being made available to serving staff and the option will be extended to staff who resigned on or after 1 April 2004, with an entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits. Superannuation benefits in such cases will be based on pensionable service at the time of resignation reduced, on an actuarial basis, to take account of early payment.</P>
        <P>Implementation of this and the other changes announced in September 2004 will commence as soon as detailed guidelines have been prepared and circulated by my Department. My officials are completing work on this aspect, at present. From time to time, early retirement schemes form part of broader policy measures aimed at achieving improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in areas of the public service or in specific public service bodies. However, no such proposals are under consideration at this time.</P>
        <P>With reference to the decentralisation programme as announced in the budget for 2004, the programme will be implemented on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies, nor is any scheme of early retirement envisaged as part of the programme. As on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise.</P>

	<P>I accept that there may be pressure for temporary increases in numbers during the training of staff that are decentralising. However, the process is not intended to create extra costs for the Exchequer. Overall public service numbers will not increase as a result of decentralisation.</P>
        <P>From the start, the policy of capping and reducing public service numbers was to be implemented by natural wastage and without impacting on front line services to the public as far as possible and this remains the case. No specific grades were targeted but it was intended that there would be an even distribution across grades rather than a concentration on lower grades.</P>

	<P>The first report of the decentralisation implementation group sets out a rationale and a recommendation for the public service acquiring space in private sector world- class data centres. It also recommended the establishment of an inter-agency group to progress such a procurement. My Department has established and chairs this group. It comprises senior IT representatives from the large Civil Service Departments and offices and from the justice, health and local authority sectors. It also includes project management experts from the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>The group is considering all issues associated with such a procurement, including the most appropriate procurement approach, the type of facilities and services required, the technology and telecommunications issues involved, possible contract types, potential location options, ownership, management and operation requirements, and any possible security and sovereignty issues that may arise. These are complex issues by their nature and will take some time to work out in detail. The group is working to reach conclusions by the first quarter of 2005.</P>

        <Quest>the estimated gain to the Exchequer by introducing a minimum flat rate of tax of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% respectively to all persons who have gross income in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the estimated gain to the Exchequer from introducing such a minimum flat rate of tax could be calculated, it would be necessary to make a number of assumptions regarding what would be allowed and not allowed, for example, in relation to deductions for the purpose of calculating the tax. Before such a tax could be introduced, it would be necessary to define the gross income to which it would apply and certain issues would arise in relation to that definition. For instance, it would be necessary to decide whether gross income should be defined as income prior to deductions for capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities or superannuation contributions. It would also be necessary to decide whether gross income should include certain other income which is not income for tax purposes or is exempt from tax and how to treat<?oasys _jy?><Col N="199"/><?oasys _fc?>other income sources such as interest income that does not need to be declared or is not recorded but from which tax has been deducted. For these reasons the definition of gross income for the application of such a tax is likely to be different to the gross income figures captured on Revenue&rsquo;s system.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>While there are figures available on the gross income of individuals for the short tax year 2001, the figures on the gross income of individuals in respect of the tax year 2002 and later are not yet available. Estimating the gross income of such individuals and making assumptions regarding the level of their likely allowable deductions would add further unreliability to the estimation exercise. In addition, in attempting to estimate the gain to the Exchequer, it would be necessary to make assumptions regarding the behaviour of individuals in response to the introduction of such a minimum flat rate of tax. Those paying at tax rates in excess of whatever minimum was prescribed would undoubtedly see the new rate as an opportunity for a tax reduction. For these reasons, it is not possible at this time to answer the question in the form sought by the Deputy.</P>

The locations involved are Carlow, Longford, Newcastle West, Athlone, the Curragh, Sligo, Dundalk and Furbo. In regard to Carlow, Longford and Newcastle West, the Chief State Solicitor is processing contract documents in respect of sites and it is expected that the associated acquisition phase will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific goal of the SSIA scheme is to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years. In order to provide an incentive to save for this period, the Exchequer makes a contribution of 25% of the amount that a person saves. This is equivalent to giving a tax credit at the standard rate of income tax in respect of the amount the person saves. This is the mechanism that is used in the legislation to provide for the Exchequer contribution. In effect, the saver is paid a tax credit in respect of an amount of tax that the saver is treated as having paid. Therefore, the Exchequer contribution is not income for tax purposes and is not required to be included in an income tax return.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy to be referring to a mobile phone base station situated on an upper floor of premises which also includes a nursing home. The Deputy has asked a number of questions in recent months concerning mobile phone base stations generally and so he will be aware of my Department&rsquo;s policy in this area. Summarised, this is that no adverse health effects have been proven to have been caused by the kind of non-ionising radiation which is emitted from mobile phone base stations. Ireland participates in a number of international projects which conduct relevant <Col N="207"/>research into this area and my Department continually monitors the latest research to ensure that we have the best and most up-to-date information.</P>
        <P>Limits are set for the allowable electromagnetic emissions from installations such as mobile base stations. These limits are set some 50 to 100 times lower than the experimental levels at which no ill effects have been found. My Department participates in the international process which regularly reviews these limits and validates them as continuing to offer protection to the public. ComReg polices compliance with these limits through the operator licensing process and appropriate measurements.</P>
        <P>In the particular case of an installation on the upper floor of a building, the aerials emit electromagnetic energy laterally away from the aerial installation. It is a fact that the position which receives the lowest emissions from such an installation is directly underneath it. In fact, the residents of the nursing home receive much more electromagnetic emissions from the wiring and the electrical appliances in the building than they do from the base station and such emissions are well within the safety guidelines.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s coast protection programme seeks to address the most urgent instances of erosion on the Irish coastline. Coastal erosion affects all coastal counties and is particularly prevalent on the softer coastline in the east and south east of the country. Allocation of funding for coast protection projects is currently made on the basis of initial project proposals from local authorities, subsequently screened and augmented by my Department&rsquo;s staff on the basis of a small number of selection criteria.</P>
        <P>A value for money report in March 2002 highlighted the need for a more strategic focus in addressing the problem of coastal erosion in Ireland. In this respect, the coastal protection strategy study commenced in 2003. The study will address the nature and extent of erosion at various locations and different types of coastline in Ireland and seek to identify the most effective means, technically, financially and environmentally, in responding to particular instances and types of erosion. It is expected that when this study is completed, a more targeted approach to programme delivery will enable a greater level of efficiency to be achieved.</P>
        <P>Under the coast protection measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, &euro;52.01 million is identified for expenditure. Expenditure under this measure in 2002 was &euro;6.509 million, &euro;2.9 million in 2003 and an allocation of &euro;2.7 mill<Col N="209"/>ion for the coastal protection programme has been made available to my Department in 2004.</P>

	<P>In the year 2000, permission was granted for 1,963 foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland. Permission was granted to the following countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Botswana, Egypt, Germany, France, Greece, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Oman, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Ukraine, the UK and the United States.</P>
        <P>In the year 2001, permission was granted for 1,766 foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland. Permission was granted to the following countries: Algeria, Australia, Belgium Botswana, Egypt, Germany, France, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK, the United States and the Republic of Yemen.</P>
        <P>In the year 2002, permission was granted for 2,460 foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland. Permission was granted to the following countries: Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Botswana, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Israel, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, the UK, the United States and the Republic of Yemen.</P>
        <P>In the year 2003, permission was granted for 3,691 foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland. Permission was granted to the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK and the United States.</P>
        <P>In the year 2004, to date &mdash; 1 January to 31 October &mdash; permission has been granted for 3,110 foreign military aircraft to overfly Ireland. Permission was granted to the following countries: Belgium, Botswana, Cameroon, Canada, Croatia, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the UK and the United States.</P>
        <P>Permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly the State is granted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. Permission is normally granted on condition that the foreign military aircraft is unarmed and not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives. The specific <Col N="210"/>arrangements that apply to the United States of America regarding overflights were agreed in an exchange of letters in January 1959 between the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, and the US Ambassador. Under this agreement, the US is granted blanket permission for overflights of unarmed military aircraft. The US Embassy provides regular <i>post hoc</i> statistics of overflights, broken down by month. It is not the practice of the Government to release details of an individual country&rsquo;s landings and overflights.</P>

	<P>Statutory responsibility for the establishment of the referendum commission lies with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Under the Referendum Act 1998, as amended in 2001, an order by him establishing the referendum commission for any given referendum can only be made following the initiation in the D&aacute;il of the Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The Government has already made clear that it is committed to ensuring that the referendum commission will have sufficient time and resources to fulfil its role in respect of the referendum on the European constitution, as indeed it had for the second referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
        <P>On that occasion, the Referendum Commission was established on 9 July 2002, more than three months before the polling day of 19 October. In its subsequent report the commission was &ldquo;glad to report that the additional time made available <Col N="211"/>to it on this occasion enabled it to carry out a much more wide-ranging and comprehensive information campaign than in the past.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The appropriate statutory fee has to be paid on each occasion when a passport is sought. The relevant fees are set out in S.I. 82 Diplomatic and Consular Fees [Amendment] Regulations 2004. There is no provision in these regulations for the issue of replacement passports free of charge.</P>
        <P>From 26 October 2004, all Irish passport holders visiting the United States require an individual machine-readable passport to avail of the US visa waiver programme. Holders of hand-written passports have the option of either replacing their existing passport with a machine-readable one (including, as indicated above, paying the appropriate fee) or obtaining a visa, in advance, from their nearest US diplomatic or consular mission. These new requirements apply to all visa waiver countries, including Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department has gone to considerable lengths to publicise these new requirements so that holders of Irish passports that are not machine-written would be able to obtain new, machine-readable passports in good time if they envisaged travelling to the US. The Passport Office advertised these new requirements in the national press of the 12 and 13 September and they have been publicised on the Department&rsquo;s website and on passport application forms for the past year. An arrangement was also put in place last year to produce machine-readable passports in Dublin for applicants abroad who requested such a passport.</P>
        <P>All Irish passports produced in Ireland and in the Irish Embassy in London are machine-readable and meet the new US requirements. Only passports issued at other missions abroad, or by the Duty Officer Service in Dublin and Cork, are hand-written. These comprise approximately 5% of all Irish passports issued world-wide each year. My Department is currently developing a new passport issuing system, which is due to commence production before the end of this year. When that system is fully implemented, Irish passports, whether issued at home or abroad, will be machine-written.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217, 218 and 220 together.</P>
        <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers died on 12 May 2002 at King&rsquo;s College Hospital, having been found hanging in his prison cell while on remand at Brixton Prison on 9 May 2002. The Irish Ambassador in London wrote to the Governor at HMP Brixton on 16 May 2002 to express the Government&rsquo;s deep concern about his death and to request that the Embassy be informed of any developments in relation to the investigation of his death.</P>
        <P>It is not the normal practice for a representative from an Irish Embassy to attend inquests into the death of Irish nationals in custody abroad. However, I am aware that, in the report of the inquest into this case on 15 October 2004, the coroner&rsquo;s Office, while concluding that he was suffering from severe depression, highlighted failures in the Prison Service that it felt could have contributed to his death.</P>
        <P>The Irish Ambassador has made strong representations to the prison authorities in London following the deaths of a number of men of Irish nationality or of Irish descent, including the person to whom the Deputy refers, between 1998 and 2002 in HMP Brixton. Subsequently, the Governor of HMP Wandsworth was asked to conduct a review of all non-natural deaths in custody in HMP Brixton from 1998 onwards. In March 2003, the review team published its findings, known as the Heavens report.</P>
        <P>The report concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that, in some of these cases, policies and procedures were not properly carried out and that, in some instances, actions were taken that were not in accordance with the prison&rsquo;s suicide prevention policy. It also noted that there was no evidence to indicate that any of these deaths was as a result of prejudice against the men because of their Irish nationality or descent.</P>
        <P>Shortly after the publication of the report, a new prison governor was appointed at Brixton drawn from the Prisons Services Inspectorate. Following the appointment, an officer from the embassy met with the Governor and the Director General of the Prison Services and was assured that both were committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Also since <Col N="213"/>then, the embassy has had regular contacts with the new governor and his staff about the report and the implementation of its recommendations as well as other prison matters.</P>
        <P>The Irish Ambassador has also met with the relatives and friends of the men involved to discuss the findings of the report.</P>
        <P>Since the report&rsquo;s publication, the embassy has not been notified of any further deaths of Irish citizens in HMP Brixton but I can assure the Deputy that my Department, through the embassy, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been providing financial assistance to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas for many years. The ICPO provide valuable support and assistance to Irish prisoners overseas and their families which complements the services provided by the consular section of my Department and our missions abroad.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, an annual grant of &euro;25,000 has been made to the ICPO here in Ireland and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I am in a position to increase the amount this year to &euro;30,000.</P>
        <P>Assistance is also provided through the D&iacute;on fund to the ICPO office in London, which deals exclusively with Irish prisoners in Britain. Earlier this year, the ICPO in London received an initial grant of &euro;110,000 from my Department. As a result of the additional funding for services to the Irish abroad this year which my predecessor announced last July, I understand that the D&iacute;on Committee, which advises me on welfare issues relating to the Irish community in Britain, has recommended that an additional grant be awarded this year.</P>
        <P>As the funding for services to the Irish community in Britain is further increased in line with the recommendations of the task force on policy regarding emigrants, I can assure the Deputy that the valuable work done by the ICPO on behalf of Irish prisoners in Britain will be duly recognised.</P>

While the specific communications mast referred to by the Deputy has not been raised at the most recent negotiations, we will continue to press on the British Government, as the security situation allows, the need to ensure continued progress toward the complete normalisation of security arrangements as set out in the Joint Declaration and Good Friday Agreement.</P>

        <P>As outlined in their strategic plan for 2003-07, HRI pointed out that there is a compelling case for the development of an all-weather facility. HRI also takes the view that commercial considerations must also be taken into account, and it will support the development of an all-weather track either at an existing track or on a green field site subject to the following conditions being met: proximity to a major urban area; ability to stage floodlit evening racing; a left-handed oval circuit of ten furlongs in circumference; constructed using the best available surface; a dual-purpose facility which can stage national hunt racing.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by HRI that it is considering three proposals for such a development and HRI expects to finalise its consideration of the various issues shortly.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority is actively working to implement the Government decision on the decentralisation of its offices to Thomastown, County Kilkenny. An implementation team has been set up which reports directly to the chief executive and progress is reported to the board of the authority on a regular basis. In addition, the interests of the authority are represented on my Department&rsquo;s main decentralisation implementation committee and senior representatives from the authority participate in a decentralisation implementation sub-group on decentralisation of agencies of the Department.</P>
        <P>A detailed implementation plan has been prepared in consultation with the key stakeholders and submitted to the Flynn working group.

In addition, discussions have commenced with the staff unions through the authority&rsquo;s industrial relations council.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P>To date, 11 of the authority&rsquo;s staff have applied to transfer to Thomastown. This figure represents 10% of the total figure of 110 staff required.

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>At the request of the T&aacute;naiste, two officials of my Department travelled to Kilkenny to meet union officials, workers&rsquo; representatives and Mr. Martin Carroll, county councillor, at the factory (details supplied) on 23 June 2003. The manager of the company attended as an observer for a short while. There have been no further meetings since that time, nor is it envisaged that there will be any such meetings.</P>
        <P>The union officials and the workers&rsquo; representatives spoke at the meeting. They made the case that the workers who had been made redundant up to January 2003, before the new enhanced rates came into force in May 2003, should be retrospectively paid these enhanced rates. However, these workers were paid about 3.2 times the then statutory rate by the company on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>The legal advice given to my Department when this type of issue was considered during the drafting stage of the Bill to give statutory effect to the new enhanced rates was that retrospective effect could not be given, as to do so would be placing a legal onus on employers retrospectively. The Oireachtas is not permitted to impose retrospection on employers in these circumstances. Unfortunately for the workers concerned, my Department is precluded from paying the enhanced rates of redundancy with retrospective effect.</P>
        <P>The case was also made on behalf of these workers that, if it was not legally possible to meet their claim for payment of the enhanced rates, the <Col N="218"/>Government should consider bringing a scheme to the Oireachtas to enable them to be paid the enhanced rates from the social insurance fund, SIF, as a special case. This proposal was also considered and deemed impractical. It would mean making a special case for the workers concerned on the basis that they had missed out by being made redundant quite some time before the new enhanced rates were passed by the Oireachtas into law. Many thousands of other workers are in a similar position and could make a case for special treatment.</P>
        <P>It was also mentioned at the meeting, which the officials attended, that during the negotiations with the employer, the workers had intimated that they were at that time prepared to accept, in final settlement of their claim for extra statutory redundancy payments from the employer, the 60% rebate the employer was entitled to receive from the SIF. I have no say in what the employer does with the 60% refund, which he was legally entitled to be paid from the SIF.</P>
        <P>It is regretted that the workers in this factory and other workers in similar circumstances have not been able to benefit from the increased redundancy payments. However, the legal position cannot be changed, nor can special legislative provisions be made for any particular group of people.</P>

	<P>I have no plans to introduce a new scheme of migration for highly skilled graduates. I am satisfied that the current administrative arrangements are sufficient to allow highly skilled individuals to reside and work in Ireland, where the required skills cannot be sourced within the European economic area, EEA. The EEA comprises the 25 member states of the European Union and Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Nationals of the EEA do not require any form of authorisation or permit.</P>
        <P>The working visas or work authorisations scheme is designed to facilitate the employment of individuals from outside the EEA who are highly skilled in particular economic sectors where labour shortages exist. Principally, these are health professionals, information computing technology professionals, and construction professionals, for example, architects, engineers and town planners. However, for international companies that are located here, an intra-company transfer facility is available, on a case-by-case basis, to enable them to transfer senior managers or exceptionally skilled staff to Ireland, for a fixed duration, without an economic needs test.</P><Col N="219"/>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for exceptional needs payments to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. In determining entitlement to an exceptional needs payment, the health board must be satisfied that an exceptional need exists which cannot be met from other sources. As a general rule, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not used to fund medical services or costs directly incurred in the delivery of medical services.</P>
        <P>The South Eastern Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the couple in question made an application for an exceptional needs payment in respect of the cost of an alternative medical treatment. In the opinion of the board, the expenses in question are not considered appropriate to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The matter is being considered as a health services issue by the board, which is now examining the possibility of providing the treatment directly or of contributing to the cost of it for the couple through that system.</P>

	<P>I have recently asked my Department to carry out a comprehensive examination of the arrangements for assessment of capital, particularly in so far as they apply to SSIAs, and I will consider what action needs to be taken on foot of it. I expect that this examination will be concluded in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to readily quantify the number of persons in receipt of social welfare payments who are holders of SSIA accounts. This is because the source of any capital held is not maintained electronically on the relevant payment systems.</P>
        <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. Capital may include stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value, savings certificates, bonds or national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value, and money invested in a bank, building society, and so on. In assessing the value of capital, however, significant disregards are applied. The first &euro;12,697.38 of capital is disregarded and the assessment is on a sliding scale for amounts above this. In the case of old age pensions, for example, a single pensioner with <Col N="221"/>capital of up to &euro;20,315.80 qualifies for a full pension while a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;68,565.84 qualifies for a minimum pension. These amounts are doubled in the case of married pensioners.</P>

	<P>Under the existing free travel scheme, pass holders who reside in the Republic of Ireland can travel free within this jurisdiction. Similarly, people who live in Northern Ireland and who hold a concessionary travel pass can travel free within the North. Under the special cross-Border arrangements, in place since 1995, both southern and northern pass holders can undertake cross-Border journeys free of charge.</P>
        <P>The introduction of free travel on an all-Ireland basis would enable southern pass holders to make free onward journeys within the North. Similarly, Northern Ireland pass holders would be able to make internal journeys within the Republic free of charge. There are a number of issues to be resolved in order to implement an enhanced all-Ireland free travel system on these lines. These issues will require co-operation between my Department and the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland as well, as the relevant northern and southern transport operator companies.</P>

	<P>The repayment of social welfare overpayments is regulated by a code of practice, Statutory Instrument No. 227 of 1996. The code requires that, in the context of overpayments, due account be taken of the interests of taxpayers and social insurance contributors who finance the various social welfare payments as well as the ability of the person concerned to repay and, in this regard, that every effort be made to recover overpayments in full.</P>
        <P>Where an overpayment has been assessed, the person concerned is afforded an opportunity to bring to the notice of the Department or health board any views he or she wishes to offer on the assessment of the overpayment and the proposed method of repayment. The person&rsquo;s views are taken into consideration before the matter is finalised. There is provision within the code for the repayment of an overpayment to be deferred, suspended, or cancelled, or for the rate of repayment to be reduced depending on the circumstances of the case. When determining the method and rate of repayment, the authorised <Col N="223"/>officer is required to give consideration to any facts or circumstances relevant to the question of the recovery, and the circumstances in which it arose.</P>
        <P>The code of practice already ensures that account is taken of a person&rsquo;s ability to repay an overpayment, whether this is attributable to misunderstanding or fraudulent intent, while at the same time ensuring that moneys incorrectly paid are recovered. In 2003, 17,000 cases of fraud, costing &euro;13.7 million, were discovered, while customer or third party error accounted for 23,000 cases, at a cost of &euro;17.6 million. Almost &euro;17 million was repaid to the Department last year for overpayments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 241 together.</P>
        <P>The back to work allowance scheme which was introduced in September 1993 is part of my Department&rsquo;s programme of initiatives designed to assist long-term unemployed people, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance for self-employment and the back to work allowance for employees.</P>
        <P>The allowance was introduced at a time when long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. In its early years, the scheme proved very effective in helping people who had been long-term unemployed to return to the labour force. However, changes in labour market conditions since the mid 1990s have reduced the need for the scheme. This is illustrated by the drop in numbers availing of it in recent years. At present, there are 12,097 participants in the scheme, compared to 39,343 in October 2000 when the scheme reached its peak.</P>
        <P>The scheme was reviewed in 2002 in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the scheme in 1993. This review also took account of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants. They recommended that the scheme should be restructured in the light of the changes in the labour market. In particular, the review recommended that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</P>
        <P>In January 2003, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit or assistance was increased to five years. Recipients of other social welfare qualifying payments were not affected by the change. The scheme is continually monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market and economic conditions. It was recognised that there was some difficulty being experienced by persons wishing to enter self-employment after five years attachment to the live register. Therefore, in the budget of 2004, the qualifying period for access to the self-employed strand of the scheme was reduced to three years for those in receipt of an unemployment payment, effective from March 2004.</P>
        <P>The numbers of recipients at the end of each of the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 are shown in the following table.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of disability benefit, entitlement to payment is not affected by the residential status of the claimant. Disability benefit is an insurance payment made to persons who are unable to work due to illness and is paid if the person satisfies the PRSI contributions for payment. Disability benefit is, therefore, paid while a person is in hospital or any long-term care institution without restriction.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, DPMA, scheme was transferred from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in October 1996. On the transfer of the scheme the existing qualifying conditions were retained and the scheme was renamed disability allowance.</P>
        <P>One of the qualifying conditions applying to the former DPMA scheme was that the payment could not be made to people who were in residential care where the cost of the person&rsquo;s maintenance was met in whole or in part by a health board.</P>
        <P>Effectively, persons who would otherwise have qualified for disability allowance would continue to have their maintenance costs and, in certain cases, an element of spending money met separately rather than through a disability allowance payment.</P>
        <P>Since the take-over of the scheme by my Department, the restrictions on payment to persons in residential care have been progressively eased. From August 1999 existing disability allowance recipients who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care.</P>
        <P>A review of illness and disability payment schemes completed by my Department in September 2003 recommended the removal of the residential care disqualification for disability allowance purposes. The working group which oversaw the review recognised that the removal would have a range of implications, and that, in the absence of reliable data on the numbers involved and the funding arrangements currently in place, it was not possible to fully assess the likely impact or cost of such a move.</P>
        <P>Budget 2003 provided for the take-over by my Department of the discretionary &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; allowances paid to people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance and for the standardisation of the level of these allowances. My Department is currently completing an information gathering process with <Col N="226"/>the health boards with a view to arranging for the transfer of responsibility for the payment of these allowances and of the funds involved. An assessment of the scale of the transfer and its implications for a more general removal of the residential care disqualification for disability allowance purposes will be made in the light of this transfer and having regard to available resources and priorities generally.</P>

The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, <Col N="229"/>to all carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance.

	<P>The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the health boards, is to make up the difference between a person&rsquo;s means and his or her basic needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining the amount of assistance payable.</P>
        <P>Asylum seekers who are catered for under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are provided with full board accommodation and other facilities such as laundry services and access to leisure areas. In recognition of the level of services provided in these cases a reduced rate of supplementary welfare allowance, that is, &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child, is payable in respect of personal requisites.</P>
        <P>In some cases asylum seekers are accommodated in step down facilities under the direct provision system. The criteria for assessment of such cases are the same as those applying to any other recipients, including people who have been supplied with hostel type accommodation. If accommodation only is supplied full rate supplementary welfare allowance less a deduction of &euro;13 in respect of the accommodation is payable. If additional services are supplied, for example, breakfast or other meals, the amount of allowance payable is reduced to take account of the level of additional service supplied in each individual case.</P><Col N="230"/>
        <P>With effect from May 2004 basic supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a habitual residence condition. Newly arrived asylum seekers are unlikely to satisfy this condition and are instead paid a direct provision allowance, equivalent to the relevant supplementary welfare allowance rate. Payment of this allowance is currently being made on an administrative basis through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, as an interim measure, pending arrangements being put in place by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who will assume responsibility for direct provision allowance and in step down facilities with an similar agreement in place with the Department of Health and Children for that Department to take over responsibility for payments to unaccompanied minors.</P>
        <P>The structure and rate of the direct provision payment is designed to give equality in the treatment of asylum seekers in direct provision compared to others in hostel type accommodation. Wherever there is a shortfall in the level of a person&rsquo;s means, assistance in the form a basic allowance may be paid to bring the person up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
        <P>Any increase in the rates of the weekly allowance paid to asylum seekers in direct provision would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

In future, non-compliance with motor tax law will not be considered to be a valid reason for refusing to take a driving test candidate out on test. Under the Road Traffic Acts, the role of a driver tester is to assess the driving competency of candidates presenting for a driving test. A driver tester has no enforcement function in relation to the validity of motor tax discs. This is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <Quest>the reason penalty points cannot be endorsed on the entry in licence records from the date of payment of charge.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the introduction and operation of the penalty points system, contains specific provisions governing application of such points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed on a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under Section 5. This date is referred to in the Act as the appropriate date.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the 2002 Act on the appropriate date recognise that as a result of the endorsement of penalty points a person may face the application of an automatic disqualification from driving. Section 3 of the Act establishes that where a person accumulates at least 12 penalty points, he or she will be disqualified for a period of six months.</P>
        <P>If penalty points were to be applied from the date of the commission of the offence in the first instance or from the date of the payment of the fixed charge, a person could be faced with the prospect that they would have already been disqualified in advance of any notification being sent to that effect. This would in turn create the situation that a person would be open to a charge of <Col N="233"/>driving when disqualified where they had driven in the period between the commission of the original offence or the payment of the charge and the date of the notice.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system has been designed and structured to ensure that any person who is accused of the commission of a penalty point offence is afforded a significant time period to chose whether or not to allow the matter to proceed to court. Save in respect of eight of the 69 offences determined to be penalty point offences in the Act, the option of the payment of a fixed charge is afforded to the accused person. A person presented with a fixed charge notice is given a period of 56 days in which to make such a payment before the certainty of a court summons is applied.</P>
        <P>There is therefore a potentially significant period made available to a person to make a decision and all of the time period relating to the system that are established in the Act are set out in the fixed charge notice issued in respect of the alleged commission of the offence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access.</P>
        <P>However, representations have been received by my Department seeking to extend access to bus lanes to a wide range of other road users, including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists. A review of the access issue was carried out in 2001. As part of that review the views of the director of traffic in Dublin City Council, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were sought. All of those bodies suggested that there should be no change to the current position. I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 to 262, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Dublin Airport Authority that preliminary co-ordinates of the western threshold of proposed runway 10/28 were provided by the former Aer Rianta to ERM at the commencement of its study and the latter&rsquo;s draft report of June 2003 depicted, for illustrative purposes, the proposed runway 10/28. A minor amendment to the co-ordinates of the western threshold of the runway, in the order of approximately 100 m, was notified by the airport authority to ERM during the consultation phase of <Col N="235"/>the draft report and this correction was incorporated in the final version of the ERM report.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Airport (Parking Fees) By-Laws, 1977, SI 92 of 1977, set the parking fees for vehicles in Dublin Airport from 1 April 1977. However, the airport by-laws of 1978, SI 225 of 1978, provided at Regulation 6(7) that parking fees at the airport may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister. The 1978 by-laws were revoked by the airport by-laws of 1994, SI 425 of 1994, which provided at Regulation 8(9) for the former Aer Rianta to set parking charges at the State airports.</P>
        <P>Planning and development issues, including the designation of areas where development is restricted, such as green belts, are a matter for the local planning authorities who take account of the views and requirements of third parties and the facilitation of sustainable economic growth and development. In the case of lands in the vicinity of Dublin Airport, Fingal County Council and its predecessors are responsible for land use planning and the Deputy might consult the local authority on the status of its designations around Dublin Airport in the 1940s.</P>
        <P>With regard to the documents of March 1968 referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the Dublin Airport Authority that they indicated two parallel east-west runways of potentially 11,500 ft in length.</P>

	<P>Changes in Bus &Eacute;ireann services are an operational matter for the company.

The sole pur<Col N="236"/>pose of this notification procedure is to ensure a level playing field between public and private operators from a market regulatory perspective. In considering there notifications my Department makes no judgment on the operational merits of the proposed service changes.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in correspondence with my Department about a number of proposed changes to their services between Letterkenny and Dublin among others. A number of the changes sought were noted by my Department on 16 June and 30 July. Bus &Eacute;ireann recently notified my Department of a number of additional proposed changes to services and these are currently being processed by my Department.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to a similar question put to me on Tuesday, 2 November 2004, by Deputy Durkan. The situation in relation to the Maynooth to Dublin railway line has not altered since then.</P>
        <P>Irish Rail has significantly increased the capacity of services along the Maynooth rail line over the past five years and is committed to further increases in line with growth in commuter demands. In particular a step change increase in the order of 35% was implemented during peak periods from December 2003 onwards. This was achieved through the introduction of 80 diesel railcars for use on commuter services. Plans are currently in place to further increase capacity along the line with the deployment of new units of rolling stock to be introduced during 2005. I understand further service enhancements for commuters along this line are currently being planned by Irish Rail.</P>

The person named was written to on 21 September 2004 advising that the animals in question would accordingly be rejected from the application and was informed of the right of appeal.

	<P>The milk quota regulations allow a number of options to a lessor when a lease expires. The lessor may resume production, renew the lease with the same lessee, establish a lease with a close family member, and in certain very limited circumstances where the lessor is in the early retirement scheme he or she may establish a new lease with a non-family member. The <Col N="242"/>lessor may also sell the quota without the land to the departing lessee, sell the quota into the restructuring scheme, or sell the land with the quota attached on the open market.</P>
        <P>Under the single payment scheme, the dairy premium is payable in respect of eligible quota available on a producer&rsquo;s holding on 31 March 2005. Where a person has leased out his or her quota to a producer for the period of 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2005, the dairy premium in respect of that quota is payable to the lessee.</P>

	<P>Sheep farmers from Northern Ireland are not precluded from buying breeding sheep here but the following rules apply to the export of such sheep. Intra-Community trade in sheep is governed by the provisions of Council Directive 2003/50/EC, which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards reinforcement of controls on movements of sheep and goats and which came into force on the 1 July 2004. These controls apply to breeding sheep whether they are imported or exported.</P>
        <P>Under these rules, breeding sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export including a standstill period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding. A derogation applies where sheep or goats introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding. Breeding rams must also come from a holding on which no case of contagious epididymitis, brucella ovis, has been recorded in the previous 12 months and they must have been kept permanently on the holding for 60 days prior to export. Breeding rams must also be tested for contagious epididymitis, brucella ovis, with a negative result, within 30 days prior to export. The rules on scrapie are that all breeding sheep must either be of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype, or have been kept in a scrapie monitored flock for at least <Col N="244"/>three years with no cases of scrapie being confirmed during this period.</P>
        <P>In the case of exports from breeding shows, it is a fundamental requirement that breeding sheep being exported would not come into contact with animals of a lesser health status, that is, production or slaughter sheep. In this respect, prior arrangements between show organisers and the appropriate district veterinary office would be needed. Breeding sheep being exported must be inspected by an official veterinarian during the 24 hours preceding the loading of the animals and issued with an intra-Community health certificate signed by the official veterinarian.</P>

	<P>As announced by my colleague the former Minister for Finance on 3 December 2003, the Irish Prison Service headquarters will be decentralised to Longford. It is anticipated that up to 178 jobs currently assigned to various Dublin locations, including 130 staff of the Prison Service employed at its current Clondalkin headquarters, together with other elements of prison management including the buildings services, purchasing services and a number of contract IT support staff will decentralise. The legal formalities relating to the acquisition from Longford County Council of the site selected for the new headquarters building are nearing completion.</P>
        <P>Based on the decentralisation central applications facility, CAF, data of 7 September 2004 some 37 employees of the Prison Service together with 108 other civil servants and five public servants have nominated Longford as their first preference for relocation. As the Deputy is aware, the CAF continues to be open for the receipt of applications until such time as the decentralisation programme has been implemented in full.</P>

        <P>Generally, students are not able to change their status while in the State. If they wish to enter employment following completion of their studies they will require a work permit to do so. In general, visa required nationals are required to return home while the work permit is processed and apply for a visa in order to return to the <Col N="247"/>State. However, where the prospective employment is directly related to the course of studies the person has recently completed then it is possible to change one&rsquo;s status from student to worker without having to leave the State. The working visa or work authorisation schemes may also be open to certain graduates depending on the field of their qualifications.</P>
        <P>Being the parents of an Irish-born child does not of itself grant any special immigration status to non-nationals. Such persons must ensure they are legally resident in the State.</P>

	<P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately &euro;12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;449.3 million. This now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which &euro;157 million has been set aside.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, my Department, with the technical assistance of ADM Limited, has processed and I have approved 1,253 applications for capital grant assistance of more than &euro;120 million and 997 applications for staffing grant assistance totalling &euro;103 million. Almost &euro;45 million has been allocated for quality projects. A list of outstanding capital applications is now being finalised and my Department will write to the applicants in the near future.</P>

	<P>The refugees in question made an application for ten family members to join them in the State. The application fell to be dealt with under the provisions of section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 which provides a statutory mechanism for the evaluation of applications for family re-unification with family members by refugees who are resident in this jurisdiction. Under section 18(3) such permission will be granted to immediate family members, that is, spouses, minor children and parents of minor children, upon verification of the authenticity of the relationship. Visas have now been approved in respect of three children of the applicants who came within the ambit of section 18(3).</P>
        <P>Applications for other dependent family members may also be made under section 18(4). Dependent members of the family mean any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on the refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully. If such dependency is proved these applications may be granted at my discretion.</P>
        <P>As six of the family members who are the subject of the current application do not come within the ambit of either of these provisions I am not in a position to grant family re-unification in respect of them under the provisions of the Act. In processing the application for the tenth person inconsistencies were noted which require further investigation before this application can be finalised.

	<P>The Garda authorities maintain an up-to-date assessment of the threat of attacks against this country from international terrorist groupings through analysis of intelligence gathered from domestic and international sources.</P>
        <P>The Garda involvement over an extended number of years in fora within the European Union and further afield has ensured that excellent lines of communication and co-operation have been developed and fostered with police and security services worldwide. This facilitates ongoing sharing of intelligence concerning terrorist groupings and enables a rapid operational response to be put in place where circumstances dictate.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002, which concluded Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4 November last, will further enable this State to fully play its part in the fight against international terrorism. In particular, it will give effect to a number of international instruments directed to terrorism and will enable the State to meet commitments undertaken as part of the European Union and the broader international community.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the Bill will give effect to the European Union Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism by making provision for the first time for terrorist offences as a separate and distinct category of offence in our law and by making provision for the application of the relevant provisions of our existing anti-terrorist legislation to terrorist groups who commit terrorist offences whether based in or outside the State. It will also give effect to four United Nations conventions directed to specific manifestations of terrorism and its support structure.</P>
        <P>Security threat assessments on the risk level to Ireland of terrorist attack are furnished by the Garda authorities at regular intervals to the Government and myself. While it is not the practice, and it would be contrary to the public interest, to reveal the content of these threat assessments, the Deputy will appreciate that it is vital that the resources of the State are used fully to combat the real, ongoing threat posed by international terrorism.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that there are no plans to expand the Garda mounted unit.</P>
        <P>The unit was established in March 1998 with one sergeant, six garda&iacute; and a complement of six horses. As part of the approval to establish the unit, a review of the unit was conducted after the initial two years. The unit is a national resource in support of regional policing requirements. The current strength stands at 14, all ranks, and 13 horses.</P>
        <P>A new competition will commence in the near future to return the strength of the unit to its authorised strength of 18 members, all ranks. In this regard, I am informed that one sergeant is currently serving on a UN mission overseas and is due to return in May 2005.</P>

        <QRef>[27923/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to allow asylum applicants to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications. There is a number of key reasons that <Col N="253"/>the present policy in regard to access to work by asylum seekers should not be changed.</P>
        <P>Section 9 (4)(<i>b</i>) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, provides,<i> inter alia</i>, that an applicant for asylum shall not seek or enter employment. It must also be borne in mind that under the 1996 Act asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. However, we must face the fact that, despite its humanitarian purpose, people seek protection under the 1996 Act, which gives effect to the State&rsquo;s obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, for the purpose of avoiding legitimate immigration controls in order to gain a foothold in the State for economic reasons. Other EU states have experienced similar trends.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that any extension of the right to work arrangement would greatly undermine the considerable progress which has been made in relation to asylum processing arising from the Government&rsquo;s asylum strategy which has resulted in more speedy decisions in regard to applications for refugee status. The continued momentum in processing timescales for asylum applications has resulted, for example, in a situation where prioritised applications receive an interview and decision at first instance within six weeks of application and timescales for considering appeals have also been reduced considerably. The number of applications over six months in the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the refugee appeals tribunal at the end of September 2004 stood at 1,536 as compared to some 6,500 at the end of September 2001.</P>
        <P>Extending the right to work would have a very negative impact on asylum numbers as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so. The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December 1999 compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999.</P>
        <P>Any significant increase in applications would also have a negative impact on our capacity to accommodate asylum applicants while they are awaiting a determination of their claims. As things stand, the ongoing provision of services to meet the reception, health, welfare and accommodation needs of asylum seekers is an enormous challenge for all the State agencies who work in this area. The total cost to the Exchequer of the provision of services to asylum seekers was approximately &euro;353 million in 2003.</P>
        <P>Any proposal to grant asylum seekers access to the labour market would also undermine the current and effective work permit system which provides a comprehensive channel for legal migration to the State. It would further widen the gap in a negative manner in terms of reward between those who access the labour market legally through the work permit and visa channels <Col N="254"/>and those who simply abuse the asylum process to gain entry.</P>
        <P>It is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination. It is clear from the profile of applicants, and the results of the determination process, that a significant number of people have sought asylum in Ireland with a view to seeking work. Many people are already working illegally. It is my very strong belief that any extension of the right to work to all applicants would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a cast iron guarantee of a right to work.</P>
        <P>The greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. The structures in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and fulfils our international obligations under the Geneva Convention to those seeking asylum. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants who come here under the misguided expectation that they will be able to work would be totally contrary to these obligations and could completely negate the major investment in effort, time and resources which has gone into bringing our overall strategy to its current status.</P>

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 29 March 2004 and was accompanied by a passport for the eight year old in question. The immigration authorities were not satisfied as to <Col N="255"/>the authenticity of this passport and the visa was refused on 11 October 2004.</P>
        <P>It may be of benefit to the Deputy if I outline some background to this case. The eight year old in question arrived in the State in the company of his mother in January 2000 whereupon his mother made an application for asylum. She gave birth in July 2000. The husband arrived in the State in November 2000 and made an application for asylum. Both parents subsequently withdrew their asylum applications and applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child. This permission was granted to both parents in March 2001. The mother of the person in question has since come to the adverse attention of the Garda authorities.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was granted a C visit visa to enter the State to spend her school holidays with her mother for a period of three months. It now appears that she is seeking an extension of her permission to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>An examination of the papers in relation to the case indicates that the father of the person concerned gave his permission for her to travel to Ireland for three months, to visit her mother, in the company of named persons who guaranteed they would return his minor daughter to her country of origin.</P>
        <P>A wrap around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to involve themselves in any activity or to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted. Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.</P>
        <P>A C visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence, it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. The person concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State should she wish to return. She should include in her new visa application the purpose and duration of her intended stay.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including person<Col N="257"/>nel, that Garda statistics regarding the personnel level in every Garda station within each Garda division refer back to 31 January 1997.

The personnel strength of Clonmel Garda station as at 1 January 2004 was 40, all ranks.</P>
        <P>In regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased to say that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. However, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing and they will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the garda authorities that a thorough investigation was carried out by the Garda into allegations that were made and a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed there should be no prosecution. As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. This is a long standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the Garda is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted, and for what criminal offence, is the responsibility of the DPP. The DPP, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy 2004-06, which forms the framework within which road safety policy will be developed over the next few years, sets out a number of ambitious targets and strategies. The Garda Commissioner is fully committed to the enforcement strategies laid out in the strategy. Many of the targets and actions recommended are already at various stages of implementation or planning, including the private operation of speed cameras and the outsourcing of the collection of fixed charges.</P>
        <P>I recently announced the Government approval for an extra 2,000 garda&iacute;. Additional resources provided to the Commissioner will be used to optimum effect and in a focused way. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the question of resource allocation. Among the areas being examined is the number of garda&iacute; deployed in traffic units. The increase in the number of garda&iacute; will enable extra manpower to be allocated to the traffic units which enforce road traffic legislation and contribute to reducing road fatalities and casualties throughout the State. In particular, it will make possible an increase in targeting enforcement on high risk locations and times and days of the week, in line with Garda operational policy.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Commissioner is considering structural changes in this area of Garda activity with the aim of increasing the effective use of personnel and equipment resources available. I will announce changes in this area in the near future.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that collision-prone locations are being identified on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of the National Roads Authority and local authorities. These data serve as input into the enforcement activities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have carried out Operation Lifesaver since 1998, focusing on three main collision causation factors, excessive speeding, non-compliance with seat belts and driving while intoxicated. The annual Christmas campaign focusing on drink driving will commence at the end of this month.</P>

        <P>As regards resources in the Dublin metropolitan area, I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the number of personnel, all ranks, assigned to each Garda station as at the 31 December each year from 1997 to 2003 is as set out in the table following.</P>
        <P>In this regard I should like to mention that the personnel resources in the Dublin metropolitan area as of 8 November 2004 is approximately 230 greater than the comparable number in 1997. Furthermore, there has also been a considerable increase since 1997 in the number of garda&iacute; serving in national units which are available to all the stations in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P><Col N="261"/>

	<P>The building referred to was acquired by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the probation and welfare service on 15 April 2002. The total cost of the purchase was &euro;1.5 million, including VAT. Additional costs to date amount to &euro; 240,000, including VAT. If further <Col N="265"/>envisaged refurbishment were to proceed, the future costs associated with that work have been estimated to be in the region of &euro; 2.4 million, including VAT.</P>
        <P>On purchasing the building, the intention was to renovate and extend the premises, using one portion as a local office and the other as a probation centre. However, before proceeding with the refurbishment project, due to concerns which emerged in the matter, the Department decided to review the suitability of the location in question and examine alternative location options in the Blanchardstown area. If an alternative location ultimately emerges for this centre appropriate steps will be taken to avoid loss to the Exchequer arising from the acquisition of the original premises in Blanchardstown.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants scheme, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>When assessing students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the schemes are of general application and it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases. It is not proposed. in the foreseeable future, to change the current position in relation to the assessment of students under 23 years of age.</P>

	<P>My Department is not aware of the number of primary teachers who qualified in 2004 who have failed to obtain employment. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. I am committed to reducing class sizes still further. However, this can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

On conclusion of the current Estimates and budgetary process, I intend to publish the 2005 building programme which will operate in a multi-annual framework.</P><Col N="271"/>
        <P>The national education centre is proposed to support teaching of and through Irish, be a national centre of excellence working closely in collaboration with other bodies across all levels of education, and provide in-career development for teachers. Key functions planned for the centre are the provision of training, resources and research and sharing of best practice for teaching of and through Irish in first and second level schools. The centre will work closely with colleges of education on the pre-service training of teachers to ensure a high quality supply of teachers of Irish and support, where relevant to its remit, the work of other agencies which promote the Irish language. The centre will provide training to teachers, advisers and policy makers.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, established in March 2001 under section 31 of the Education Act, will manage the centre when it becomes operational.

	<P>The report of the capital review and prioritisation working group established under the Higher Education Authority was published recently. It sets out a strategy to meet the future capital needs of the third level sector. Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute included the proposal to develop a permanent campus in the planned Clonmel technology park at the Ballingarrane estate in its submission to the review group. The group&rsquo;s report stated that the institute&rsquo;s proposal for the disposal of an existing property in Clonmel and acquisition of an alternative one had merit on the basis that no Exchequer funding was required. The submission by the institute to the review group also included several capital proposals on other campus developments in both Clonmel and Thurles. However, the review group recommended that the policy framework for the institute should be re-examined before the other proposed investment proposals could be considered. My Department understands the institute is considering its capital development proposals in this context.</P>

	<P>The post leaving certificate programme is a labour market programme aimed at providing vocational education and training for school leavers and re-entrants to the labour market. The programme also offers alternative pathways to higher education. The allocation of places on post leaving certificate courses has always been subject to an approval process. Vocational education committees and individual schools and colleges outside the VEC system have been given an allocation of post leaving certificate places for 2004-05 equivalent to their 2003-04 allocation except where the application by an individual school or college was for a lesser number. Nationally, a total of 28,588 places have been approved for post leaving certificate courses for 2004-05.</P>

A letter to this effect issued to the school on 21 October 2004. My officials have also spoken with the school principal about the matter.</P>
        <P>To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that there are now more than 5,000 special needs assistants in the primary school system, up from a figure of 300 in 1998.</P>
        <P>I accept, however, that there are individual cases where schools are awaiting decisions on applications for additional resources and I am taking measures to ensure the process is speeded up. This whole process will shortly undergo major transformation as the National Council for Special Education commences operation on the ground throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has established a team to review the level of special needs assistant support in mainstream schools generally. The team has commenced its task and is assessing the levels and deployment of such support to ensure the needs of children are being met in the context of new applications for resources for the school.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme.

A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s interest in participating in the Government&rsquo;s pilot programme arose pri<Col N="277"/>marily for four reasons: to take schools-colleges principals and managers away from running buildings and thereby allow them concentrate on their core educational-management functions; to test value for money of school-college provision over a longer period than construction; to get new ideas on school and college design through an output-based approach; and to see better usage of school-college buildings outside of school hours. These objectives are now being analysed in the operation phase of the project and it is the intention to carry out a full evaluation of all aspects of the process following a suitable timeframe. In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General recognised in his recent report on the project that &ldquo;ultimately, the full value for money represented by the grouped school project will be determined over the 25-year life cycle of the project&rdquo;.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>Difficulties arose regarding the supply of some equipment to the schools. However, these have been dealt with by my Department in consultation with the operator. Other smaller issues arose with individual schools regarding, for example, the installation of IT software or the interpretation of some terms in the contract and these were also resolved. My Department receives a monthly report of any issues raised in each of the schools that allows us to monitor the operation phase carefully.</P>
        <P>The first pilot programme has highlighted two issues, first, the speed of delivery and, second, the quality of the school buildings. In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the fact that the schools were constructed far more quickly than under traditional procurement. The entire process, from seeking expressions of interest to hand over of the schools, took a total of two and a half years.</P>
        <P>As the PPP contract is for 25 years the operator, Jarvis, takes a stake in the whole-life cycle of the building by aligning responsibility for operation and maintenance with responsibility for design and construction. Therefore, the operator adopted a &ldquo;spend to save&rdquo; policy. In essence this means that the quality of materials and construction are high to militate against future depreciation and to minimise maintenance and operational costs. The principle of everything works applies under the PPP process. Classrooms, laboratories, heating and lighting all have to be available every day during the lifetime of the project to avoid deductions to the operator&rsquo;s unitary payment. Given the experience and knowledge gained by my Department on the pilot projects, it is my intention to procure further school building projects using the PPP process.</P>

	<P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise regarding the proposed model for allocating resource teachers to primary schools, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as proposed. Accordingly, I will be reviewing the proposed model to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities without the need for cumbersome individual applications while at the same time ensuring that pupils in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year. It is important to emphasise that applications may be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</P>

	<P>Applications for the higher diploma in education are made through the Higher Diploma in Education (National University of Ireland) Applications Centre, known as HDEAC, which was established in 1998. HDEAC centrally accepts and processes applications to the four constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland for the higher diploma in education, namely, National University of Ireland, Cork; the National University of Ireland, Dublin; National University of Ireland, Galway; and National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Previously, graduates interested in studying for the higher diploma in education applied directly to the university of their choice.</P>
        <P>Applications are made to HDEAC through one common application form. In the case of Trinity College, applicants continue to apply directly to the university and I understand that places on the higher diploma in education course are awarded on the basis of academic qualifications and the results of a competitive interview process. My Department is responsible for approving the annual number of places on the higher diploma in education course. The numbers of applicants to HDEAC and approved places in the years referred to by the Deputy are set out in the following table:</P>

	<P>Development contributions have been levied on developments since 1964 to ensure some recoupment to local authorities of the cost of servicing lands for development. Planning authorities have been drawing up development contribution schemes in accordance with the revised framework established by section 48 of the Planning and Develop<Col N="284"/>ment Act 2000. These schemes are intended to ensure that the long-standing practice of levying development contributions to help fund local authority infrastructure is implemented in a more transparent and consistent way across the country than has been the case in the past. This process has led to a reduction in the level of development contributions in a number of local authority areas.</P>
        <P>Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, it is the responsibility of planning authorities to determine the level of contributions for their functional areas, the classes of development to which the contributions will apply and any waivers which should apply in their areas. By way of departmental circular letter, planning authorities were advised that a scheme can allow for a reduced contribution or no contribution in certain circumstances, for example, for particular types of community infrastructure, shops, etc., in areas in need of regeneration, in brownfield areas or for charitable developments. All planning authorities have provided for waivers or reduced contributions in their development contribution schemes. These were adopted by the statutory deadline of 10 March 2004 and are now in force.</P>
        <P>Development contributions are now being levied to help pay for recreational and community facilities, among other amenities. These recreational and community amenities will help to ensure the national spatial strategy objective of achieving better quality of life for everyone, both in urban and rural areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 392 together.</P>
        <P>No application has been received in my Department for grant assistance for the building referred to in the question under the scheme of EU co-financed grants for the conservation of the architectural heritage provided for under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department has also established that no application for funding has been made to Kildare County Council under the grants scheme for the conservation of listed buildings, which is administered by local authorities, although the council is aware of the project. If the project promoters wish to proceed with an application for grant assistance under either of these schemes, they are <Col N="285"/>advised to do so as early as possible as the deadline for receipt of applications is imminent.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 to 373 inclusive together.</P>
        <P>The number of dogs humanely destroyed in 2003 is set out by local authority area in the fol<Col N="286"/>lowing table. Under the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1982, county councils and city councils are responsible for operating dog control and licensing services. The legislation requires local authorities to appoint dog wardens and to arrange for the provision of shelters for stray and unwanted dogs. The proceeds from the sale of licences, less the commission charged by an Post, are available to local authorities to fund, or to assist in funding, their dog control services. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of additional resources, if any, to be applied to these services.</P>
        <P>Section 11 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 provides that if a seized dog has not been returned to its owner after five days, it may be disposed of or destroyed in a humane manner. There is no information available to my Department regarding the costs of destroying dogs or the cost of keeping the dogs prior to their disposal or destruction. My Department has no funding line for the provision of shelters for stray dogs and, therefore, no grants were allocated or paid in 2003. However, I understand that the Department of Agriculture and Food provided funding in 2003 to voluntary organisations dealing with animal welfare.</P>
        <P>Certain provisions of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 may be extended, by regulations, to other species of domesticated animals, including cats. In the absence of reliable data regarding the number of feral cats, and of appropriate solutions, it is not proposed to place an additional responsibility on local authorities that might dilute their control efforts in relation to dangerous and stray dogs which are generally viewed as presenting greater problems than feral cats. There are no EU regulations governing the provision of dog shelters.</P>

        <P>I am advised that the Office of Public Works has appointed consultants to carry out a feasibility study to assess the future visitor requirements, access routes, visitor management and visitor numbers at the Rock of Cashel. It is expected that the final draft of the study will be completed by the end of the year. On foot of this study, the Office of Public Works, in consultation with my Department will consider what changes, if any, are necessary for the efficient management of visitors at the site.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is also currently engaged in a programme of conservation/<?oasys _jy?>stabilisation works at this site under the National Development Plan 2000-2006; but there are no plans for restoration works beyond these. I am advised that the Office of Public Works has commissioned a conservation plan for Athassel Abbey. It is hoped to have this plan completed by the end of the year. In light of this plan, the Office of Public Works in consultation with my Department, will consider whether conservation or consolidation works are required at this site.</P>

	<P>European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, incorporates measures aimed at ensuring that ELVs can be deposited free of charge by their final owners at authorised treatment facilities and then dismantled, treated and recovered in an environmentally sound manner, and meeting new recovery and recycling targets, by average weight per vehicle, of 85% reuse-recovery by 2006, to include 80% materials recycling, and 95% reuse-recovery by 2015, to include 85% materials recycling. Article 6.3(c) of the directive specifically requires that the ELV stripping operations undertaken at authorised treatment facilities shall be carried out in such a way as to ensure the suitability of vehicle components for reuse and recovery, and in particular for recycling.</P>
        <P>Enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the directive were incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. It is intended to make regulations as soon as possible fully transposing the directive provisions and facilitating its full implementation in 2005.</P>

	<P>The prioritisation of non-national road improvements in their area is a matter for consideration by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the basis of funding from their own resources supplemented by State grants.</P>
        <P>In August this year, my Department sought applications from local authorities for funding under the 2005 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme. The application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did not include improvement of the Rathsallagh access road. Local authorities may also use their <Col N="291"/>discretionary improvement grant allocations from my Department to fund eligible road improvement schemes. In 2004, the total discretionary improvement grant allocation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is &euro;322,000. The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is a matter for the council.</P>

        <P>Information on the number of planning decisions of Fingal County Council, which were overturned on appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is contained in the annual reports of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. However, these reports do not distinguish whether the overturn was of a grant or a refusal of planning permission by the local authority.

	<P>Under section 34 (10) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the board is required to indicate the main reasons and considerations on which its decisions are based. Where a decision by the board to grant or refuse permission is different from the recommendations in the report of the inspector in any particular case, the board must indicate the main reasons for not accepting the recommendations.</P>
        <P>As part of the response to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the operation of the planning appeals system, an Bord Plean&aacute;la has put in place a mechanism in relation to complaints against its decisions. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the file relating to the decision will be reviewed and, although the decision itself will stand, where necessary, the board may issue a clarification.</P>

	<P>Section 146 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables An Bord Plean&aacute;la to authorise a person to prepare a report on any matter on behalf of the board. Any person so authorised must make a written report to the board, which must include recommendations, and the board must consider the report and recommendations before determining the matter. An Bord Plean&aacute;la has issued guidance notes to its inspectors on the main issues to be reported on in making a report to the board. Section 150 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 Act provides for the adoption by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of a code of conduct for dealing with conflicts of interest and promoting public confidence in the conduct of its business.</P>
        <P>The code further requires that persons employed by the board are to carry out its work in an independent manner that embodies the public service ethos of integrity, impartiality and a desire to serve the public interest while giving due consideration to all legitimate viewpoints and interests.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1998, the Heritage Council developed a pilot scheme for the placement of heritage officers, dedicated to the conservation and promotion of heritage, within local authorities. This pilot scheme involved a partnership agreement with local auth<Col N="293"/>orities for the appointment of heritage officers. The council co-funds the appointments with local authorities, on a declining scale, over a five-year period. The pilot scheme has since been mainstreamed in many local authorities and to date, 24 heritage officers have been employed.</P>
        <P>The heritage officer scheme has operated well and has been very successful in raising heritage awareness at a local level, consistently with my Department&rsquo;s overall heritage objectives. I would expect that local authorities would favourably consider the continuation of heritage officer appointments in the context of allocating resources and within the overall framework of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>The latest finalised data on packaging waste materials and recovery are contained in the national waste database interim report for 2002 published by the EPA in June 2004. The EPA estimates that 296,389 tonnes of packaging waste was recovered for recycling in that year, representing an overall recovery rate of 33%.</P>
        <P>Indications are that packaging waste recovery has increased further since 2002 arising from the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans, assisted by my Department from the environment fund, and new packaging regulations introduced last year requiring the segregation and recycling of specified back-door packaging waste by producers.</P>
        <P>Column one of the following table gives a breakdown of the overall tonnage of packaging waste recycled by packaging material in 2002, as outlined in the EPA interim report. Based on data supplied by Repak &mdash; the voluntary compliance scheme established by Irish industry to meet Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery targets &mdash; column two of the table indicates the estimated tonnage by packaging material which was recycled in Ireland in that year. </P><Col N="293"/>

        <P FLI="0">On the basis of the Repak data indicated in column two of the table, an estimated 34.2% of packaging waste recovered was recycled in Ireland. In addition, most of the materials exported for recycling are subject to initial partial processing in Ireland. For example, glass is processed into cullet before being transported for recycling, primarily to a facility in Northern Ireland, ferrous metals are often sorted according to various grades and shredded, plastic is crushed and baled, paper is shredded and cardboard baled.</P>
        <P>The packaging waste materials recovered are principally recycled into intermediate raw materials which are ultimately used in the manufacture of new packaging materials and other products.</P>

	<P>A proposal for a wastewater scheme to serve Piltown, at an estimated cost of &euro;300,000, was ranked ninth in the list of waste water schemes submitted by Kilkenny County Council in November 2003 in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>
        <P>The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004-06, published in May 2004. Given the ranking afforded to the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>
