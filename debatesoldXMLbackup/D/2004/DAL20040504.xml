      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I understand Mr. Justice Barron will report next, at the beginning of June, on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, together with the Clones, Belturbet and Pettigo bombings of 28 December 1972 and four other bombing incidents that took place before May 1974, as well as the murder of Brid Carr in November 1971 and the murders of Oliver Boyce and Brid Porter.</P>
        <P>Following that report, he will report on the case of Seamus Ludlow. He will then report on other cases including the Dundalk bombing of 1975 and in the context of that report, he will report on a number of other bombings that took place after May 1974 including the Castleblaney bombing. I also understand Mr. Justice Barron has concluded his work on substantial portions of these reports but some contacts are still outstanding.</P>
        <P>It would be the intention that the report, would be considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and they would be published. I would like to thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for its report and its comprehensive consideration of the Barron report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974. The sub-committee dealing with the report had a very difficult task and the members of the sub-committee carried out their work diligently and with great sensitivity. This was very important work dealing with the events that caused the highest number of fatalities on a single day during the conflict in Northern Ireland and left so many people suffering and traumatised.</P>
        <P>The committee presented its report to the Oireachtas and before coming to any decision on the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report, the Government would wish to consider the views of the Oireachtas on the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In an earlier reply the Taoiseach indicated the second Barron report would be available early in 2004. As I am competing with some noise here, I did not quite hear if the Taoiseach gave a date for this. How does the Taoiseach propose handling the second Barron report? Does he intend it to be addressed in the <Col N="1143"/>same fashion as the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reply states that work is well advanced on the second report and some contacts remain to be made. While I do not have a date, I assume it is not too far in the future. I understand he has most of the drafting done and he just has some outstanding contacts to make. That will cover a number of the cases. It will cover the two bombings in Dublin 1972 and 1973. It will also cover the Clones, Belturbet and Pettigo bombings in 1972. It will also cover the other bombing incidents that took place before May 1974, the murder of Brid Carr in November 1971 as well as the murders of Oliver Boyce and Br&iacute;d Porter. That is the report which is nearly ready.</P>
        <P>He has a separate report on the Seamus Ludlow case. The Deputy will recall that the House later asked that this case be investigated. There has been a considerable delay about that matter because the family was not satisfied initially. That report will be prepared. In the context of that report, he will also cover the post-May 1974 issues, which would include the Dundalk bombing of 1975 and a number of other bombings that took place after the 1974 bombings, including the Castleblaney bombing. That is some considerable time away. I presume we are talking about later in the year if not the end of the year before we get that report.</P>
        <P>We will deal with them in the same way. We will give them to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the first Barron report? I ask in particular about the recommendation that a figure like Judge Cory would carry out an initial inquiry. Has the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British authorities? Did he raise it with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, over the past weekend? If he did, how does he assess the response of the British authorities given the pivotal role they would have to play in implementing the recommendations of the sub-committee on the Barron report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first instance, the Government has not considered the report formally. We have stated we will await the Oireachtas debate on this issue. It must be debated in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad. In the report of the sub-committee, the work of which I commended, it is stated that once the committees of investigation legislation is passed through the Houses, the sub-committee will be in a position to consider the aspects of the matter covered within our jurisdiction. Those are the issues involving the Garda and the so-called missing <Col N="1144"/>files. I have no difficulty with that. Equally, the sub-committee stated that as part of the investigation process, if the House so decides, a judge could examine these aspects again. That is a matter which the Government will discuss.</P>
        <P>It will be necessary to have further discussions about those aspects of the matter which involve Northern Ireland and an inquiry and investigation there. The merits of that will be considered. While the idea is that an examination like that carried out by Mr. Justice Cory should take place, its feasibility will have to be considered. I raised the matter initially with the Northern Ireland authorities through Secretary of State, Paul Murphy. He has already written to say the authorities have no further files, reports or data and cannot bring anything more to the table on this issue. We have a formal letter stating that is the position.</P>
        <P>I raised this with Prime Minister Blair on Sunday in the context that after the debate in the House and the Government&rsquo;s consideration, we will return to the matter. I informed the Prime Minister of the recommendation of the committee that these matters should be investigated in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland or, presumably, both. I have not been informed of an official British Government position, but I have made it clear to the Prime Minister that we will come back to the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the publication of the last report, Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s attendance at the sub-committee appears to have been helpful in the search for the truth behind the atrocities. Can the Taoiseach confirm or does he have any information to the effect that Mr. Justice Barron will make himself available to the sub-committee in respect of any forthcoming report on these matters? It transpired that a number of key personnel were not contacted or interviewed by the commission in the context of the preparation of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Can we assume that will not happen again in respect of any future report by Mr. Justice Barron?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether Mr. Justice Barron will make himself available is a matter for his consideration. As Deputy Kenny said, he has been quite helpful in coming forward to the sub-committee, answering questions and elaborating as much as he possibly can. I am sure he will do that again. Everyone who looks at these issues will say there are other matters which should be examined. If this moves to another stage, that point can be made again. Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s view was that he covered all the people who were brought to his attention and the issues he thought were relevant. If a report like Mr. Justice Cory&rsquo;s is to be produced, those will merit further examination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred earlier to the issue of missing files from the Department of <Col N="1145"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Is he aware of the concerns of the Justice for the Forgotten group which has questioned the efficacy of multiple inquiries on selected aspects of the bombings? There has been talk of holding what appear to be compartmentalised inquiries. Is the Taoiseach of the view that there must be a single effective, efficient inquiry in which all matters can be brought together and dealt with as they interact?</P>
        <P>In February this year, which is some time back, I put a question to the Taoiseach about the remembrance fund established in February 2003. At that time the Taoiseach mentioned there was &euro;9 million available and it appeared there would be early disbursement of that money. Given that at that time the Taoiseach stated work was almost finished and it was expected the commission would shortly be in a position to invite applications, can he indicate what progress has been made since February?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have an up-to-date position on that matter but I can get one for the Deputy. As I understand from replies to cases I referred to the commission, work is ongoing. I will obtain a note for the Deputy in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the other issue raised by the Deputy, it will be a matter for the House following debate and the Government&rsquo;s consideration in terms of the way forward. It is the sub-committee which divides the issues and it compartmentalised them into internal issues and stated the committee of investigation should examine the Garda investigation and the issue of missing documentation. The sub-committee feels such matters come within our jurisdiction and should be handled by us. That appears a sensible suggestion if, ultimately, it is agreed. The sub-committee also stated it considers a public inquiry in Northern Ireland and/or Great Britain is required and represents the best opportunity of success. It then states as reasons for that recommendation, that any information, witnesses or issues would have arisen in Northern Ireland or Great Britain. I am merely stating the distinction drawn by the sub-committee. Obviously if a Cory-type investigation picks up on such matters, it will use Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report as its basis. I believe the difficulties will arise in a Northern Ireland context but the best way to handle it will be a matter for future consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I may not have picked up clearly on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s first response to the questions tabled. Will he confirm in terms of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s ongoing investigations, that the matters relating to the 1972-1973 Dublin bombings in which George Bradshaw, Thomas Duffy and Thomas Douglas were killed; the Belturbet bombing in 1972 which killed two teenagers, Geraldine O&rsquo;Reilly and Patrick Stanley; the bombing at Dublin Airport in 1975 in which John Hayes died; the Dundalk bombing <Col N="1146"/>in 1975 in which Hugh Watters and Jack Rooney died and the Castleblayney bombing of 1976 which took the life of Patrick Mone and the murder of Seamus Ludlow are being addressed? Did the Taoiseach indicate that some would be investigated later? Will we again see a staggered return from Mr. Justice Barron?</P>
        <P>Recalling that Mr. Justice Barron included in an attachment to his first report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings a report on the murder of John Francis Green, is further action being considered on that report? We have received and have proceeded to address Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings but what of the report on John Francis Green? What, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view, is the current position of that report? Will further attention be drawn to it? What of Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report on each of the other cases instanced? Where, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view, will all that lead?</P>
        <P>The sub-committee on the Barron inquiry called upon the Government to establish an investigation into the key missing departmental and Garda documents regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Has that investigation been established? If not, when will it be established and what form will it take? Will its establishment require legislation or a motion before this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised three issues. I outlined, in reply to Deputy Rabbitte, the position regarding the first report. It must first be debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and then by the Government in terms of recommendations and processes for moving on. That includes the full substance of the first report.</P>
        <P>His second report deals with events which occurred before 17 May 1974. It covers the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Clones, Belturbet and Pettigo bombings of 28 December 1972, four other bombing incidents which took place before May 1974 and the murders of Br&iacute;d Carr in November 1971 and of Oliver Boyce and Br&iacute;d Porter. They are all dealt with in one report. The drafting of that report is well advanced. Some contacts are continuing in which Mr. Justice Barron is involved and to which I am not privy. He will report on that.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron will then report on the case of S&eacute;amus Ludlow. He will report on the Dundalk bombings of 1975 and will look at a number of other bombings which took place after May 1974, including the Castleblayney bombing. Mr. Justice Barron was asked to do these reports at a much later date. I do not know when this third report will be made but I presume it will be a considerable time from now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the investigation into the missing file?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That recommendation was made after the debate in this House and it goes back to Government. If that recommendation is adopted, the report recommends that the matter <Col N="1147"/>be taken up by a committee of investigation. We must await the examination of the report in the House and by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will happen shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach had contact with the Justice for the Forgotten group, representing the relatives, since the publication of the majority report of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? I am sure the Taoiseach has studied the sub-committee&rsquo;s report. Is he committed to holding a further inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Did the Taoiseach receive a response from the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, when he mentioned the issue to him last weekend?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the statement issued by the Justice for the Forgotten group following the publication of the sub-committee report, that the next inquiry &mdash; and the group is convinced that their must be a further inquiry &mdash; must be effectively constituted to bring finality to this issue? Does he agree with the Justice for the Forgotten group that a firm timetable for action is required and that the Government should immediately engage with the families in agreeing the structure and elements of a properly constituted international human rights inquiry to bring finality to this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, is the answer to Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s first question. I keep in regular touch with individuals from the Justice for the Forgotten group. I also have formal meetings with the group.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Gregory and all Members of the House, I would like to see a full and complete end of this matter. We have agreed a process for that. The report must be debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and then considered by the Government. We must then decide how to move forward, based on the recommendations of the report. I do not have difficulty with any of the recommendations but we must go through the formal process.</P>
        <P>We have received a conclusive reply from the Secretary of State that the British Government has no further information or data. I raised the matter again with the Prime Minister on Sunday last. We must await the ultimate response of the British Government to the recommendations of the report. The members of the British Government are aware of the report and I have highlighted it to them.</P>
        <P>In the future we will face the difficulty of how best to reach finality in this matter. We must go through the process outlined in the report and see <Col N="1148"/>how best to do that. I am committed to doing that in so far as I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the stated commitment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to fight against terrorism in Madrid and elsewhere, did he not jump at the opportunity to assure the Taoiseach that he would co-operate fully with an inquiry into terrorism on his doorstep?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated, the response from the Secretary of State, Mr. Paul Murphy, is that Mr. Justice Barron has been given all the information the British Government has. I do not think the British Government has considered yet the recommendation in the report by Mr. Justice Barron. A good reason for that is that the Government has not yet done that. However, the British Government is aware of it and knows the contents of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now within a fortnight of the 30th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974. While the focus on Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s inquiry is correct, I want to revisit my earlier question on a further report presented by Mr. Justice Barron on the murder of Mr. John Francis Green and the expected reports on the pre-1974 incidents which the Taoiseach outlined and the later attention to all those from the Dublin Airport bombing of 1975 up to the murder of Mr. S&eacute;amus Ludlow in 1976. What will be done in regard to each of these incidents? Let us hope that the report on the murder of Mr. John Francis Green has not been parked. What does the Taoiseach envisage will be done on each of the reports that Mr. Justice Barron is addressing and will address in the future? Will specific steps be taken arising from these reports as they all reflect an important aspect of the story of collusion in the events of this jurisdiction during the 30 year period we have lived through?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered that question when I stated the report will be debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it goes to Government. That process is set out in the findings of the committee. The other reports should be processed in the same way. Ultimately, we will have to consider how best to bring the matter to finality, as Deputy Gregory stated. In my view this is as good as any other way, because no alternative is laid down. That covers the issues in our jurisdiction, however, I do not know at this stage if there will be a public tribunal of inquiry in Northern Ireland or Great Britain. That will have to be processed with the authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mr. John Francis Green case was not referred to the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that issue dealt with in a separate part of the report?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will bring attention to that, if it is not part of the process. My understanding is that the full report will be debated in this House and in the Seanad and will then be considered by Government. I assume all of it, including that part, will be discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _ic20-?><Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated that the holding of an inquiry either in Northern Ireland or Britain would not be without problems. Does he agree there is a need to press further for the holding of a full public inquiry in this jurisdiction? Does he not accept the view of the relatives that it would be extremely onerous on them to have an inquiry held across the water and to expect people to go back and forward? Will he use the provisions of strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure it is held in this jurisdiction and that it is fully open to both Governments to have an input into it? Will he use his persuasive powers to ensure the British co-operate with a full public inquiry in this jurisdiction?</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Taoiseach replies, I will take a final supplementary question from Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach comment specifically on the recommendation in respect of the possible reference of a case to the European Court of Human Rights? Has the Government given separate consideration to the initiation of such a case? How does he propose to proceed in the House in respect of the sub-committee&rsquo;s report? Does he intend to proceed by way of resolution from Government to set out the parameters of the debate on the report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the debate in the House, it is a matter on which we must agree. There needs to be a debate which presumably will be based on the committee&rsquo;s report either to support or amend its recommendations. There was an agreement that the matter would be debated prior to bringing it to Government for final consideration and action on it. This should take place as early as possible. We will try to finalise in the House the committees of investigation legislation. It is recommended that the report should be put before that committee.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question, the sub-committee drew the distinction in this regard. I am not drawing a distinction. The sub-committee&rsquo;s view is that because the likely witnesses who might be able to assist in respect of any evidence that might or might not exist are based in Northern Ireland and the UK, the <Col N="1150"/>inquiry will not get anywhere if it is held in this jurisdiction. It has no problem dealing with Garda matters and so on in this jurisdiction. Based on legal advice, the committee believes that if the inquiry is held down here, co-operation will not be forthcoming in so far as these people are still alive and known. The committee spelt this out clearly. This is the point we must pursue with the British Government.</P>
        <P>The other reports must be dealt with in the same way, particularly in regard to 17 May. On reading Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report, it is obvious that all the involvement and activities relate to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
        <P>There were 11 freedom of information requests received in my Department for the first three months of this year as compared with 80 requests received for the same period last year. All requests for the first three months of this year have been acceded to. Eight freedom of information requests were received during February 2004 compared with 29 for the same period last year.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;435 in application fees has been paid to my Department since the introduction of the fee charge in July 2003. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with both the 1997 Act and the 2003 Act, and their implementation is kept under constant review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past five months of 2003, there were 21 freedom of information requests received in the Department of the Taoiseach. That compared with 61 requests received from August to December 2002, which represents a net reduction of approximately 66%. The Information Commissioner stated that she has concerns about the decrease in the number of requests and, if the decline continues, it will have serious implications for the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
        <P>Given that there was a 66% reduction in requests to his Department, does the Taoiseach feel the expression of concern by the Information Commissioner impacts on his Department? Does <Col N="1151"/>he feel the regulations and conditions of change introduced by the Government have strangled the Freedom of Information Act? Does he propose to ease the regulations or restore the flexibility which existed heretofore?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is more appropriate to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt idown="4" down="5">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, the numbers were in decline. The areas of the Act with which we thought there might be difficulties, namely, sections 19 and 20, have not presented any. As can be seen from the total figure of &euro;435 which I gave, it cannot have had much effect on the personal applications. As the Deputy knows, there is no cost for cases or appeals in which people seek personal information. Therefore, there is no change. Furthermore, no certificates have been issued under section 19, which we debated in the House, in respect of exempt records of Government meetings. No certificates have been issued under section 20 by my Department and I do not think any have been issued by other Departments. However, that is a matter for the Department of Finance. It is apparent from the figures that the main change is that the Act is being used less as a scoping method.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Information Commissioner has been highly critical of the 2003 changes. Has the Taoiseach met Ms O&rsquo;Reilly on this issue and when does he expect her report? I understand she has promised a review of the amended Act in June. Is it now time to re-examine the charges which have been made? One individual spent more than &euro;3,000 trying to extract information which was not for personal gain. Does the Taoiseach not agree that a refund might be in order if &mdash; as is the case in this instance &mdash; the person in question is found to be operating in the public interest without any agenda, either from a journalistic or any other point of view? It is too much to ask a person to pay &euro;3,000 to get a right to information. Is this not more like a pay-per-view service rather than a right to information service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This question relates specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Act itself is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point. Any meetings will be between the Information Commissioner and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>We based the Act on the experience in other countries and when one compares the charges in those other countries against those here, they are still very low. Admittedly, it is a great deal if someone spends &euro;3,000. I do not know the circumstances of that case but even though there is an enormous burden of information, the entire <Col N="1152"/>figure in my Department is &euro;400 for almost a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government made any assessment of the impact of the legislative amendments made to the original Act? What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s impression of commercial enterprises or professionals who were said to be using the Act to assimilate and accumulate information which was commercially advantageous to them in the cheapest possible way? Is that practice continuing or has it fallen off?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can answer for my own Department because it is easy to do so. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Companies have stopped using the Act even though the costs are low. Due to the practice being highlighted so much in the debate and in various discussions, it is not being used by commercial interests. Some companies were using it as a service to gather the information but that practice has ceased.</P>

        <P>The constitutional amendment concerning the entitlements to Irish citizenship of children of non-national parents will be held on 11 June 2004. The Government has no further proposals at present to hold any other referenda in 2004. <Col N="1153"/>The position will continue to be held under review in the light of developments including the outcome of the examination by the Government of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution&rsquo;s ninth progress report on private property, which was published on 7 April, the outcome of the examination of the report published on 28 April 2004 by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges sub-committee on reform of the Seanad, and the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference on the draft constitutional treaty which commenced in Rome on 4 October 2003.</P>

	<P>If the House is agreeable I will take two questions from Deputies Sargent and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, a reply from the Taoiseach and then two questions from Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte with a final reply from the Taoiseach. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach looked again at the ill-judged decision to have the citizenship referendum on the same day as the local and European elections in light of the amount of advice that has been given on this? Does he now accept that there is not going to be a need for a referendum on the price of property, as he said before, given the all-party committee&rsquo;s report? What legislative response will the Taoiseach give in the light of that decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On 17 February I asked the Taoiseach in the House if it was intended to hold a referendum or referenda during 2004. In his reply he said the Government &ldquo;has no proposals at present to hold a referendum to change the Constitution&rdquo;. On 14 January, more than a month before that, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government notified the Department of Finance that there were strong indications that a further ballot paper would be required for polling on 11 June and that additional e-voting machines had been procured.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach explain why that information would have been in the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance more than a month before he replied to my question of 17 February? He made no reference to this information nor admission or indication of such consideration, let alone of a decision. Was it not disingenuous at best of the Taoiseach not to have referred to that information which must have been available to him?</P>
        <?oasys _ah?><P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that, in light of the continual requests of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution for comprehensive consultation and legislative scrutiny of all constitutional referenda proposals, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill should have been referred to that committee in the first instance as a matter of best practice? Does he agree that it is unacceptable that this matter has <Col N="1154"/>bypassed an Oireachtas committee and moved ahead to a referendum without consultation?</P><?oasys _xh?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of legislation on the property issue is being discussed by a number of Departments. I note what the report states, although I have not read all the documents on the property issue. The National Economic and Social Council report on housing is also due out shortly. That will be important and should be read along with the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I also note that the committee&rsquo;s report states several times that the issue is not the price of land but the price of housing. To be frank, I do not believe that, although it is a finding from our constitutional committee. It is extraordinary. I have read the case study the committee offers to support that statement, but that does not match with what I live with and see every day. Maybe the committee members know much more than me. As I said to Deputy Rabbitte when we discussed this previously, if this problem can be dealt with through legislation, then we should examine that option closely and move on legislation.</P>
        <P>I remember the arguments, the cases and the briefs I read extensively about Part 5<b>. </b>These matters are being discussed in a number of Departments. In recent years I have read a considerable amount on these issues. The report states that, perhaps, the Kenny report was over-conservative. Many examinations of the Kenny report have been carried out during the past 30 years, all of which state that the report is far too radical. It is a totally different interpretation of it. I make those points because I have read this subject over many years.</P>

	<P>I am not sure if that will solve the problem, but perhaps legislation is the way to proceed and then we will see what happens.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, many of these issues are subject to discussion before a decision is finally taken. The rule is that one cannot prejudice Government decisions and one has to avoid making public statements or commenting on policy proposals that are not brought to Government or are under consideration by the Government. That is the rule of the Cabinet handbook.</P>

	<P>On the second issue, in so far as this matter was covered in Oireachtas report, there was a clear view of what should happen in the 1996 Oireachtas review report. It thought we should legislate to amend the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in would not want to deny his fellow Irishmen, Deputy Rabbitte and me the right to express an opinion here. It appears as if we are now in uncharted waters in respect of Judge Curtin. Today the Government decided to give him extra time.</P>
        <P>If legislation has to be introduced for judicial regulation, I assume that would require an amendment to Article 35 of the Constitution. If that is the case, obviously it is uncharted waters and will require great sensitivity and thorough discussion and investigation, as would any amendment of the Constitution. It is good governance to bring the people with Government in dealing with problems. It appears from soundings that the Government will require the full co-operation of the House if these waters are to be entered. In that case, would it be good governance, from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s perspective, to withdraw the citizenship referendum, which is being rushed on the people without thorough investigation and analysis? There would then be the possibility of two serious referendums, on a date to be appointed later in the year, following full and thorough discussion at an all-party committee or whatever forum may be appropriate.</P>
        <P>Following the debacle of the rushed judgment on electronic voting, serious consideration of an amendment to the Constitution should be fundamental to how the Government deals with its business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying to the House that no heed should be paid to any answer he gives on this kind of generic question in the future because the Cabinet has not formally endorsed a referendum? Why did he tell the House on 17 February that there would not be a referendum when manifestly it was decided between himself and his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there would be?</P>
        <P>If the Government is as determined this week as it was last week to impeach Judge Curtin and to impeach him without compensation, is that still&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it does, Sir. Like Deputy Kenny I believe we will be forced down the road of a constitutional amendment. The question was put down not just to highlight the fact that the Taoiseach told the House one thing on 17 February and a different thing today. The question was tabled because we want to know whether the Government is contemplating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it does not. I am positing a specific one. For as long as I have been a Member of this House, it has been possible to put in such a generic question and to tease it out by way of reference to a particular case. I ask the Taoiseach if his Government is as resolved this week as it was last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise out of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to impeach Judge Curtin and whether he thinks it will be necessary for us to have a constitutional amendment to do precisely that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue raised by Deputy Kenny, I do not agree with any of the points he made about the citizenship referendum. This issue was highlighted eight years ago. We tried to operate a particular system but abuses of the law in some respects were being practised more frequently. This will be a minor change. It will not have that great an effect on most people. It will have the effect of closing off an area. I do not see the necessity for further debate.</P>
        <P>Regarding the other matter, the Government considered it today. As stated this day last week, it could be that the House may require changes in Standing Orders and it might require legislation. It is being examined by the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>My advice at this stage is that it does not cause a constitutional difficulty because the problem is how to make the mechanism work. This was tried in 2001 and some of those areas have to be revisited. The constitutional right of this House to deal with a member of the Judiciary by impeachment is already in place. Judge Curtin today asked for additional time and he will be given that.</P>
        <P>The Government has also received the reports from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Until a reply is received from Judge Curtin, there will be no decision made on the action to be taken on those reports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I plan to enact legislation during 2004 which will repeal the Road Transport Act 1932 and put in place reformed arrangements for the procurement and market regulation of public transport services.</P>
        <P>I set out my policy proposals for public transport reform in statements to the public transport partnership forum in November 2002 and the Joint Committee on Transport in June 2003. As I have stated previously it is now my intention to establish an independent procurement and regulatory body for public transport which will operate on a national basis. While recent public discussion on public transport reform has focused almost exclusively on organisational issues and provider concerns, I remain convinced of the need for significant reform in the interests of the public transport user and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>With regard to a new regulatory regime for bus services in the Dublin area, I remain firmly of the view, supported by a number of professional studies and experience in other countries, that franchising is the most effective means of achieving genuine market opening to new entrants. I also remain open to additional suggestions provided they are directed at achieving the objective of genuine market opening to new entrants. Likewise, I am open to reasonable proposals relating to the pace of the introduction of competition so long as this objective is achieved in an acceptable time frame. I am currently finalising my proposals with regard to bus services outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>Talks between officials from my Department and the CIE trade unions on public transport reform are to recommence on 12 May. An intensive schedule of meetings over five full days has been arranged by the independent Chair appointed by the Labour Relations Commission. It remains my intention to proceed with legislation on public transport reform in 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Minister two separate specific questions. The first question is about the timetable for the legislation. This time two years ago in An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government promised reform <Col N="1158"/>of this legislation. The Minister has made numerous announcements to this effect since he came to office. The House is now being informed that it will happen during 2004. I ask the Minister to be more specific about the timetable.</P>
        <P>In light of the ongoing delay, is the Minister concerned, as are his officials, regarding the issuing of grandfather rights to private operators under the current legislation? More than 130 licences were issued in 2003. These people could have grandfather rights which would give them an additional financial asset over and above licences issued under a new regulatory regime. There is no mechanism either to charge the commercial value or even the cost of those licences. Will the Minister agree that legislation is urgently required?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the legislation is urgently required but it will not be taken in this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I figured that out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot see that the legislation can be brought before the House within the next couple of weeks that remain to the end of June. I am determined that it will be put through in the course of 2004.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have been very consistent in the policy on grandfather rights. There have been a number of national stoppages. I have been asked by the Deputies opposite to engage in discussions. I have engaged in those discussions and another round is taking place. We have had seven meetings since January with the trade unions on this subject. Another five days of intensive talks are now about to commence. It was my response to the request to engage in these discussions which added the extra time but I believe it will be worth it in the end.</P>
        <P>I take the point being made by the Deputy on grandfather rights. I will endeavour in the legislation to ensure that no rights are established before the legislation which would give people automatic rights after the legislation is enacted. When the regulator is conducting contests for routes or packages of routes, he can conduct an open contest irrespective of who has the route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that if he had commenced the discussions when he came into office, we would not now be in this situation? My understanding and that of the Minister&rsquo;s Department as a result of legal advice is that there will be grandfather rights involved. What impact will this have on the franchising of routes? Has the Department any estimate of the financial loss to the State? The licences granted to Aircoach were worth &euro;15 million. This is already a significant loss to the State and there could be more significant losses in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the one hand the Deputy regrets that legislation is not in place in order to <Col N="1159"/>open up the market and that is my wish also. On the other hand he is worrying about the loss of financial income to the State by virtue of the fact that it has not happened yet. I am not sure where the Deputy is coming from on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody knows where the Minister is coming from.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been very clear in what I want to do. I am seeking to have the legislation completed and put before the House.</P>

	<P>Question No. 44 in the name of Deputy Eamon Ryan should have been taken with Question No. 41. However, that question falls because the Deputy is not present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a metro with a link to Dublin Airport. I have received the revised outline business case for line 1 of a metro from the Railway Procurement Agency, which involves a line from Dublin Airport to the city centre. I am finalising my proposals on a metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area and I expect to bring these proposals to the Government shortly.</P>
        <P>Metro systems are designed to cater for the needs of areas with substantial passenger flows. Among the important considerations in selecting a route will be the level of expected patronage and the potential for raising development levies as a contribution towards the cost of the project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Estimates of the cost of providing a metro from Dublin Airport or Swords to the city centre range from &euro;2 billion to &euro;5 billion. Even the lower figure is a considerable amount of money which would be a massive investment, but the cost to the taxpayer of the public private partnership route proposed by the Minister could be much greater than the estimates I have cited.</P>
        <P>There is a case for developing a route from Swords via the airport to the city centre as it would allow stops on a number of sites which have the potential for high-density development. Questions have already been raised as to whether Dublin has sufficient population density to support a metro. The proposed Swords route would provide a critical mass and, more important, a source of income to fund a metro project. Funding could be generated by imposing levies on developers who own land along the <Col N="1160"/>route and stand to benefit substantially from such major transport infrastructure development. Would it not be proper that such people should make a contribution towards the cost of this important infrastructure? The case for doing so has been made and tried elsewhere, notably in Washington DC.</P>
        <P>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has already agreed to fund an extension to Luas by way of development levies. Such is the level of interest in an extension of a proposed metro from the airport to Swords that Fingal County Council has offered to pay the cost by means of development levies. Does it not make sense that the property owners, the value of whose property stands to be enhanced considerably by a metro, should make a significant contribution to its cost? Is that not the fairest and most logical approach to funding a metro project?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy and want levies to be used to help fund a metro. I intend to ask the Railway Procurement Agency to engage with Dublin City Council and the county councils to use levies to the full in the development of a metro. The Deputy will be aware that a levy has been proposed to raise funds with regard to the development of Luas at Cherryfield. In addition, Cork County Council has commenced procedures to raise levies to help fund the reopening of the railway line to Midleton. Levies have been used before and I intend that they will be used in the context of a metro.</P>
        <P>I also agree that an extension to Swords, if it is possible, would give a metro greater critical mass. Taking a metro through high-density areas also makes sense given that it would have to break even operationally, as is the case with the Luas. The contract for the Luas requires Connex, a private French company operating the system, to break even over the next five years. While the State pays the capital cost and interest, the company must cover operating costs on a day-to-day basis through fares. A similar structure is envisaged for the development of a metro and the Planning and Development Act 2000 would be used to raise capital through levies from property owners along the route. The operator of the system would also have to break even.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, there is increasing scope for the private sector to fund stations when railway lines are being developed. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has received proposals from the private sector indicating it is willing to develop and pay for railway stations at no cost to the taxpayer as the company opens up new areas for development. Any such proposals will have to fully comply with planning provisions.</P>
        <P>As regards cost, advisers engaged by the Railway Procurement Agency have estimated the cost of the various options for phase 1 of a metro project. The current figure envisaged is &euro;1.2 billion in total direct capital costs at 2002 prices. This figure increases substantially when one <Col N="1161"/>estimates a final cost which takes account of expected inflation between now and when the service commences, VAT fees, interest charges, the cost of risk transfer and provision for risk contingency. According to the RPA, an accurate cost for the metro cannot be ascertained until the final structure of the project has been decided and competitive bids received from international consortia. This will still be before a contract is signed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Standing Orders, Deputy Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s question falls because he was not present when it was called. I will, however, allow the Deputy to ask a supplementary question and I will extend the time available for the question to 12 minutes. I do not want my decision to be taken as a precedent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his courtesy and I will not seek to have his decision taken as a precedent. The Minister appears to have indicated recently that in addition to the metro option, he is considering an alternative option by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that it would use existing railway lines to develop a link to Dublin Airport from the DART line probably somewhere north of Maynooth. Does he agree that the real potential benefit from the metro proposal is in planning as it would concentrate development along new lines and service institutions and areas such as DCU, the Mater Hospital, Ballymun and Swords? Would it not be preferable to concentrate planning along a new line, rather than developing the existing DART railway line? Will he indicate whether his Department favours the metro proposal or the alternative Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposal? The latter would be a third rate solution that would not stand the test of time, which is test the Minister indicated would be used to decide which option we should take.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate the reason neither private nor public funding for a metro has not been included in his Department&rsquo;s five-year capital programme? The small amount of private funding included in the programme could not possibly fund the construction of a metro over a five-year period and nor would the small capital programme allocated for public transport cover its costs? Why does the capital programme not include funding for a metro?</P>
        <P>In the past year and a half, the Minister has stated on a number of occasions that proposals on a metro would be brought to Cabinet for decision within weeks. I believe I have received about ten replies in which the Minister has made such a promise. Does he still believe that to be the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of these days I will be right. As regards the question on the choice between a metro and Irish Rail&rsquo;s proposal, having examined both options I fully support the metro option. That is the Department&rsquo;s position. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has made some interesting proposals, <Col N="1162"/>some of which we have acted on, including upgrading the DART, developing double and quadruple tracking and resignalling parts of the railway network. Much of the work the company has done in developing its proposals is valuable and I thank it for them.</P>
        <P>A metro offers the best long-term solution. The first line alone would cater for 24 million passengers per annum. This is equivalent to what the DART and the suburban rail combined are currently carrying. I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s suggested route from DCU to Tara Street via the Mater hospital and O&rsquo;Connell Street. The Government has yet to finalise that route but it seems to be the right one.</P>
        <P>The Deputy posed a very astute question to the PPP. It is not involved because of the structure proposed to finance the metro. This structure involves the State paying nothing until the train runs for the first time. There would be an 18 month process for tendering and a construction period of up to four years. There would therefore be no money for a five year period. A fixed availability payment of &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million per annum, according to the RPA, would be made once the metro was up and running. It is like a fixed mortgage as it is less painful over a period of time. That is the present suggested structure of the PPP; the State would not put up capital money, the international consortia would design, build, finance and arguably operate it. An external firm will operate the Luas so it is likely the same will occur with the metro.</P>
        <P>I confess that I have sent the proposal back to the RPA more than once for additional information. I was not satisfied with some suggestions but I hope to have a decision soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bit disingenuous to sell it on the basis that we will not have to pay a cent until the trains are running but will pay through the nose for it after that. Future generations will be in hock if we go about it the way the Minister proposes.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to clarify his position on the development levies. He said he was exploring the possibility of development levies. I referred to development levies to raise funding towards the cost of construction, not the operating costs. If he is serious about that and there is much sense in taking that approach, surely it is impossible to combine it with the standard PPP. He should construct a mechanism for financing the metro at an early stage based on raising considerable funds from development levies. However, the Minister seemed to imply from his answer that he will supplement running costs from development levies. If development levies are to be included, the work needs to be done before the model for funding the project is decided. What work has been done thus far?</P>
        <P>If the Minister is proposing to examine the possibility of using development levies, the route selection is absolutely critical. He will be attempting to serve those sites where there is <Col N="1163"/>potential for development. The proposed route outlined by the RPA, which goes through my constituency, serves low density housing which will not support a metro. There needs to be some variation on that route if sites that have potential for development are to be served. The Minister needs to start looking at that now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying levies will be used for current purposes as they have to be used for capital purposes. I take the point the Deputy made. If the capital cost is to be met initially by the private sector, then where does that levy go? The RPA claimed that it would acquire much of the land by using these levies initially before it signs off on the PPP.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are very few sites on the route that are densely populated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy obviously knows the site very well. The nearer part of the route from DCU to the Mater hospital to Tara Street to O&rsquo;Connell Street to Stephen&rsquo;s Green is heavily populated. I am not sure if there is much open space between the Mater hospital and O&rsquo;Connell Street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not select a route?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the last election the Government said the metro would be up and running in 2007. Can the Minister predict in what year the metro will run to the airport? The motorway to Waterford would entail a similar cost. How does the Minister quantify the benefits of one against the other as an investment decision? Why does the road building programme get such large public funding, yet public transport projects like this metro do not get such easy access to immediate cash?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>if he will address concerns that the penalty points <Col N="1164"/>system is not being implemented in an effective manner.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12557/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The penalty points system currently applies in respect of the offences of breaching a speed limit, motor insurance and the failure of a driver to wear a seat belt or to ensure that a passenger under 17 years of age is appropriately restrained in a mechanically propelled vehicle. The system was first introduced in October 2002 in respect of speed limit offences. In the intervening period some 144,000 drivers have had penalty points endorsed in their licence records. I intend to extend the system to cover the offence of careless driving with effect from 1 June next. The effectiveness of the penalty points system can be judged primarily on the basis of the contribution it has made to road safety since its introduction. In the seventeen months since October 2002 the number of deaths as a result of road collisions has fallen by 100 by comparison to the previous seventeen month period.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the IT systems needed to support the full roll out of penalty points to the range of offences listed in the Road Traffic Act 2002 are not yet in place. I am assured by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the systems in question will be operational by the end of this year. While the national driver file, in which all penalty point endorsements are recorded is fully operational, in the absence of the other IT systems, the process of submitting data relating to the payment of fixed charges or convictions due to penalty point offences is being pursued on a manual basis by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service. As soon as my Department is notified that a fixed charge has been paid or that a court conviction has been secured in respect of a penalty point offence this information is processed and the notice is issued to the person concerned on behalf of my Department by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which administers the national driver file. Penalty points only apply 28 days after the date of that notice. This process is normally carried out in about two weeks, following the receipt of notification by the Garda authorities or the Courts Services.</P>
        <P>In overall terms the introduction of penalty points has had a very positive effect on road safety and I am confident the full roll out of the system will further enhance that effect. That the system was launched in advance of the availability of the full IT backup services has contributed directly to saving lives. However, I understand there have been administrative difficulties associated with the periods between the payment to the garda&iacute; of fixed charges and the subsequent notifications to my Department for the purpose of recording penalty points. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has addressed that matter in previous replies to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1165"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that there have been 100 fewer deaths on the roads. Many people are concerned that the points system is not effective. More and more people are getting points, but many Garda checkpoints are in areas where there is no danger. These checkpoints are on long stretches of roads, on motorways and so on. Has the Minister spoken to the Commissioner on the proportion of these checkpoints on these roads?</P>
        <P>We all know of areas &mdash; the Minister has some in his constituency, as I do in mine &mdash; where Garda patrols hide behind bus shelters, such as at the Spawell, to catch motorists coming off the motorway, which is subject to a higher speed limit. It is madness and a waste of resources when one considers the speeding cars in housing estates, etc. It seems that the system is not being implemented at accident blackspots on dangerous bends and at other dangerous places and this is why the penalty points system is losing credibility.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister call on the Garda Commissioner to review his deployment of Garda staff to make the system more effective? The system is concerned with road safety, as the Minister said. Should the penalty points system run in tandem with a broad strategy for road safety, such as good education and training programmes? Many believe the penalty points system is geared more towards generating revenue because of the manner in which points are being allocated for speeding cars. What discussions has the Minister had with the Garda Commissioner on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has discussed the strategy of tackling speeding with the Garda Commissioner on many occasions. The question of when and where the Garda does its speed checks is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner but he knows my views, which are not too dissimilar to those of the Deputy. To be truly effective, the Garda must start targeting the places where accidents are likely to happen. Increasingly, one will see that the force will do this, especially as we roll out the speed cameras. This will help substantially.</P>
        <P>The speed limits are being reviewed and it is intended that they will be delineated in metric units towards the end of the year. The Deputy will be aware that the working group has recommended and the Government has agreed with its proposal that the 60 mph speed limit be reduced to 50 mph on what are normally called country roads or back roads. Most accidents seem to take place on such roads. This reduction in the speed limit, combined with the assurance from the Garda that it will increasingly target these roads, will help considerably.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system was introduced at the end of 2002 and we had the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years in 2003. This year&rsquo;s figure is being judged against this remarkable performance, which was quite different to that <Col N="1166"/>which obtained previously. The number of deaths is still below those for 1999, 2001 and 2002. If the penalty points system prevents only one death, it is worth it. However, it is not just a question of measurement in that narrow sense but also about changing driver behaviour. The penalty points system will increasingly change driver behaviour, particularly when the computer system is fully introduced because, if one is put off the road and attempts to drive within those six months, one could receive a prison sentence. This will be a really strong incentive not to receive penalty points.</P>

With the co-operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I expect the Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 May 2003, to be enacted before the summer recess.

	<P>I thank the Minister for his response. However, it is now 12 months since we dealt with Committee Stage of this legislation and we still do not now when it will be progressed further. The Minister has established an interim commission. Will he outline the legal authority this commission possesses? I understand it has none. If this is the case, does it not make a farce of rail safety? The report produced this morning highlights that the incident in Cahir was not due to driver error or a maintenance error, thus raising serious questions about the safety assessments of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. Does the Minister believe it acceptable that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to investigate itself regarding rail incidents?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister believe it acceptable that an interim commission with no legal standing is now supervising the investigation by the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, into itself regarding the Luas tram on 7 April? Does he not believe we need to have an independent statutory commission that could investigate incidents such as this and the death of two people on the Luas rail line in Deputy Gay Mitchell&rsquo;s constituency some months ago? Given that people have lost confidence in the RPA, does he not believe it unsatisfactory that an independent investigative mechanism is not in place?</P>

I agree with the Deputy that CIE should not investigate itself, nor should the RPA. The Railway Safety Bill, of which Second and Committee Stages have been taken in the House, as the Deputy knows, will give the new authority strong powers to conduct investigations.</P>
        <P>I have asked the RPA to ensure it promotes the safety aspects of the Luas. People must be and will be informed that there are associated dangers. The Luas is a train and runs on the street as well as on its dedicated off-street tracks. It is quite silent and is operated by electricity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What about motorcyclists and cyclists who touch their brakes on the tracks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Deputy make that point also. All those dangers exist and everybody should be aware that there can be dangers attached to any public transport system. I have asked the RPA to promote safety regarding the Luas. People must exercise caution and be aware of the safety regulations that apply to any new public transport system. I encourage them to do so in the case of the Luas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not unacceptable that the RPA is investigating itself? The former Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, was very critical of CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann investigating themselves some years ago. That is why the legislation was brought forward. One cannot have an organisation taking <Col N="1168"/>an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to what issues it will investigate. For example, the RPA has decided not to investigate the tragedy Deputy Gay Mitchell has outlined. There should be a statutory independent commission to carry out thorough investigations and it should be seen to be independent and transparent. The investigation cannot take place in independent circumstances rather than under the RPA because the Minister has dragged his feet regarding the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 214 together.</P>
	<P>My Department is engaging in an ongoing process in Aer Rianta in connection with the Government&rsquo;s decision of last July to restructure the company. I will expand on this process in my replies to more specific questions tabled today. With regard to Aer Lingus, my Department is in regular contact with the company about a range of matters, including its performance in the future.</P>
        <P>With regard to the future options for Aer Lingus, I have previously advised the House that in light of the continuing turnaround in the company&rsquo;s finances and the continually changing environment, last July I asked the chairman of Aer Lingus to examine and report back to me on the future options for the company. At a meeting on 16 September 2003, the chairman furnished his report to me in which it was indicated that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. I also commissioned an independent corporate finance consultant to examine the sale options for Aer Lingus, taking account of the Aer Lingus report. In summary, he has supported the mechanisms proposed in the chairman&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>I recently advised my Cabinet colleagues of the current state of my deliberations concerning the future of Aer Lingus. I also advised that I will be reverting to Government on specific options for the company in the near future. My deliberations involve detailed consideration of the reports from Aer Lingus and the independent corporate finance consultant as well as a thorough examination of all options for the future of the company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate what discussions he has undertaken with the various parties involved? The unfortunate history in this area shows that discussions appear to take place after the event rather than before it and the Minister will be aware, as an experienced Member of the House, that it is better to have discussions before the event rather than after it. Could he also indicate the extent of the discussions with management and the workforce in both Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, if they have taken place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been considerable discussion between myself, my officials and the chairmen of both organisations. Discussions with management have occurred on a regular basis and almost weekly in recent weeks in the case of Aer Rianta. There are ongoing discussions. It is usually better to have discussions before making a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is usually the approach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose it is important for the Minister to make the decision when a microphone is shoved in front of him. It is important to make a comment on it, at least.</P>

	<P>What discussions have taken place on the privatisation of Aer Lingus and when does the Minister hope to make a decision on it? Has he discussed the timetable with Aer Lingus? Has the Minister raised with the company the downgrading of the level of service being provided by Aer Lingus at Shannon Airport? Has the Minister discussed the scandal of pilots being paid to stay at home rather than come to work? Does the Minister not consider that a serious misuse of State moneys?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Shannon, that is a matter for the board and management of the company in the context of how to run the company commercially.</P>

	<P>Deputy McDaid would like a more specific comment, particularly in the next few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read a reported statement from the chief executive in the newspapers that he was working to resolve the issue regarding the pilots. He said it was not sustainable and I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone would agree with that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to discussions on Aer Lingus, the chairman, the chief executive, my Department&rsquo;s officials and I have had a number of discussions over the past year on the future of the airline. There have also been some discussions at departmental level with trade union interests but I have not yet put any proposal to Cabinet. I will certainly have discussions with all concerned in the event that I decide to do that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of Aer Rianta, on 18 March we were within hours of having all the airports closed as a result of industrial action. That action was threatened because of a breach of faith by the Minister, according to workers&rsquo; interests in the airports. The industrial action was only called off following the intervention of the Taoiseach. The workers were no longer willing to take the Minister&rsquo;s word. The Taoiseach intervened on 17 March and gave a clear undertaking to the workers that the business and <Col N="1171"/>commercial information associated with the proposed break up of Aer Rianta would be made available to the unions at an early date. He specifically gave an undertaking that he would provide ample time for consideration of those figures prior to the publication of the State airports Bill.</P>
        <P>It is six weeks since the strike was called off. The Minister says he intends to introduce this legislation before the end of this session, which is the beginning of July. That does not leave much time for the unions to consider that information. It has been suggested that the Minister is trying to provoke strike action by his behaviour. Why has the information not been provided? What is the reason for the delay? When does the Minister expect to make that information available to the unions, as promised by the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the sale of Aer Lingus, has the Department carried out an analysis of whether a trade sale of part of the company or a public offering of part of the shareholding in the company is the preferred option? What is the Minister&rsquo;s preference between those two alternatives or is there another option for the sale of the company?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has provided the financial information to the financial advisers for the trade unions and to identified trade union officials, in view of the commercial sensitivity of some of the information. I look forward to taking on board, in so far as I can, what the unions suggest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What timeframe is the Minister allowing for a response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked that they come back to me in the next two weeks with their views on the financial information. The information is straightforward. It is laid out in working papers prepared by PricewaterhouseCooper and other financial advisers. It indicates projections for the three airports. The information is not a great secret in many ways. It indicates that Shannon and Cork airports will continue to be under pressure, which is the reason I want to do this. They should have a fresh start. It also indicates that Dublin Airport is under performing in terms of revenue with the number of passengers increasing and profits decreasing. There is, therefore, a need for action. I hope to take on board, in a sensible way, the reports from the trade unions.</P>
        <P>I am not trying to provoke industrial action. At the same time, however, I will not be intimidated by suggestions of action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 82 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>Over the years various changes have been made to the regulatory conditions under which provisional licences have effect. I am considering whether further changes are desirable in this regard. In particular, I wish to bring in measures that will reduce long-term reliance on provisional licences. I am also reviewing the provision whereby holders of second provisional licences for cars are not required to be accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for that category of vehicle, with a view to ending this arrangement. All other provisional licence holders, other than drivers of motorcycles and work vehicles, must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times when driving in a public place.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am considering, in consultation with motor cycling interests and the insurance industry, measures to improve the training and safety of motor cyclists, especially those on provisional licences. I intend to submit detailed proposals for a package of driver licensing reforms to Government shortly. I envisage these proposals would be implemented on a phased basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will agree that urgent action is required to address the 13-month backlog. Only 18 months ago the average waiting time was ten weeks. Is the Minister aware that not having a full driving licence is costing young drivers approximately &euro;50 million per year in increased premia? Particularly in rural areas it is depriving people of job opportunities and hence the need for urgent reform. Will the Minister comment on the eight driving tester vacancies that remain to be filled? I understand if these eight appointments were made, those testers could carry out approximately 15,300 tests per <Col N="1173"/>annum, which would greatly alleviate the backlog.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill to establish the new driver testing and standards authority have been approved by Cabinet and the drafting of the Bill is being finalised. I have had discussions with some civil servants who are due to move to that authority. It is my intention that the authority would deal with the backlog in an aggressive way as soon as it is operational. I am seeking to have the eight vacancies filled as soon as possible. I agree with the Deputy that this will make a difference. Approximately 370,000 people currently hold provisional licences. A considerable number of those hold second or subsequent provisional licences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the Minister is now trying to pass responsibility for the backlog to the new authority. However, is it not the case that the Minister caused the backlog in the first place by his irresponsible comments? What specific actions will the Minister take to address the problem? He is thinking about appointing eight people to fill the tester vacancies. Will he introduce a bonus scheme in the summer and not in the autumn as he did last year, when it was not possible to provide any additional tests as they had to take place during daylight hours? Would it not make more sense to have it in place this summer so that we could clear some of the backlog?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Some drivers with provisional licences are currently driving HGVs and buses. Given the high number of HGVs involved in road accidents the Minister should give priority to testing those on provisional licences driving such dangerous vehicles. A further category of people had previously got driving licences, which lapsed because of the casual attitude to driving licences that had developed in the country. This category includes the Taoiseach. Many experienced drivers who had been driving for many years let their licences lapse. Does the Minister intend making any special provision for those people or will they have to undergo a test again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Driving testers are conducting a total of 4,000 tests per week. We introduced a bonus scheme last year, which helped substantially. I intend to introduce another bonus scheme and fill these eight vacancies. However this will only really start when the new authority takes office.</P>
        <P>Of 1.8 million vehicles in the State, 1.4 million are motorcars. This leaves approximately 400,000 motorcycles and HGVs. I believe the number of motorcycles is approximately 50,000 or 60,000. This means there are about 300,000 HGVs. I can get a more accurate figure for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want an accurate figure. I am asking the Minister to give priority to <Col N="1174"/>arranging tests for those on provisional licences driving HGVs, a large number of whom end up involved in traffic accidents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can take a look at that. The applications for driving tests are dealt with in rotation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it acceptable for a person on a provisional licence to drive an HGV?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. Nor is it acceptable that those on fourth or fifth provisional licences are driving around the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What will the Minister do about it?</P>
      </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the commission on electronic voting has highlighted the arrogance and incompetence of the Government and was a devastating indictment of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The commission was given narrow terms of reference, which covered just three issues: accuracy, secrecy and testing. The Government&rsquo;s proposal was found inadequate in all three.</P>
      <P>This expensive fiasco represents gross incompetence by the Government collectively and by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on an individual basis. The Government would not listen to appeals from the Opposition for more debate and would not listen to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, when Deputy Allen tried to have these issues discussed with outside experts. It would not listen to the advice given by independent IT experts, who expressed serious reservations about its plans. We all have to endure political charge. However the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, disgracefully attacked many of those independent experts as Luddites and anti-globalisation agitators.</P>
      <P>The Government is now adopting a classic ostrich-like approach to this report and trying to pretend that the commission was only concerned with a few minor technical points, which can easily be resolved. Would the Taoiseach now accept his proposal for electronic voting is dead in the water? Will the Government now drop the Electoral (Amendment) Bill from the Order Paper and agree to introduce a fully independent electoral commission to be responsible for the running of all future elections, including the introduction of an electronic voting system, which would enjoy complete public trust and support?</P>

The commission also stated that experts retained by the commission confirmed that the system accurately and consistently counted votes at the pilot elections, which have <Col N="1176"/>already been carried out. The commission concluded that there was not sufficient time to carry out comprehensive additional testing to provide sufficient positive assurance on the system before the June elections.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach is well aware that the Commission on Electronic Voting was established only in response to a motion in this House which was tabled by Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party. Had it not been for that motion and the pressure on the Government, the Taoiseach would have pressed ahead with a flawed system of voting in the June elections. During the debate on that motion, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said, &ldquo;I stress that the electronic voting system is secure, reliable and can be trusted by the people,&rdquo; but the commission said that was not the case. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that this would be the most accurate and, <Col N="1177"/>therefore, the most democratic system we have ever had. He stated that the system is secure, reliable and can be trusted by the people, but the commission thought otherwise.</P>

	<P>The commission has stated that its experts have been involved in carrying out <Col N="1181"/>testing. It has examined the voting machines and the counting software, including the parallel testing and can confirm that the system can accurately and concisely record voter preferences. The commission has not been able, within the timeframe of its report, to satisfy itself sufficiently as to the accuracy and secrecy of the system to be deployed in June for three reasons: the count and management software has been updated many times during the past three years and the impact of these successive modifications cannot be fully tested in the period set out; it has not been possible for it to obtain access to the full system source code &mdash; a matter which has since been dealt with; and, the system has not been certified as being suitable to use in the Irish context by an accredited testing and certification authority.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, additional time for testing of the system is required. The company involved is an internationally tested, reputable company which must convince the commission of the validity of all its operations. That will take some months. In the meantime, the system will not be used in the forthcoming elections. The Government will ensure all issues raised by the commission and its advisers will be satisfactorily dealt with. It is unfortunate the system will not be used in the forthcoming elections. However, elections come and go and the machines, when rectified to the commission&rsquo;s satisfaction, will be used in subsequent elections.</P>

We know from a reply to a parliamentary question last week that &euro;52 million has now gone down the drain.</P>
      <P>We also know that the Taoiseach, from the summary he gave the House, misrepresents the electoral commission&rsquo;s findings. It clearly stated that the Government was prepared to proceed with a system the accuracy of which nobody could certify following exposure that the software version proposed has not yet been finalised.

It is to the advantage of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure that so many major and minor infrastructural projects are under way. Many of these are being commissioned this year and many others will be <Col N="1185"/>commissioned next year. The related equipment, staffing and non-pay costs must be built into them. This is an ongoing issue between the Departments of Health and Children and Finance.</P>

	<P>What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intentions regarding the request of the Minister for Health and Children? It is the collective view of the House that the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance should respond positively to the Minister&rsquo;s request. Can the Taoiseach not accept the public cynicism at the continual utterances of Government representatives in the weeks remaining before the local and European elections on 11 June, given all we have heard regarding this and other matters?</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not also accept that this matter exposes the absence of coherence in the Government&rsquo;s health policy? We have a significant investment of &euro;400 million in capital projects but we are not prepared to resource them in order to see them open and giving the services for which they were intended.</P>
      <P>In response to a question I asked him last week, the Taoiseach indicated that he welcomed the fact that fewer people had medical cards as an indication of a decrease in unemployment. At the same time he went on to say he would like to see more people having medical cards. Can the Taoiseach clarify whether or not he accepts the existence of real suffering, particularly among families with children, and the urgent need to increase the threshold for qualification for medical cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asks if resources are likely to be allocated. In the last seven years the health budget has increased by 20% per year. There has been an increase of 188% in the health budget since 1997. The health service is extraordinarily well resourced. The Government now spends &euro;10.5 billion on health. This has nothing to do with what will happen in the next six weeks. The Minister for Health and Children is planning the opening, equipping and staffing of units in 2005 and an ongoing programme of major infrastructural development involving approximately 20 large projects throughout the country. This is an ongoing task.</P>
      <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s ongoing intention to increase the number of medical cards during the life of this Government when resources permit.</P>

	<P>I object.

I cannot understand how he has the neck to press ahead with Report Stage of the Bill when it totally lacks credibility. The Taoiseach was very selective when quoting from the Bill. He did not mention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am indicating that I object to taking Report Stage. The Minister has lost all credibility. He has had an arrogant attitude to the issues raised by Opposition spokespersons and the experts who attended the hearing at the request of the Minister and the committee on 18 December last. Following the hearing of 18 December, questions under the 41 headings raised by experts were not answered for more than a month by officials of the Department. It went from December to February before answers were given to some of the questions raised. I know what happened. The committee adjourned for lunch and the whip of the Department got an instruction to collapse the committee&rsquo;s hearing. That afternoon, by weight of numbers, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats rushed through a motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have submitted to your office a motion seeking the recommittal of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 to Committee Stage. Do I move the recommittal if it is agreed that Report Stage be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That cannot be moved until we are on Report Stage. As soon as we are on Report Stage, we will take the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I oppose the taking of Report Stage because the Minister presenting the Bill should no longer be the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Last autumn he refused to listen to the views of the Opposition parties and to technical experts who told him then much the same as the Commission on Electronic Voting <Col N="1198"/>told him at the end of last week. Had he listened then to what we had to say, we might have made a lot more progress on this issue and it would not have resulted in the taxpayer being charged &euro;52 million for this political adventure. His failure to listen then was a display of arrogance. His spending of &euro;52 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money was reckless and proceeding with an electronic voting system which the commission has criticised in such stark terms was absolutely irresponsible.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister directly and without personal rancour that since last Friday he should have either resigned his office as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or he should have been sacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I also oppose the taking of Report Stage because the context of the Bill has now entirely changed. The commission has reported and this item is on the Order Paper today because the Government was in such a hurry to get the electronic voting system in place for 11 June. It cannot now be used on 11 June and therefore the time of this House would be better spent debating Bills that are of importance to people such as Report Stage of the Residential Tenancies Bill, for which we have been waiting since last February and was shunted into a siding in order that the Minister could proceed with the electronic voting legislation.</P>
      <P>In any event, the issues which now arise in regard to electronic voting cannot be addressed in the confines of a Report Stage debate. The issues reported on by the commission now need a proper Committee Stage-type debate. Therefore, the Labour Party opposes the taking of Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is somewhat surreal that the House is being asked to debate Report Stage of a Bill which no longer has any meaning. It certainly has no sense of urgency given that the purpose for which it was introduced on a very rushed basis through Second Stage, Committee Stage and the proposed Report Stage no longer exists. The report of the independent commission gives a reason that this Bill should be agreed in some element by this House eventually, but it is not required now, namely, that the commission desires to be placed on a statutory basis, about which no one in this House would argue.</P>
      <P>During the course of this Bill, the Minister has displayed behaviour which indicates he is guilty of either gross arrogance or technological illiteracy. Given his stance on other issues &mdash; I cited the example of incineration &mdash; he is more guilty of the latter. It is only a matter of weeks since a vote of no confidence in the Minister was tabled in this House. He managed to get the support of those who sit figuratively and metaphorically behind him in the House. However, if that same vote were put today would the Minister have the same confidence of this <Col N="1199"/>House? On those grounds we should not proceed with this farce of a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s proposal to recommit this legislation to Committee Stage. The system we have debated and attempted to amend in the past few weeks is not now in place. It is effectively off the agenda having been totally and absolutely discredited. During the course of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill the Minister undertook that if this system collapsed or failed he would take full responsibility for it. That is what has happened &mdash; the system has failed us and therefore I ask the Minister to accept his undertaking on Committee Stage to take full responsibility for it. The door is up above and I urge him to move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself between the usual rock and hard place because I have no doubt that if I came to the House this afternoon to announce that I was pulling the Bill there would be uproar from the Opposition for the reason that the Commission on Electronic Voting needs to be put <Col N="1200"/>on a statutory basis. The commission in its report urges this House to get on with the job of ensuring its position is secure by putting it on a statutory footing. That is the basis of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Members opposite know that the Bill deals with issues in the forthcoming elections other than electronic voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister saw no need for a Bill a month ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It deals with personation and the facilitation of a number of existing councillors who are council employees and are standing in the forthcoming elections. It is also important to point out that the provisions in the Bill on electronic voting provide a regulatory framework only. They can be enacted in the knowledge that the commission will continue to do its work in respect of the secrecy and accuracy of the system. That is why we need to proceed with the Bill and the commission has asked us to proceed immediately with the Bill to put it on a statutory footing. That is why the proposal to proceed is before the House.</P>

  <MainHeading LHead="Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004:" RHead="Report Stage" Type="GD">
    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004: Report Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That, having regard to the findings of the Commission on Electronic Voting on the secrecy, accuracy and testing of the chosen electronic voting system, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 be recommitted in its entirety.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Bill is before the House because the Government has been in a mad rush to get the electronic voting system in place for 11 June. The Committee Stage debate, which took place last week, took place prior to the interim report of the Commission on Electronic Voting. That report changes the context for the Bill. First, electronic voting will not be used on 11 June. Second, there are issues which arise from the report of the commission which require the Bill to be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On pages 12 and 13 of the commission&rsquo;s report, there are comments by the commission on its terms of reference. The terms of reference for the commission, when established on a statutory basis, are contained in a Schedule to the Bill. The implications of the comments by the commission in its report relating to its terms of reference would require amendments to be tabled to the Bill. For example, the commission states: &ldquo;Issues such as the existence of a voter verifiable audit trail, the removal of the possibility of abstaining or spoiling a vote, voter acceptance of the system, alternative electronic voting systems and issues surrounding the procurement of the chosen system and the procurement of previous testing of the system were outside the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference&rdquo;. It appears, given the comments made by the commission, that the terms of reference for the commission, which are <Col N="1202"/>contained in a Schedule to the Bill, need to be amended, thus requiring a recommittal.</P>
      <P>Other issues have been raised by the commission which require a Committee Stage type debate. For example, the finding by the commission that &ldquo;the system has not been tested as a whole or certified as being suitable for use in an Irish electoral context by an accredited testing and certification authority&rdquo; would require a Committee Stage amendment, as would the finding that: &ldquo;certain of the tests performed at the request of the Commission identified an error in the count software which could lead to incorrect distributions of surpluses; there is a possibility that further testing will uncover further software errors;&rdquo;. The finding, which is alarming, that:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . there is a possibility of interference with the voting machine, ballot module and hardened PC:</P>
     <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>in particular, experts retained by the Commission found it very easy to bypass electronic security measures and gain complete control of the &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; PC, overwrite the software, and thereby in theory to gain complete control over the count in a given constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to a brief comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving examples of the issues which are raised in the interim report of the Commission on Electronic Voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point, but they might be more appropriate when the debate proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1203"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for a general debate when a Member opposes an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are so many issues and so many criticisms made of this electronic voting system by the commission that I would detain the House a long time if I were to go through them all. Therefore, I do not propose to do that. We were not aware of all these issues in the report of the commission when we debated the Bill on Committee Stage. Report Stage amendments arise out of Committee Stage debate. It is not possible to have these issues addressed on Report Stage and, for those reasons, I ask that the Bill in its entirety be recommitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, how can the views or comments for a general debate take place on Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I said there could not be a general debate on a proposal dealing with how we do our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be very brief. It is really a matter for the proposer and the respondent from the Government side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>When I opposed the taking of Report Stage, the Chair continued to interrupt me. I hope I get some order at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair never interrupts; it intervenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair intervened continuously and interrupted me. I agree with what Deputy Gilmore has said. The Taoiseach said earlier that the commission had further work to do. That may be so but its work will be ineffective because the Taoiseach should realise that the narrow terms of reference of the commission makes it impossible for it to deal with a number of issues, one of which is the question of the verifiable paper audit trail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing whether the Bill should be recommitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is compounding the litany of errors in which the Government has involved itself by expecting the commission to continue its work, despite its narrow terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1204"/>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gilmore and suggest the detailed discussion we might have here is akin to a debate and discussion as to what music should be played on the <i>Titanic.</i> Given that a dramatic decision has been made and a dramatic report has been published, we should not proceed on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The only way to get this right is to begin again. That is clear from the comments of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Morgan speak without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Try to get it right the next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The best message I could hear from the Government side of the House would be that the Minister was resigning, which is what he undertook to do on Committee Stage. Given that he will not do that and that the Taoiseach appears unwilling to dispatch him, we will have to carry on with this legislation. I support the motion from Deputy Gilmore that the Bill be recommitted because we are starting from scratch. If only the Minister had consulted from the beginning, this problem would not have arisen. In the absence of that consultation, we are in a cul-de-sac with this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have already stated, it was my understanding that the Opposition fully supported the view that the commission should be put on a statutory footing. That was the starting point in all of this and a core reason for the debate and the legislation. It is quite clear from the report that the commission wants to see that promise fulfilled as quickly as possible. I have no doubt if I told the House this afternoon that the Government was not proceeding with the legislation, there would be uproar on the other side of the House and the Opposition would accuse me of trying to undermine the commission. The games are over. The Government will proceed on the commitment given that the commission would be set up on a statutory basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 5, after &ldquo;TO&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;ESTABLISH A BODY TO BE KNOWN AS AN COIMISI&Uacute;N UM V&Oacute;T&Aacute;IL LEICTREONACH, OR IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, THE COMMISSION ON ELECTRONIC VOTING, AND TO&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1206"/>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to provide for an Irish title for the Commission on Electronic Voting. In his response to my earlier motion, which I regret was not accepted, the Minister stated that his reason for proceeding with the Bill today was the requirement that the commission be established on a statutory basis. While I accept that this is the case, this could be achieved by dealing separately with Part 3 of the Bill which deals with the establishment of the commission. The Labour Party would probably agree if the Minister were to make such a proposal.</P><Col N="1207"/>
      <P>The House and the country owe a debt of gratitude to the commission which was established at a time of political conflict and partisan views in the House on the proposed electronic voting system. This was no fault of Deputies on this side who sought at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to persuade the Government to approach the issue on an all-party basis. The Government decided unilaterally to proceed with the system and ran into difficulty. As Deputies Kenny and Allen reminded the House, it was only on foot of a motion tabled by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Green Party that it was eventually forced to establish the commission.</P>
      <P>The members of the commission were given the difficult job of reporting on the electronic voting system selected within a difficult timeframe, a fact to which they drew attention in their report. The commission was also given limited terms of reference and correctly drew attention in its report to these limitations, which prevented it from examining anything other than the system of electronic voting already chosen by the Government. This precluded it, for example, from examining the issue of a voter verifiable audit trail and other matters. While not stated bluntly, it broadly hints in its report that it would like its terms of reference changed to enable it to examine wider issues.</P>
      <P>In the report submitted to the Ceann Comhairle last Friday, the commission did a service to democracy by asserting and exercising its independence and severely criticising the proposed system of electronic voting. The report echoes the criticisms contained in a document produced by the Labour Party last autumn and ridiculed by the Minister at the time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has many questions to answer about his stewardship of this issue. Deputies have referred to his stewardship of expenditure on the system, for which he did not have authority. At the time he committed expenditure, primary legislation allowing him to do so had not been enacted. The legislation in question is the Bill which would allow electronic voting to be used in the local and European Parliament elections. Despite the fact that it had not been enacted, the Minister proceeded to spend &euro;52 million of taxpayer&rsquo;s money. He had no authority to do so and has not yet made himself accountable to the House.</P>
      <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>  
      <P>The Minister repeatedly assured the House and the committee examining the issue that the system chosen was safe and reliable and had been thoroughly tested. It was a matter of placing our trust in him. The assurances the Minister gave this House were blown out of the water last Friday when the commission published its report. The software has not yet been fully developed for this system. The commission stated that as the software version proposed for use in the forthcoming elections is as yet unknown, it is <Col N="1208"/>impossible for anyone to certify its accuracy. There are also issues of secrecy. An individual voter could effectively be intimidated or corrupted while casting a vote. An insider could overcome the random methods used for the storage of votes in the ballot module. The people engaged by the commission were able to bypass the security measures and gain complete control of the PC. The count could be manipulated. All these issues were raised either by Members in the various debates in the House or in the committee, or were raised by technical experts who made submissions to the committee. These concerns were flatly denied by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I recommend the amendment but this debate is surreal. We are debating a Bill to enable something to take place that cannot take place. This is happening against a background of misinformation given to the House previously by the Minister. In my speech on Second Stage, I wondered aloud what this was all about. Why was Fianna F&aacute;il so anxious to get a system of electronic voting into place? We suspected at the time that it was seriously flawed and now we know from the commission report that it was seriously flawed. We are owed an explanation and the commission is owed the gratitude of the House and of the country for blowing the whistle on such a flawed system of electronic voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to pay tribute to the commission. I asked how it could carry out its work in the short time span and narrow terms of reference that it had. Yet it did an effective job and upheld many of the reservations raised by Members and experts outside the House. The Minister should make some apologies. He got an opportunity on Committee Stage to apologise to the people whom he described as part of the anti-globalisation movement. There is a letter of complaint to the Ceann Comhairle from the Irish Computer Society regarding comments made by the Minister. That was one small example of the contempt that the Minister had for anyone who dared question his good judgement. His judgement is now as low as his credibility. He should be big enough to apologise, before he is forced to do so, to the Irish Computer Society for his remarks in this House. There is an old clich&eacute; that the best form of defence is attack. I protested that people were being attacked who could not defend themselves. I hope the Ceann Comhairle will force the Minister to apologise.</P>
      <P>The events of recent months have shown a high level of naivet&eacute; on the part of the Minister, followed by incompetence. He continued to press ahead with a system that was known by those who researched it to have problems. That incompetence was followed by arrogance, where everyone who raised concerns was criticised for being Luddites and yesterday&rsquo;s people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should stick to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1209"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was then followed by negligence. The amendment should be accepted. It is incredible that the Government decided to press ahead with Report Stage in spite of all that happened. It is now time for reflection and to figure out how best to go forward. I thought the Minister should have learned his lesson last Friday following the publication of the report. He should have insisted that we work together on this to bring forward a safe, secure system that has the people&rsquo;s trust. The Minister continues to ride a bicycle with the back wheel punctured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say it was buckled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>He is continuing on, but this puncture will cause the wheel to buckle. He should get off the bicycle and consult all parties on how best to advance a suitable system for our democracy. It is not too late. We must re-examine the terms of reference for the commission. The Taoiseach added insult to injury when he stated that the commission could continue with its work. With its limited terms of reference, it will not be able to bring forward the work that is required to gain the confidence of the people.</P>
      <P>The process must be removed from the political realm. The Minister should relinquish his position as the person driving this legislation. The future role of an electoral commission should be examined. Why should there be so many commissions examining different issues concerning elections? Why is there no independent statutory commission which would have the terms of reference to examine boundaries, the way elections are run, and the issue of standards in public office? Control over the management of elections should be removed from the Department. There is an ongoing conflict of interest in the Minister&rsquo;s position which has been increased by his being director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il in the local elections on 11 June.</P>
      <P>It is time to call a halt to the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money as this will keep going otherwise. The Minister says these machines will be viable or operable for the next 20 years. The cost of storage of the machines while they are not in use and their future is being decided must be considered. There are other major costs associated with this. The commission stated in its report that the issues concerning the storage and security of the machines, whether in use or not, must be addressed.</P>
      <P>It is time to call a halt and reflect. Let us all have space. The Minister has the guarantee of my party that if some respect is shown for the Opposition parties, those parties will respond in a mature way. We are not all out to play political games at all times, as the Minister might think. We will be responsible and we can go forward together to bring forth an acceptable system that everybody will trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a time for reflection and a time to pause. The science of report writing is a sober one. One must put down one&rsquo;s recommendations on paper quite cautiously and carefully. Section 4.4 of the report, which lists recommendations for action, states quite carefully that we should be quite cautious in proceeding with electronic voting. However, the most damning part of the report is the page on other issues which precedes this section. An entire page of the report is devoted to these. The language in the report is screaming at us to stop, go back and reconsider. This is the lesson that must be learned from it. My party believes an independent electoral commission is necessary if we are to have confidence restored in the electronic voting system. It is incumbent on the Minister to provide vision rather than continue on the route he has taken until now.</P>
      <P>There are small parts of this legislation that need to be in place for the election in five weeks&rsquo; time. I am happy about this, but the Minister should pull back and set up an all-party committee or procedure to allow for the kind of input evident in the submissions received and to feed into a review of the voting system. A total of 162 submissions were made by some of the best and brightest brains in Ireland who approached the issue from technical and political points of view among others. The majority of these individuals advised that we should proceed cautiously and carefully and many stated we should have an independent electoral commission. Rather than simply criticise the Minister, and there has been enough criticism of him, we should move on. We need to see some commitment on the part of the Minister to set up an independent electoral commission. This would start to restore confidence lost due to the fiasco of recent years.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take on board Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s amendment which refers to the highest standards of transparency and accountability. We can only achieve these by pulling back and re-examining the entire process. I thank the commission for its work. It produced a carefully worded document. Each of the paragraphs on page 23 is a tremendous addition to what we know about electronic voting and each needs to be taken on board by the Minister&rsquo;s Department. I hope we will start from scratch again and I encourage the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment and welcome the opportunity we now have to stand back, re-examine the legislation and consider what is really needed in terms of putting in place a proper voting system. If the Minister wants to avoid further disaster, he will consider carefully the proposition on offering support put by a number of people, not least of whom is Deputy Allen. I, too, would offer support in working constructively with the Government to make sure we get this right.</P><Col N="1211"/>
      <P>I noted how this matter can cause vexation in the Chamber. When Deputy Durkan was making his point of order, he reminded me of a fellow at the back of the dance hall years ago who was about to throw off his coat. I refer to a reasonable man who wants to work with the Minister to try produce something sensible rather than fight with him. As I stated, we welcome that the Government has abandoned its plans to introduce electronic voting in the forthcoming election following the publication of the findings of the commission on electronic voting. It was surprising that the Government took so long to take that decision given the overwhelming concerns that existed about the secrecy and accuracy of the system it proposes to use. These concerns were voiced by a broad spectrum of people, including independent software experts from outside the House. The magnitude of the Minister&rsquo;s arrogance in this matter was on a grand scale.</P>
      <P>There was real concern for a while in my party that the Government might try to ignore the commission&rsquo;s findings and plough ahead with the introduction of electronic voting in June. Again, I welcome the Government announcement to put it on hold. In the absence of a voter-verified paper audit trail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I kept my word on the commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made another commitment on Committee Stage also. In any event, we will let him consider that himself.</P>
      <P>The absence of a voter-verified paper audit trail and the failure to publish the source code represented fatal flaws in the proposed system of electronic voting. I hope we can start again, engage in consultation, solve this problem together and create what everybody wants, namely, a fair and open system for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>While I join other Deputies in thanking the commission for its report, unfortunately I do not share their optimism in believing we can stand back because the Government intends to give people space and re-examine the issue. What occurred during the Order of Business only reinforces my suspicion that the Government intends or wants to proceed, irrespective of the views of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated during Leaders&rsquo; Questions that it was only in mid-January, when a row started about electronic voting in America, that people in this country began to question our electronic voting system. I had no opportunity to advise the Taoiseach at the time but I advise him now to consult the minutes of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government of 18 December, in which he will note the serious concerns outlined and ignored by the Minister on that occasion. On 18 February, on the all-party motion on electronic voting, I <Col N="1212"/>alluded to the fact that it is the people who will thwart the attempts to introduce electronic voting because the essence of power rests with them. As a result of that D&aacute;il debate, the Government, in the absence of the Minister who was abroad at the time, conceded to the establishment of the commission that has now made its report. It is a pity the Minister was not abroad on more occasions because we might have made more progress on this matter. That was the only progress made since the committee debate in December. On 18 February, reluctantly and at the eleventh hour, the Government conceded the establishment of a commission. It was, possibly, rumblings in the minor Government party which led to that concession. Either way, we were lucky to get it.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party has consistently advised the Minister to ensure everything is in order before introducing electronic voting. We said at the committee meetings that we would like to emerge fully supportive of the Minister in its introduction. However, there was too much bulldozing, too many unanswered questions and too many disparaging remarks about the case we made. I will not quote some of the remarks made by the Minister during D&aacute;il debates about the Opposition and, particularly, the attitude of Fine Gael. Some very disparaging remarks were made for which he should have the grace to apologise. What we were saying has now beem included in the commission&rsquo;s report.</P>
      <P>The conclusion of the commission&rsquo;s report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">On the basis of its review of expert reports, submissions received and other relevant information to date, the Commission finds that it is not in a position to recommend with the requisite degree of confidence the use of the chosen system at elections in Ireland in June 2004.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is exactly what we said. The public did not have confidence in it because of its lack of knowledge about it and the way it was bulldozed through by the Government. The commission also said: &ldquo;In addition, the commission recognises that the threshold of proof required&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Deputy not read the next paragraph? Why did he skip it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Minister during his contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is his problem; he will not listen.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is only tightening the noose around his neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister continues with that attitude, I despair of him doing anything to correct the mess he is in. He has displayed arrogance throughout the debates on this issue. It was evident at the committee meeting on 18 <Col N="1213"/>December when experts from both sides, departmental officials and representatives of the manufacturers of the equipment appeared before the committee to discuss the issue and answer questions. We should have been allowed to continue that meeting on the afternoon of 18 December but Government members of the committee suddenly put a motion before the committee which resulted in the collapse of the meeting ten minutes after it had resumed its deliberations after lunch. The committee had intended to sit all day.</P>
      <P>The contract was signed the next day, 19 December. We subsequently discovered that &euro;20 million worth of the machines had been imported two months before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should address the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>This concerns its essence. If there is a statutory commission to deal with this and remove it from the Minister&rsquo;s hands, there might be an opportunity to generate a consensus which would permit the introduction of electronic voting.</P>
      <P>Nobody has a difficulty with electronic voting <i>per se</i>. The &euro;5 million spent by the public relations company showing people how to switch off electric lights and press buttons was irrelevant to the debate. Everybody knows how to do that. The relevant issue in the debate was the trust people had in the method of voting at elections and the trust, or mainly lack of it, people had in the Government parties which were pushing this through despite the reservations of the Opposition and, more importantly, people outside politics who were experts in information technology. They had far more knowledge than us and were, and still are, extremely sceptical about this.</P>
      <P>Eventually, the media, the Joe Duffy programme and everybody else forced the Government to set up the commission which has now rejected what the Minister tried to bulldoze through. Originally, he did not even concede that legislation was necessary. He eventually conceded that it was. Bit by bit, he is being forced to climb down on this issue. He should be more careful and a little more conciliatory about the valid points being made about the mess he is in. There is an old saying that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging. If the Minister would stop digging, it might be more helpful to the cause he is promoting.</P>

	<P>My opinion is clear. I have listened to members of the public at meetings and other places. They wonder how one can trust, after the exposure of what happened in political circles over the last ten years, any Fianna F&aacute;il Minister or Government to introduce electronic voting without believing &mdash; I am only quoting the general opinion &mdash; that there is some fiddle attached to it. That is what the people are saying. That is the reality of the situation in which the Minister finds himself with regard to electronic voting.</P>
      <P>I will not waste time because the Minister is anxious to reply. If he starts well by agreeing to amendment No. 1, a reasonable proposal, we can have a short Report Stage debate on this important issue.</P>

	<P>The scaffold was only half built when they had to leave. It is truly farcical to have D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the representative assembly of the nation, tied up for hours today and on further days discussing this Bill for nothing when so many pressing issues should be brought before the D&aacute;il. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is like a man at the church door, about to be married, but unable to get his bride to be to the church on time &mdash; she is locked up in a storeroom somewhere &mdash; and yet he insists on putting us through the ceremony anyway. Talk about being all dressed up and nowhere to go.</P>
      <P>This is a farce. A number of Deputies have mentioned the word &ldquo;surreal&rdquo; and it is true. In <i>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, the Cheshire cat begins to disappear in the course of the story and all that is eventually left is a grin. The reason for this Bill has disappeared; it has melted before our faces. All we are left with is the Bill and another bill to the taxpayer for &euro;50 million. It is incredible. We could debate a disability Bill or a Bill controlling land prices. There are a number of issues that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann could debate profitably. However, sitting for days on end to deal with a matter that is now irrelevant as far as the local and European elections in June are concerned is outrageous.</P>
      <P>It is becoming characteristic of this Minister that he is increasingly involved with matters that turn out to be posthumous. He has wasted &euro;1.5 <Col N="1215"/>million on an advertising campaign called &ldquo;Race Against Waste&rdquo; based on fraudulent impressions being given to frighten the public into paying his double taxes. If we had any effective leadership in Government, the Minister would not be sitting where he is at present. We would have someone else who would be trying to withdraw this Bill as gracefully as possible. I agree with the Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s amendment that &ldquo;AN COIMISI&Uacute;N UM V&Oacute;T&Aacute;IL LEICTREONACH&rdquo; should be inserted in the title.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in thanking the commission for its work. It vindicated the view I expressed to the commission that its members would be very independent in the exercise of their duties. Everybody would accept that they have done that, which I welcome. The report is an important contribution to the debate on this issue and in many respects is very helpful. It is important that people read this report in its totality. I would not like to put on record the number of times I have read the report.</P>

	<P>The Minister could not believe it the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read it in great detail to try to understand the issues the commission has raised. I would like to put on the record the paragraph that Deputy McCormack left out, which is singularly significant. The commission went out of its way to ensure it was upfront in its executive summary by stating:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Commission wishes to emphasise that its conclusion is not based on any finding that the system will not work, but on the finding that it has not been proven at this time to the satisfaction of the Commission that it will work.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is where we lie at the moment. As other Members placed much on the record, I also wish to put on the record the commission&rsquo;s own findings as there is an important reason it did this. The commission&rsquo;s report states:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">testing carried out by experts retained by the Commission on a significant sample of the voting machines deployed to returning officers confirms that the system can accurately and consistently record voter preferences;</P><Col N="1216"/>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">testing of the counting software carried out by experts retained by the Commission using voting information from pilot tests during previous elections in Ireland confirms that it accurately counted the votes recorded at these elections;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">parallel testing of the counting software programme carried out by experts retained by the Commission using a large number of sample data sets and a similar counting programme developed for the Commission confirms that it can accurately count votes in most situations, including unusual or difficult electoral situations;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">miniature end-to-end testing of the system carried out by experts retained by the Commission confirms that it can accurately record and count the votes in the context of multiple simultaneous elections.</P>
      <P FLI="0">They are pretty definitive on much of the testing the commission carried out. The report made little or no criticism of the machines. The commission seemed to concentrate on the software, the counting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is quite correct. It is an interesting point which needs to be teased out with the commission. On the point the commission raised about the error which it said occurred in the machine, the only one of which I was aware was the one about which the Department informed the commission which was an infinitesimal difference on a decimal point. The commission was informed that had been corrected. As I understand it, it had no bearing in any real sense on the distribution of votes. We must keep matters in perspective when considering exactly what has been said. That is important to record. Equally, it is fine by me if the commission rightly says it would have preferred if all testing had finished a month ago. The commission is of the opinion that we should not be testing this close to the elections, which is a criticism I accept. I accept also that the commission&rsquo;s view differs from that of the Department that one should continue to test. I will not argue a reasonable point which is fairly <Col N="1218"/>made. However, the commission&rsquo;s net point is that it wants time to perform testing of the kind which has already been carried out. The most significant end-to-end testing of the entire system was carried out in real time in a real live scenario by its use in a number of constituencies in the previous general election. It was used in a further number of constituencies during a referendum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tried to listen carefully to what every Member of the Opposition has said. Is the Opposition saying now that it wishes to stand down the commission? Do I understand this correctly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister want an answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Allen will have an opportunity to speak. We are on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will wait a minute. I ask the question on the basis of my understanding from what all the Deputies have said that the Opposition wants the commission to be stood down. According to Opposition Members, the commission has done its work and a different type of body should be established. If I am right in saying that, I need it to be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is moving the goalposts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Opposition is not saying what I have outlined, it answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should stick with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore implies he is not saying that. That is fair enough. As the Opposition knows, we must pursue this legislation as we guaranteed the commission that we would place it on a statutory footing. This Bill provides the framework to accomplish that. While it sets out a framework for the use of electronic voting in all circumstances, the Bill does not specify the type of system to be used. Equally, the legislation deals with matters imminent in the local elections, including the eligibility or otherwise of local government employees to stand. It deals also with the issue of personation with polling cards which I thought all Members wished to see addressed. I am happy to deal with those issues. That is why we are here to debate the Bill. Members should be clear that a guarantee was given to the commission and that we wish to fulfil it. The commission feels it should be placed on a statutory footing and the <Col N="1219"/>Government has no difficulty with making the necessary provisions.</P>
      <P>For the sake of clarity, I wish to record that I made an inadvertent remark about the Irish Computer Society. I had not intended to cause offence and I wish to withdraw the remark I made.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is technical and seeks to include additional text in the long title which makes reference to the commission on electronic voting. The amendment is not considered necessary. The title of the commission is included in both languages in section 17 of the Bill. The parliamentary counsel is the expert in drawing up the Long Titles of Bills. The Long Title of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 was prepared by the counsel and is considered satisfactory. On that basis, I ask Deputy Gilmore to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it remarkable that the Minister has shifted ground. The original purpose of this Bill was to introduce electronic voting on 11 June. That is the reason it was hurriedly brought to the House. Time was taken up on Second Stage which the House could more usefully have used to consider legislation to address tenants rights, the price of land and houses and the other urgent, inadequately dealt with issues which come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Government&rsquo;s hurry to introduce electronic voting was the reason the Bill was on Committee Stage last week. The ink was hardly dry on amendments made on Committee Stage before the Bill was brought back to the House on Report Stage. The Minister is now telling the House that the Bill is not really about electronic voting. He says it is about putting the commission on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>As far as the Minister was concerned, the commission was always incidental to the entire issue. It was an afterthought which was established under pressure from the Opposition. It was given limited terms of reference with which to carry out a difficult task in a limited timeframe. It must be acknowledged that the commission has done an outstanding job in those circumstances. The Minister relies on the fact that the commission said it was reasonably happy with the voting machine hardware. The criticisms we made of the system had little or nothing to do with the hardware. Our criticisms mainly involved the software and its possible vulnerability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the count software.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The criticisms involved both the software of the machines and counting system software. The report published by the Labour Party last autumn was rubbished by the Minister because its authors were members of the party and declared themselves to be such. The Labour Party report identified the very issues referred to <Col N="1220"/>in section 4.5 of the commission&rsquo;s report. The authors of the Labour Party report made four or five particular recommendations, one of which was that there should be a full end-to-end test of the system. This is precisely the same as the commission&rsquo;s recommendation of an independent end-to-end test. The Labour Party report recommended that the introduction and operation of electronic voting should be the responsibility of an independent body. In essence, that is what is contained in the second, third and fourth bullet points of the commission&rsquo;s recommendation. I will return to these points when I respond to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite flabbergasted listening to the Minister. I thought he would come to the House and show a little flexibility towards the views of the Opposition. As I said earlier, I am quite flexible in dealing with some of the major issues. The Minister quoted selectively from the commission&rsquo;s report and I do not know what point he was making. The Minister accused me of looking through the wrong end of the telescope. My point is that the Minister is looking down the barrel of a gun in terms of his position. He was quite insulting when we raised the core issue of a verifiable paper audit trail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an issue as far as I am concerned. On page 23 of the commission&rsquo;s report, it is certainly an issue. The commission says that although they do not fall strictly within its terms of reference, the following observations have a bearing on the successful implementation of the system at elections in Ireland. According to the commission, the system cannot accommodate voters who wish to register an abstention and it does not have a voter-verifiable audit trail for voters. This trail is argued by many to reassure voters that their votes have been correctly recorded.</P>
      <P>The Minister is repeating his mistakes this evening. While the Government will maintain the commission, its terms of reference will remain narrow. I ask the Minister to show his hand and tell the House exactly how he thinks we can go forward in the quagmire he has got us into. I would say also that the absence of a verifiable audit trail significantly raises the standard of proof for a positive opinion. I and many others are concerned about the &euro;4.5 million wasted on this ludicrous programme and the Minister&rsquo;s statement that it is as simple as &ldquo;one, two, three&rdquo;. Nothing is as simple as that. Will the Minister inform the House how much of the &euro;4.5 million has been spent? Will he use the remainder to encourage people to register to vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not relevant to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1221"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and vote on 11 June? The problem of getting people out to vote is a core issue. Instead of throwing good money after bad, the Minister should ensure the remainder is used in positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s final question, less than half the amount remains with &euro;1 million of the total budget being set aside for use in encouraging people to vote. The Government will proceed with that aspect. I welcome Deputy Allen&rsquo;s support in that regard. We should try, if nothing else, to get people out to vote.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues contained in the report need to be carefully studied. I do not wish at this point, in the context of this debate, to go any further than I have. That may be for others to do. The commission raised two clear issues. It needs more time to repeat testing undertaken by international bodies. That is fair enough. It that is what it wishes to do, that is fine with me. It will be given the time to do the tests. It also states it has not had enough time to do the tests and the Government is willing to give it more time.</P>
      <P>The commission&rsquo;s criticism of the system almost exclusively concerns the counting software. It questions how it is broken into. I do not wish to be flippant but my understanding is that the concerns raised relate to the extreme circumstance of an unknown person walking into a count centre filled with candidates, party colleagues, returning officers and presiding officers, walk through all those people, take over a computer in full view of everybody, hack into the system with the approval of everyone standing by and, having achieved that magnificent feat, sunder the election results. I ask people for balance in this debate. The chance of that sort of scenario happening is, in my view, is of incredulous proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is trying to rubbish the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That said, it is possible; anything is possible. However, we need balance in this debate. The issues raised must be carefully studied and responded to if we are to understand them. My Department is unclear about what exactly is meant by a number of the issues in the commission&rsquo;s report. Obviously we are anxious to understand and correct the issues.</P>
      <P>Deputies have raised broader issues, many of which I have views on although I am not in a position to state them now. Having listened to Deputies, I am between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, people want the commission to complete its work and, on the other, they do not. It is clear that we need to provide the commission the space and time guaranteed to it. That is essential. I have no doubt that if I had come to the House having said I was withdrawing this Bill and abandoning it, I would have been savaged for preventing the commission completing its work.</P>

	<P>The Minister has two minutes remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The money invested in the system is capital money. The system has a 20 year life span. I have no doubt, as I am sure everyone believes, that we will meet the requirements and concerns raised. We will work with all concerned on the recommendations to ensure the system can and will be used in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a little like a person with no licence buying a car. He cannot drive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is probably the most sophisticated electronic voting system in the world although it may take people time to grapple with that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It cannot be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the commission did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It cannot be used in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission goes out of its way to make the opposite point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The system is not being used in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not alone does it state what I quoted earlier, it states that it fully accepts that the standard of proof to give a positive opinion would be far higher than the standard of proof required to give a negative one and so it has opted for the lower standard. That is fair enough. The commission needs more time to conclude its investigation of the system. I have no argument with that and never had. It does not, however, mean there is anything wrong with the system or that any of the tests undertaken by national or international bodies are not accurate. All the tests carried out by the commission came up 100% perfect.</P>
      <P>The question raised in terms of the count system and its security is a serious one but I would like to know exactly what the commission means in terms of accessing and how one would access the system. The best thing the D&aacute;il and Seanad can do, now that we have an independent commission in place, is to give it what it wants and allow it to continue its work. We should put it on the statutory footing requested by it and guaranteed by Government. I presume everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas wanted the commission to be placed on a statutory footing. We should now allow it the time and space to complete its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government give it a broader terms of reference?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1223"/>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem in that regard. Deputy Allen raised interesting questions, as did Deputy Gilmore. Now that this debate has moved on, I have similar views. There are issues coming down the tracks in terms of the conduct and administration of elections in this country. I am open to moving to a different system. I do not have a difficulty with that idea and am quite willing to engage in such a process. However, a shorter timeframe is involved. We owe it to the commission, having established it, to allow it to complete its work. That is a reasonable request. The Deputy raised other issues on which I have an open mind. I have no difficulty with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has exceeded his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody had two minutes in which to respond. I do not wish to challenge the Chair but it was my understanding that it was only the proposer of the amendment who had two minutes to speak. I am trying to respond to all Deputies who spoke on this matter.</P>
      <P>The issues raised are important. I wish to put on the record of the House that, in the broader context of where the future may lie, I have an open mind. In fact, I have more than an open mind. My views on this issue probably coincide with Deputies on all sides of the House. That was always my view, but I was charged with a specific responsibility under particular terms of reference into which, as Deputies will be aware, the commission had a direct input. The terms of reference it received were, as I understand it, those it requested.</P>
      <P>We should allow this report to be put to bed fairly and squarely in terms of the issues about which the commission has raised questions. However, the commission is quite clear that it has not produced findings at this stage. We are holding a debate as if on the basis of substantial findings, but there are no such findings as of yet. The commission is clear in pointing that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then is the system not being used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>At the time, I said, and the Taoiseach supported me, that if the commission did not give a clear and green light to the system, we would not pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission has clearly stated it needs more time to undertake testing. I do not take issue with that. I would have preferred if all the independent testing that had been done was alluded to in this report and given some credence. The bodies which undertook the international testing, all of which was made available, are substantive international bodies. There is no doubt in that regard. In allowing the commission <Col N="1224"/>to complete its testing, I would also like that testing to be taken on board.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that the Minister for Health and Children has not bothered to come to the House. He has no difficulty appearing on television and spinning yarns to the public, but he is not willing to come to the House to debate the issues which are within his remit and on which he has failed so abysmally.</P>
        <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This motion is tabled by the Labour Party with the sole purpose of ensuring that the thousands of patients who have been left on hospital waiting lists can finally get the treatment to which they are entitled and the justice they deserve. They have been subjected to the most cruel deception by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children who promised an end to the long wait and who promptly reneged on their word.</P>
        <P>The latest published figures show that 27,308 adults and children are waiting to access the health care they need and 20% of adult patients are waiting for more than a year. Many thousands more are on the hidden waiting list, waiting for an appointment to see a specialist so that they can then join those already on the hospital waiting lists. All these people know that if they could afford health insurance, they would not be forced to wait, but because they are public patients, they are stuck and the Government deliberately denies them the access to health care they need.</P>
        <P>In a panic response to this motion the Minister for Health and Children has released a statement to try to cover up the extent of his failure. The figures published at the end of September 2003 showed 27,212 people waiting. Those published today for the end of December 2003 show an increase to 27,318.</P>
        <P>In an attempt to disguise the extent of its failure the Government has handed responsibility for the issue to the national treatment purchase fund. It, in turn, has invented a new validation system which as far as one can gather &mdash; it is all very murky and unclear &mdash; is a comparison of the actual waiting list numbers and those presenting for national purchase treatment fund treatment. The shortfall of 4,500 is not explained in any coherent fashion. We do not know if patients who are described as not available for treatment are unavailable because they are too sick to avail of care, how many have died while waiting in vain <Col N="1226"/><?oasys _fc?>for treatment or how many have gone into debt to pay for private care. However, we know that those described as postponing treatment at their own request still, undoubtedly, need treatment and it is dishonest for anyone, including the Minister, to try to claim otherwise.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children again makes fraudulent claims when he says health strategy targets are being met. The target set in the health strategy was that, by the end of 2002, no adult would be waiting more than 12 months. We know from today&rsquo;s figures that 20% of patients, approximately 6,000, are still waiting more than 12 months and that others are waiting even longer. No massaging of the figures by the Minister can disguise that fact. Many of these people are elderly and infirm. They need and deserve the best health care the country can afford.</P>
        <P>Before the last general election, the Taoiseach promised that, come this week, no patient would be left on any hospital waiting list anywhere. The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto declared: &ldquo;Fianna F&aacute;il will permanently end waiting lists in our hospitals within two years through a combination of bed capacity, primary care, secondary care and targeted reform initiatives.&rdquo; This was a solemn undertaking made to the people. The Taoiseach said health would be the number one spending priority even if, in his own words, the economy falters. The public now knows the truth. It knows it was swindled by Fianna F&aacute;il and that the Taoiseach made an empty, dishonest, fraudulent promise. The Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, promised 200,000 new medical cards and 3,000 new beds. These commitments were also bogus. The Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, promised there would be no cutbacks. He said: &ldquo;No cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise.&rdquo; That promise turned out to be spurious also. Immediately after the election a Government memo outlining &euro;900 million in cutbacks was issued to the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has people to collude with it on its project of misleading the public. The Progressive Democrats Party has supported, every step of the way, what has been proposed at Cabinet. The Government turned its back on the illness and suffering of thousands of people waiting for health care and jettisoned its commitment. It raised medical charges, instituted a staff embargo and made savage cutbacks that targeted the most vulnerable. For 12 months before the general election of 2002, the money tap was turned on and public expenditure increased by 27%. Once the election was won, the tap was turned off and the splurge ended along with the hopes of thousands of hospital patients. So steeped in cynicism is the Government that it is now preparing for a second time to manipulate the health needs of sick people to win votes in the <Col N="1227"/><?oasys _fc?><?oasys _cl11.5-?>run-up to the local and European elections. It is again planning to turn on the money tap for electoral advantage.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is having this debate so that, this time, patients will not be made to suffer. We will not tolerate the brand of Fianna F&aacute;il trickery that had Ray Burke transporting trees into a newly built housing estate for the duration of a by-election in Dublin West. Once the votes were counted, the trees vanished. The Labour Party is determined to ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats do not pull the same stunt twice. This is why we have tabled this Private Members&rsquo; motion: to hold the Government to account and to ensure that those in need of health care can access the care they need through the locked doors of medical units that have been callously kept closed by the Government, and through the introduction of effective measures to deal with the crisis.</P>
        <P>This week, a confidential Government <i>aide-m&eacute;moire </i>was leaked to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>. It sets out the stark reality that health has never been a priority for the Government. In fact, the needs of patients have been cruelly and deliberately set aside. Despite the urgent need to expand capacity within the health service, the Government decided to spend the money elsewhere. It chose other priorities. According to the <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">Some &euro;400 million capital funding has been invested in a number of new health facilities that are ready for equipping, commissioning and opening. Many have been completed and have been waiting to open across a range of health care programmes. With the introduction of the existing level of service bases for conducting the Estimates process, funding was not provided for the opening of new units in either 2003 or 2004. If these units are not opened in 2004 the investment that has already been made in the units will not be properly utilised. It should be noted that there is an ongoing cost to the Exchequer in maintaining completed and vacant facilities by way of security, depreciation and other non-pay costs, for example, heating.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, it is deliberate Government policy that is keeping these new health facilities closed. Not only are patients paying the price for this policy, the taxpayers are also paying the cost of unnecessary security and maintenance in unopened facilities.</P>
        <P>Being in Government is about making choices. Instead of choosing to spend money to alleviate the suffering, pain and illness of those on hospital waiting lists, as it promised it would, the Government chose to spend the money elsewhere. They squandered an equivalent amount on an electronic voting system that was <Col N="1228"/>so unreliable it had to be abandoned. A ministerial ego trip became the priority instead of health. Here was a voting system that nobody wanted, nobody requested and ultimately nobody could stand over. This resulted in &euro;50 million being flushed down the drain by an irresponsible, arrogant Cabinet headed up by a man who promised to abolish hospital waiting lists within two years.</P>
        <P>We now know because officials from the Department of Health and Children have spelled it out in black and white that this &euro;50 million would have opened up a whole range of new medical facilities and that had this been done, a great amount of suffering and sickness would have been alleviated. For example, the Government could have opened new and expanded accident and emergency departments at Cork University Hospital, Naas General Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital. Instead these units continue to lie idle.</P>
        <P>In the meantime the crisis in the emergency services has deepened in the past two years. Hundreds and hundreds of patients have been laid on trolleys or sat on chairs in accident and emergency departments across the country. Patients have been treated on occasion in the car park of Beaumont Hospital. On 5 February 2004, in an unprecedented move, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was forced to invoke its major incident plan because clinicians were simply overwhelmed by the demand. In Wexford Hospital, the situation was described as chaotic.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nurses&rsquo; Organisation itemised the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, stating the number of patients waiting on trolleys and chairs on one day as follows: Tallaght Hospital, 42 patients; Naas Hospital, 37 patients; the Mater Hospital, 30 patients; Beaumont Hospital, 28 patients; St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, 28 patients; James Connolly Memorial Hospital, 23 patients; St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, 13 patients; St. Colmcille&rsquo;s Hospital, six patients &mdash; a total of 207 patients on trolleys and chairs. On the same day in Limerick Hospital, 33 patients were waiting on trolleys and chairs. In Cork University Hospital there were 18 people waiting and in the Mercy Hospital, Cork another 11 patients were waiting in this way. That is the true human cost of the failure of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
        <P>In December 2001, in the run up to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s solemn promise to the people, 26,126 were waiting for hospital treatment and in the most recent figure, it has risen to more than 27,000. Hospital units have been constructed and completed that would have eased this pressure but are being deliberately kept closed. According to a Government <i>aide-m&eacute;moire,</i> 220 new beds could have been added to the current bed numbers, as well as increased theatre capacity for <Col N="1229"/>example at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Limerick Regional Hospital, South Tipperary Hospital, Clonmel. There could have been increased capacity in intensive care, coronary care and high dependency units for example in Portiuncula, University College Hospital Galway, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and at Naas Hospital. We could have developed cancer services in Cork and Galway and opened new hospital buildings at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and Naas Hospital and we could have fully commissioned a new trauma and elective orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital. I have not mentioned Mullingar Hospital, because my colleague, Deputy Penrose will deal with it tomorrow, but it is probably the longest standing scandal.</P>
        <P>It is clear the Government had within its powers the capability to address the needs of critically ill patients and patients waiting for elective procedures. It could have done what it promised, introduced improved bed capacity, primary and secondary care and targeted reform initiatives. What did it do? The Cabinet spent &euro;50 million on e-voting machinery and &euro;15 million on an equestrian centre. It looked after the horses and machines, but forgot about people. The Government refused to spend the money on opening health care facilities as they came on stream. Let us be clear, all the Cabinet, including the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children bear responsibility for what has happened and what has not been done.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party raised the crisis in our health service on many occasions in the House. Our view is expressed in the motion before the House and is vindicated by the contents of the leaked departmental memo which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The challenges currently facing the acute hospital system include shortage of beds, unacceptably long waiting times, long delays in A &amp;  E departments, frequent cancellations of elective admissions, inappropriate occupancy of acute hospital beds, unacceptably high bed occupancy levels.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One issue that we would have added to the list is the unequal treatment between public and private patients. It skews the treatment that people can access when they need it. Treatment is not delivered on the basis of need, but on the basis of income.</P>
        <P>Belatedly I welcome the Minister for Health and Children. I know Deputy Martin has had a busy schedule, spinning yarns to the public, but people will not be fooled by the gloss he is able to put on the bad figures.</P>
        <P>The <i>aide-m&eacute;moire </i>prepared by Government officials is substantially the same as the Labour Party has articulated and repeated in the motion <Col N="1230"/>before the House tonight as being the outline of the underlying problems in the acute hospital services, in particular. This is in direct contrast to the smug assurances given many times in this House by both the Minister for Health and Children the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the state of the health service. Not only does the memo spell out the real and parlous state of the health service, it reveals the mendacity of a Government that deliberately prevented people gaining access to the new facilities that have been constructed under the National Development Plan but have been kept closed under the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Government. The memo states that &euro;400 million worth of facilities are lying idle across the country and if they were opened they &ldquo;would have an immediate impact on relieving pressure on services such as acute hospitals, services for older people, mental health services, services for persons with intellectual disability or autism and adult homelessness&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We are calling on the Government to open these units immediately, not because there is an election in the offing but because patients needs access to health care and they have been denied this access for too long. We are also seeking in the motion that all hospital beds currently closed or under threat of closure be re-opened. Earlier this year, the Eastern Regional Health Authority promised to open 196 acute and non-acute beds. Will the Minister for Health and Children tell us how many have been opened and the current number of closed beds across the country? In recent days I have received a complaint that approximately 30 to 40 beds will be closed in Tralee Hospital for a number of months for &ldquo;budgetary reasons&rdquo;. How can the Minister stand over such closures?</P>
        <P>It is bizarre and perverse that on the one hand, Government policy is supposed to be committed to providing new beds, while at the same time hospital beds are closed to save on running costs. In the latest figures, it is estimated that 50,000 bed-days were lost in the first six months of 2003. When money was allocated to re-open beds to deal with this problem particularly in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, another aspect of bed closures, the lack of nursing staff, suddenly became the issue. According to the national survey on nursing resources, published by the health services employers agency in February 2004, there are still 675 nursing vacancies. In one case alone, there are 59 vacant posts in Beaumont Hospital, one of the largest and busiest hospitals in the country where the total number of nurses fell in 2003. In all acute hospitals that have waiting lists, a full nursing complement must be guaranteed and it is up to the Government to introduce the necessary measures to meet that target. The dedication and the hard work of the existing nursing staff cannot be relied upon <Col N="1231"/>indefinitely to prop up a failing system. There will be no nursing graduates next year due to the introduction of a new nursing degree programme. Surely that prospect is sufficient to focus the Government on the gravity of the situation.</P>
        <P>There is a need to tackle the blocking of acute beds by patients who could and should be in rehabilitation beds. Again, the Government promised much but did not deliver. The PPP nursing units never materialised. There are hundreds of private nursing home beds vacant, yet waiting lists for rehabilitation places and budgetary pressures determine an inappropriate use of acute beds in our hospitals.</P>
        <P>The motion seeks that a real emphasis be put on community and primary care. Regrettably, the record shows that, far from supporting a policy shift towards primary care, all we have got from the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is greater inequality and unfairness at that level of care. Today only 27.7% of people have medical cards on income grounds. This is the lowest level since the GMS card was introduced in 1972. This country has become wealthy in the meantime, yet we cannot ensure that people on modest and low incomes are protected in the way they were in 1972. In 1977, almost 39% of the population was covered by the GMS scheme. The income limits rise with the consumer price index but not with wages or social welfare rates. Fewer and fewer low paid workers have medical cards, yet medical costs are increasing much faster than the CPI. GPs&rsquo; charges have increased and most of the increases are the direct responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. He increased costs in the drugs refund scheme, accident and emergency charges and in-patient hospital care.</P>
        <P>One family doctor said at the recent IMO conference that they have all seen people putting their own lives and the lives of their family and children at risk because they cannot afford to see a doctor. What kind of legacy is that? What Minister for Health and Children can stand over a situation where people cannot access their family doctor because of the cost of doing so? No other European country would tolerate this situation, yet the Minister can blithely continue on as if a promise to provide medical cards is something which simply exists to be broken. The Minister for Health and Children promised 200,000 new medical cards prior to the last general election. Since then the number of medical cards has decreased. There are 100,000 fewer medical cards in the system than previously. It is a scandal that low income families, living in one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, cannot afford to bring their children to the doctor.</P>
        <P>Another IMO member said, in reference to the debacle regarding the over 70&rsquo;s deal which the Minister bungled following the budget <Col N="1232"/>announcement by the Minister for Finance, that people with less need were prioritised over people with more need for purely cynical political reasons.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that when the Minister for Health and Children responds he will go through his usual rigmarole, explaining how more money is being put into the system and everything is hunky-dory. No doubt he will refer to his primary care strategy, but he will not tell us the fully story. He will not admit that seven of the ten primary care projects are bogged down, funding has dried to a trickle and the entire process appears to be going nowhere.</P>
        <P>We have had, and continue to have, a Minister for Health and Children who has not dealt with the real issues in the health service, real issues that impact on patients. The record is clear. Thousands are still waiting for hospital care. There are fewer medical cards and greater injustice at primary care level. New hospital wards and operating theatres are locked and existing beds are closed. When a need has gained his attention, the Minister&rsquo;s response has been to commission yet another report. Approximately 147 reports, commissions and task forces have come out of his Department since 1997. I heard today that the Government is producing &euro;1 million worth of reports each week. It would be interesting to know if that is true because I have it on good authority.</P>
        <P>I suspect that the Minister is blinded by the flow of expert advice he had unleashed. He no longer sees the needs of patients. Today he is confronted by an increasing number of patients on hospital waiting lists and his response has been to manipulate the figures and make false claims. It is as if nothing has changed. The only difference is that in the meantime the plans have become more grandiose, more ambitious and more out of touch with what people who are trying to access health care need. This is evident in his whole approach to local hospitals and his policy of closing accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>Concerns are now being raised about the Minister&rsquo;s approach by health professionals, people working in the health service who have knowledge that none of us here have. They are increasingly worried about his neglect of the nuts and bolts which are now slipping off the programme, particularly proposed legislation. The Government can no longer give a timeframe for such vital and basic legislation as the medical practitioners Bill or the nurses Bill. All this has been put aside while the Minister concentrates on his major health reform project.</P>
        <P>He has no answer to the serious concerns being raised by health professionals about the working time directive to be implemented on 1 August. The Minister has made it clear that he will not seek a derogation of the working time directive, <Col N="1233"/>and the deadline will be met. He has made it clear that he will not appoint new junior hospital doctors. He has also made it clear that no extra consultants will be in place on this date. The question that has been asked by people working within the service, including doctors, nurses and managers, is how will this be done. The obvious way the directive requirements will be met is by reducing out-patient clinics and operating theatre hours, which means reducing patient care.</P>
        <P>Too often patients have to pay the price for failure of Government policy. It appears that we are again facing patient suffering and patient pain being prolonged unnecessarily because the Minister for Health and Children is unable to meet the basic needs to put in place the patient-friendly and efficient measures sought in the motion before us tonight. The motion seeks to ensure that the crises in accident and emergency departments are tackled, that bed blocking is reduced significantly, new beds are put in place, existing beds are maintained and that people, including children, who get sick know they can see their family doctor and no longer put theirs or their children&rsquo;s lives at risk because the Government has failed to deliver on a promise made to the Irish people.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is continuing to spin as best he can, even though he is running out of credibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion deplores the failure of the Government to honour the commitments it made and the cynicism it displayed in making promises it clearly had no intention of honouring. The Government amendment refers to the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, but the Minister for Health and Children knows nothing about quality or fairness. As was stated earlier, the Labour Party opposes the Hanly report which proposes to change the role of general hospitals to implement the European working time directive which requires that junior doctors work fewer hours.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that 90% of people treated in hospitals in this country can be treated in the general hospital system without recourse to larger hospitals. The Minister proposes to change the role of our general hospitals, but it will not be easy for him. Mallow General Hospital provides acute medical and surgical facilities, including ear, nose and throat surgery. There is also a 24 hour accident and emergency service with an ambulance base and out-patient and physiotherapy services as well as a laboratory and other ancillary services.</P><Col N="1234"/>
        <P>We must not forget the human cost if this report is implemented because it will make it difficult for people living in the areas west and north of Mallow to visit relatives and friends if services are moved to Cork. This applies particularly to older people. There is a distinct advantage to patients when they are healing if their families are in close proximity to the hospital. That is what is described as a sociological argument although I do not know whether the Minister knows anything about it.</P>
        <P>Consultants, general practitioners, nurses and the general public have opposed the Hanly proposals. If they were implemented nationally, the current network of 38 general hospitals would be reduced to 12 providing services 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The centralisation of acute care would mean that many patients would have to travel much longer distances than at present to get to hospital. The Hanly report proposes a paramedic ambulance service to cope with this problem. However, that is not acceptable because we have plenty of experience of delays in ambulance services.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Minister many times to provide for radiologists, geriatricians and a CT scanner in Mallow. This has been ongoing since 2001. I am well aware that the chairman of Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al is a consultant at Cork University Hospital and is a member of the Hanly group. Therefore he knows what is required. However, the body has begun to downgrade the hospital by stealth. He knew what was envisaged by the Hanly report and, consequently, no appointments have been made of a radiologist or obstetrician and no provision has been made for a CT scanner.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister&rsquo;s officials will listen to my next point. I received information from the Department of Health and Children that it costs &euro;746 per day to treat a patient at Cork University Hospital, while at Mallow General Hospital the rate is a comparatively cheaper &euro;475. How can one justify that with 90% of people being treated in our general hospital at half the rate? The north Cork region has a population of more than 90,000 but no extra beds are being provided in this region, especially in community hospitals, to cater for the elderly. Families have been given subvention claim forms and are being encouraged to apply for beds in private nursing homes. Subventions are not being paid which is resulting in major financial difficulties for families.</P>
        <P>In a recent reply, the Minister informed me he had provided &euro;21.4 million to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to more appropriate settings, thereby freeing up acute beds. I will outline a number of cases which have occurred in the past week. A lady referred from the north Cork area who was a carer for her husband was told it would take until the end of 2005 before she would be seen for a <Col N="1235"/>gynaecological treatment in Cork University Hospital. We should think about that.</P>
        <P>A lady from the Fermoy area whose son was caring for her had an operation in Cork University Hospital. The son was informed he had no choice other than to fill in a claim for subvention. He had no idea what that meant because they had nothing but her pension and a carer&rsquo;s allowance. He was told there were no beds and his only choice was to complete that form. An elderly lady of 78 years in the Fermoy area who was being cared for by her daughter was referred to Dromcollogher in County Limerick, far from her own people. Her respite care had ended there and she has now gone to Tipperary because the Alzheimer Society has provided for her there. More than 500 people are waiting for enhanced subvention in the Cork area and it is always stated that the Minister is not providing the money. The Minister is not closing hospitals but he is downgrading them to be half-way houses for half-cured patients.</P>
        <P>In regard to the issue of medical cards referred to by Deputy McManus, an elderly lady recently cried when she went to a chemist and had to pay for what was prescribed for her family from money she could not afford because their income was marginally over the limit. A doctor&rsquo;s letter was submitted with her application but it was rejected. Standing beside this woman was one of the wealthiest people in the area who presented a medical card. The Minister should think about that because it is what he is presiding over. The person in question could not afford the medicine but the elderly wealthy person produced a medical card which is outrageous. I am glad Deputy McManus referred to this issue about which the IMO at national level has also spoken out. General practitioners are annoyed that their letters of recommendation are being ignored by health board officials.</P>
        <P>This motion should not be opposed by the Government but rather taken seriously and implemented. If the Minister thinks he will implement the Hanly report in our region, he has another think coming.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Tonight&rsquo;s debate allows me to report on the significant progress that has been achieved on hospital waiting lists. I remind Deputies that waiting lists stood at 23,000 in December 1994 when Labour and Fine Gael assumed control of the health services. In their programmes for Government they spelt out clearly, &ldquo;We will continue the progress of the past two years in reducing waiting lists.&rdquo; Despite their pledge the waiting lists rose by 27% under the rainbow coalition, from around 23,000 in December 1994 to around 30,000 in June 1997. That was the record of the caring coalition. What was the reaction of the rainbow democratic alternative to this state of affairs? In January 1997, in the face of a 27% rise in waiting lists, they cut the funding on the reduction of waiting lists by 20%.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s programme &mdash; from which the Labour Party could learn much &mdash; is founded on two key concerns: first, to invest in services and, second, to bring about significant reform. In <Col N="1237"/>terms of investment we have made considerable progress since the Labour Party was last in Government. There can be no arguing that this year the Government will invest almost &euro;10.2 billion in health in comparison to a paltry £2.5 billion donated by the rainbow Administration when it was in office.</P>

        <P>As for the Labour Party&rsquo;s criticism of our reform record, we have set out not just a challenging programme of reform of which the Hanly task force report is just one vital element, we are now set forth on implementing the most comprehensive reform programme in the recent history of Irish health care. As Deputy McManus is well aware, earlier this year the Government announced decisions regarding a new health services executive which will include a national hospital office, a primary and continuing care directorate and a shared services centre. Taken together, these structural reforms represent the biggest single national reorganisation of the health system since 1970.</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt speakers. We are in a House where the principle of free speech should be honoured and I would appreciate the opportunity to complete my speech.</P>
        <P>It is important to put the provision of acute hospital services in context. Over the last two or three decades there have been numerous important advances in surgical technology and in anaesthesia. These advances have greatly improved the range, the safety and the effectiveness of the surgical procedures that can be offered by modern health systems. However, as a consequence there have been dramatic increases in the demand for surgical procedures, especially elective procedures. Day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care in Ireland. Evidence shows that much of the growth is the result of technological and medical innovations, such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics. There has been a staggering increase of nearly 80%, from 249,472 to 440,817, between 1997 and 2003. This increase reflects the increasing ability of the hospital system to treat more patients on a day basis where they are admitted and discharged on the same day. The funding has gone to that 80% increase, but that is rarely acknowledged in the House.</P>
        <P>The nature of any health care system is such that not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately. Acute services have to be provided in a way that uses hospital facilities to best effect. Patients who require elective treatment may have to wait because beds, staff and operating theatres are being used to treat emergency cases. The balance to be achieved is to ensure that the available resources are used efficiently and that treatment can be delivered to patients in a reasonable time.</P>
        <P>From the beginning this Government wanted to focus clearly on reducing waiting times for public patients who required admission to hospital for elective treatment. In order to keep the focus on waiting times we set ourselves ambitious targets both in the health strategy and in the programme for Government. I make no apologies for the setting of these targets, as without targets we would have nothing to aim for. Those targets have allowed the Government to maintain a particular focus on those waiting longest for hospital treatment.</P><Col N="1239"/>
        <P>I was very pleased earlier today to announce significant progress in relation to identifying the true position of elective waiting lists in this country. This significant progress has in particular been achieved through the work of the national treatment purchase fund. The NTPF is a health strategy initiative with the task of achieving reductions in waiting times and particularly to offer treatment to those who have been waiting longest. I will set out for the benefit of the House some of the information reported by the NTPF today. The NTPF has reported that waiting times have fallen significantly in the last year, with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. Therefore 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has a multidisciplinary team which has been working with individual hospitals to identify patients on waiting lists for surgical procedures. The NTPF has undertaken validation of those waiting longest for treatment and this suggests that the figures reported to the Department of Health and Children overstate the number of persons who are available for treatment. The Department, in consultation with the NTPF, has carried out a comparative analysis of the number of patients reported to be waiting for surgical treatments and it has become clear that the number of patients reported to the Department includes patients who are not actually waiting or available for treatment.</P>
        <P>Having set up the NTPF on a statutory basis with effect for 15 May 2004 I have also decided to transfer responsibility for the recording and publishing of waiting list figures to the NTPF. The NTPF, in conjunction with the Department and health agencies, has undertaken a verification process which takes account of the constant movement of patients on and off lists &mdash; &ldquo;the flow factor&rdquo;. The NTPF has taken account of such factors as patients not being available for treatment, patients not being medically suitable to undergo treatment, patients no longer requiring treatment and patients postponing treatment at their own request.</P>
        <P>When those factors have been taken into account the NTPF has estimated that a large number of patients, approximately 4,500, can be removed from the Department&rsquo;s reported figure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on its detailed interaction with individual hospitals the NTPF has identified a group of 19,591 patients who are reported to be waiting more than three months for specific procedures, mainly surgical, and the NTPF will target this group during 2004. There are 4,040 patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment included in the 19,591, who represent 20% of all those waiting. A certain percentage of the identified group of patients is expected to be removed through further validation. This is done by going to the patient and asking them if they want an operation, as that organisation can provide it. That is how those figures are assessed by the NTPF. It is a different methodology and a different approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister not mention that before?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been done by me or by officials in the Department but a multidisciplinary team with medical and nursing inputs. That is how this is happening. Those are <Col N="1241"/>objective facts. By arranging an estimated 12,000 treatments in 2004, the national treatment purchase fund will make further significant progress in reducing the average waiting times for surgical procedures.</P>
        <P>In 2004 I have allocated &euro;31 million to the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority as base funding for consultant and other support staff costs associated with reducing elective waiting lists. I have also increased the funding for the national treatment purchase fund to &euro;44 million in 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>More spin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, the total amount of dedicated funding available to tackle waiting lists in 2004 &mdash; &euro;75 million &mdash; is the same level of funding provided in 2003, despite the spin and misleading comments of Deputy McManus at the joint committee last week. However, the national treatment purchase fund now has the significant lead role in tackling waiting times and waiting lists. Opposition Deputies appear to find it difficult to accept the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>We are speaking facts but the Minister is not doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Waiting times for surgical treatment have been reduced. In the specialty of cardiac surgery alone adult waiting lists have fallen by 90%, from 1,477 to 150, and children&rsquo;s waiting lists have fallen by 91% since 1997, from 109 to 10. One will never hear that from the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Green Party or Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We hear it from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a dramatic improvement because of increased surgical provision, new units in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, in particular, on the adult side and in the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the unit in Clonmel that the Minister is not opening?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The national treatment purchase fund has substantial capacity to treat patients and will continue to focus on reducing waiting times even further. The fund&rsquo;s target is to treat more than 12,000 this year and has the capacity to treat a minimum of 1,000 patients per month &mdash; 800 in Ireland and 200 in four private hospitals in England. Maintaining referrals at this level will result in waiting times for surgical operations being reduced in line with the health strategy targets of three to six months. Almost half of all hospitals now refer patients waiting between six and 12 months. Nine hospitals &mdash; 38% &mdash; refer patient waiting three to six months, 11 hospitals <Col N="1242"/>&mdash; 46% &mdash; refer patients waiting six to 12 months, and four hospitals &mdash; 16% &mdash; refer patients waiting 12 to 24 months.</P>
        <P>Much progress has been made to reduce waiting times and we are on track to achieve the targets set out in the health strategy. The transfer of responsibility for waiting list figures to the national treatment purchase fund will result in a more accurate and complete picture of the numbers waiting and, more importantly, the length of time they wait for their procedures. The important issue is that patients wait for treatment for the shortest possible time and that the lists tell us correctly how many patients are available for treatment.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that treatment can be fast-tracked for patients who are willing to travel outside their local hospital or health board area. The fund has capacity available to treat more patients. Since the fund commenced arranging operations for patients, some 13,000 patients have been treated. It is also important to note that in a recent survey of patients who had their treatment arranged by the national treatment purchase fund, some 98.5% of patients treated were either satisfied or very satisfied with their treatment. Surely the level of satisfaction in that survey is testament to the significant progress being made by the national treatment purchase fund. Can we have some acknowledgement from the Opposition on that achievement? A clear message is being delivered here. There is no need for the majority of patients to wait more than six months for elective surgery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Now it is the patients&rsquo; fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Nearly 40% of acute hospitals will now refer patients who have been waiting more than three months to the national treatment purchase fund. Patients who have been waiting more than six months for treatment can contact the national treatment purchase fund directly or through their general practitioners to arrange treatment. We appeal to people to do that.</P>
        <P>While the national treatment purchase fund has the task of dealing with the immediate needs of patients, the increasing capacity of the public hospital system to treat an increasing number of patients is a product of the significant investment by the Government in health services. This year we have provided a gross allocation of &euro;10 billion for the health service which is almost double the level of funding in 1997.</P>
        <P>No one can deny that the hospital system is providing more and better services than ever before. Activity in our acute hospitals continues to rise. The reported number of patients on hospital waiting lists must be seen in the context of a continuing increase in the number of people treated in public hospitals. The number of patients discharged from hospital having been <Col N="1243"/>treated as either an in-patient or as a day case in 2003 was more than one million. This is the first time the number has exceeded one million and represents a 4.7% increase over 2002. This also represents a 27% increase in the number of patients treated compared with the number in 1997, which was approximately 785,000. The money is being spent on increased activity, procedures and treatments and more people being treated in the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the massage of the figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>These figures were objectively obtained. I do not have control over their compilation. Everybody knows about the system which is producing those activity figures in respect of who is being discharged from hospital. The system is independent from me and has been independent of different Ministers. That is well known. It is the bottom line. It might be hard to accept that but that is the reason there is such pressure on our acute hospitals. I pay tribute to our acute hospitals and staff who have dealt effectively with the expanding numbers due to the increased population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the response of the <i>aide-m&eacute;moire </i>or the other way round?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the elderly patients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The single most important factor for patients who await admission to hospital is bed availability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the elderly patients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The extent of the shortfall in acute capacity has been identified by a report entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review, and it indicated a requirement for an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospitals by 2011. I introduced the first phase of this process in January 2002 which provided funding in excess of &euro;117 million, capital and revenue, for an additional 709 acute beds for public patients. That money was put into and invested in the system. That represents an increase of 6% on existing capacity and some 584 of these beds have been commissioned to date.</P>
        <P>These additional services are now being provided by an increasing number of medical consultants. According to the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on consultant staffing on 1 January 2004, there were 1,824 consultant posts in the public sector in Ireland. This represents an increase of 41% in the last six years. No other period in the history of the State can equate that rise in consultant staffing levels and numbers. These are facts and they are resulting in increased <Col N="1244"/>activity. On the issue of nursing, a matter raised by Deputy McManus, there are repeated claims that there is a nursing crisis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there no crisis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but little acknowledgement that 8,200 more nurses work in the system than in 1997 while the annual number of nurse training places has also increased by 67%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is there more frustration in the nursing profession than ever before?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1994, when Labour and Fine Gael assumed responsibility for the reform of the health services, there were 1,179 pre-registration nurse training places in Ireland. The issue of medical manpower was already a pressing issue, and nurse shortages were becoming a serious issue. In its programme for Government, the rainbow Government spelt out: &ldquo;It is now a matter of urgency that the issue of medical staffing is addressed.&rdquo; Rather than heed its pledge, the coalition of the callous then cut back nurse training places. When it left office in 1997 the number of pre-registration nurse training places had declined to 982.</P>
        <P>To be fair to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who could have funded additional places, he made the astounding admission in the House before the previous general election that, as Minister for Finance, he was warned about impending nurse shortages and said: &ldquo;I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are, in part, related to that.&rdquo; This is despite the fact that he had pledged to address these shortages in the Labour-Fine Gael programme for Government. Deputies opposite should remember that when they talk about broken promises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Memories on the Government side are short.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They have some neck. Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments reflect system-wide issues. To deal with the current pressures on acute services both in the shorter term and in the longer term I shall outline briefly some of the key actions that I have taken. It has been widely documented that there are a number of patients in acute hospital beds who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The availability of suitable sub-acute beds is a particular problem in the eastern and southern regions. In this regard I have allocated &euro;12.6 million to the respective health boards to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting, thus <Col N="1245"/>freeing up acute beds. This funding allows for the funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community.</P>
        <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority some 250 patients have been discharged from acute hospitals as a direct result of this recent initiative. I am also pleased to note that the Eastern Regional Health Authority is reporting that it has been successful in agreeing the re-opening of the vast majority of acute beds in the eastern region which were temporarily closed.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>How many beds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>What about the ones that were never opened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the winter initiative package in 2000-2001, I provided additional funding of some &euro;40 million aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients. Part of this investment package was aimed at the recruitment of additional emergency medicine consultants and consultant anaesthetists. To date, 20 additional emergency medicine consultants have been recruited. Further appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA. There are now 51 emergency medicine consultant posts in acute hospitals, which is a 260% increase in numbers since 1997 when there were 14 consultants posts. I have had enough lectures about emergency medicine and accident and emergency cover.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the radiologists for Mallow?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1997 when this Government came into power there were 14 consultant posts and there are now 51. I will deal with Mallow hospital later. The Deputy need have no worries in that regard. The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition has done far more for Mallow hospital than the Deputy or his party ever did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should go to the hospital and tell them that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision-making, enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.</P>
        <P>With regard to primary care, emergency medicine departments sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions which are more <Col N="1246"/>appropriate to a primary care setting. Government support for the development of general practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives on a national basis for the period 1997 to 2003 amounted to &euro;46.5 million. In time, these co-ops can be developed to provide a much wider range of services to ensure that communities, irrespective of size and distance from major urban centres, enjoy appropriate access to primary care services. That has been a significant achievement in a very short period of time and it has been a very significant investment. The Government is well on the road to completing that over the next two years.</P>
        <P>I have demonstrated to the House this evening that this Government has achieved significant reductions in waiting times, particularly for those waiting longest for admission to hospital for treatment; it has made significant progress in meeting the health strategy target of no patient waiting more than three months for elective treatment; it continues to keep the focus on waiting times for public patients through the operation of the national treatment purchase fund; it has been instrumental in providing the necessary investment that has resulted in unprecedented levels of acute hospital activity; it continues to ensure that patient access to appropriate care and treatment remains at the centre of health policy.</P>
        <P>The Opposition&rsquo;s approach is to promise everything but never to provide a framework within which anything can be achieved. Much hypocrisy which has been heard tonight &mdash; for example, the criticism of the over-70s deal, despite the fact that the Deputies opposite welcomed it and voted for it in the lobbies of this House.</P>

	<P>Where is the consistency in approach?

        <P>This Government is planning the most ambitious programme of change in the health service for over 30 years. The key elements of that programme will be a significant rationalisation of existing health services agencies; the establishment of a health service executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity; the establishment of a health information and quality authority; the re-organisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight; the modernisation of the system-supporting processes; the strengthening of governance and accountability across the system.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is speaking now when I am endeavouring to speak. This Government has done more than any other Government in the history of the State to reduce hospital waiting lists. It has the courage to attempt to reform the health services, unlike <Col N="1249"/>other coalitions who knew about the problems in the health service and did not have the guts to take on the vested interests and change the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the leader of one coalition who did not realise it was so bad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much guff from the Opposition. They are very successful at being loud. They have one problem which constantly manifests itself right around the country: many people working in the health service are becoming tired of the constant moaning and complaining about the alleged problems in the health service. This Government is aware of the problems. It is starting in a courageous manner to reform the health service.</P>
        <P>The health boards have been in existence for 30 years. They have achieved much in their time but change is required. The Government is well aware that there are problems in the health services. It has initiated significant changes and will have the courage of its convictions to implement those changes.</P>
        <P>The waiting list initiative and the treatment purchase fund have been set up by the Government. The proof of the pudding is that there are now 13,000 patients, all medical card holders, who have been treated in an effective manner. The Minister referred in his contribution to the satisfaction rating of the patients at 98%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the other 2%?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the patients talking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the ones who have been treated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy begrudge it to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will continue and hopefully another 13,000 patients will be treated under the national treatment purchase fund this year. Eighty per cent of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. The figures for 2004 show that 20% of patients wait over 12 months and 2.5% wait over 24 months. This is very positive news for patients in that those who have been waiting longest have now been either treated under the national treatment purchase fund or have been offered treatment. The fund&rsquo;s target is to treat more than 12,000 patients this year and it has the capacity to treat a minimum of 1,000 patients per month.</P>
        <P>This Government is proud of its unprecedented initiatives on reforming the health services. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, on the <Col N="1250"/>initiatives he has taken on behalf of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is pathetic of the Minister to try to blame the Opposition for the problems in the health service, given that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has been in Government for 15 of the past 17 years and 20 of the past 27 years. If blame has to be apportioned for problems in the service, all of it lies at the door of the Government. Its attempt to blame the Opposition parties reflects the poverty of its excuses.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, in the run-up to a general election, the Minister promised to eliminate waiting lists. This week, in the run-up to another election, we have heard a further promise to miraculously make available money, staff and resources to open new facilities. Suddenly, this money which has long been absent has become available. This time, however, the public will not believe it. Having been forewarned by promises made at the previous election, they will view this one with jaundiced eyes and require concrete evidence before believing the emperor has new clothes.</P>
        <P>That promise was made yesterday. Today, presumably in response to this motion on the Government&rsquo;s failure to eliminate waiting lists by the deadline of this week, the Minister started to spin again. The figure for people on waiting lists, which stood at 27,000 this morning, miraculously declined by 4,500 by lunchtime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good progress in half a day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the second time the Minister has tried to manipulate the manner in which waiting lists are presented in order to confuse and confound everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the figures are not mine but were produced by another body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are never the Minister&rsquo;s figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The charge of manipulation is unfair and unjust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of who draws up the lists, how they are manipulated and what spin is put on them, the fact remains that even using a new accounting method discovered just in time for today&rsquo;s debate, a staggering 22,500 people still await treatment. The Minister&rsquo;s boast is that the figure has been reduced to 22,500 after two years, despite the large amount of money at his disposal. What happened to the 4,500 people in question between this morning and lunchtime? According to the Minister&rsquo;s statement, they were either not available for treatment, not medically suitable for treatment, no longer in need of treatment or <Col N="1251"/>requested postponing treatment. How do we explain this? The answer is that they either emigrated in despair, were too sick to be treated, died, or moved into the private system. The reality is that nobody recovered miraculously or if someone did, the Minister should start selling relics.</P>
        <P>This motion is not only about political point scoring and another broken promise but the price people pay for the Minister&rsquo;s broken promises. Sick and disabled people, the elderly and those in pain pay the price in pain, suffering, lost mobility, lost jobs and lost lives. Chronic waiting lists are not just another problem in the health service but the manifestation of the accumulation of many problems in the health service which have remained unresolved. They are the bottleneck into which indecision, shortages, inadequacies and inefficiencies have fed. Consequently, as the motion states, ending waiting lists is not solely a matter of bed capacity but of staffing and equipping beds and a range of other measures.</P>
        <P>Let us examine the Government&rsquo;s record on bed capacity. It has known for years from numerous reports that there are not enough beds in the system and the Minister has accepted that. Not since the time of the MacSharry cutbacks of the 1980s and even before that has the problem been so acute. Even the Hanly report accepted the need for an additional 3,000 beds as recommended in the health strategy. Despite giving a commitment to provide this number of beds over ten years, as with so many other promises, the Government&rsquo;s undertaking appears to have run into the ground.</P>
        <P>What is most disturbing is the absence of preparation to deal with the problem, not only in terms of developing physical infrastructure but as regards staffing &mdash; consultants, nurses or the many specialist health care professionals required. Where will the professionals be found to provide the beds the Government continues to promise on foot of the Hanly report? The problem is not only one of money but that the staff required have not been recruited not to mention trained.</P>
        <P>We cannot even retain those whom we train. Endless warnings have been made about the need to match the number of those in training with service needs. Like so many other well signalled disasters, however, these warnings have been ignored. It was precisely this lack of foresight in health and other sectors that killed the Celtic tiger. In other words, demand outstripped the supply of skilled manpower, which fed into higher labour costs and prices and, ultimately, resulted in a loss of competitiveness. The Government has learned nothing from that, yet it expects us to slavishly believe the promise in the Hanly report that we will have hordes of consultants touring networks of hospitals to treat people at will. <Col N="1252"/>Increasingly, such fanciful promises sound like the ravings of someone less and less in touch with reality. Perhaps the Minister is very much in touch with reality and the Hanly report and all the other reforms are nothing more than an effort to distract attention from the crisis now pervading virtually every sector and layer of the health service.</P>
        <P>Growing hospital lists and trolley clogged accident and emergency departments are all part of the same problem. They are two sides of the same coin which are widely reported, visible, quantifiable and shocking. Other waiting lists, however, are not reported in the media and while they may not be as visible or quantifiable, they are just as shocking. We do not hear of the children who will never be able to communicate because they were unable to get speech therapy at the crucial time of their lives, or of those who become permanently disabled or lose mobility because of a lack of physiotherapy.</P>
        <P>The real scandal, the real hidden waiting list, is the one that causes the greatest distress and suffering and results in the highest morbidity and mortality. It is the list of those waiting to see a consultant in the first instance, a group of people without even a diagnosis, much less a treatment, who sit on referral lists for endless months and about whom we never hear.</P>
        <P>If we had a sufficient number of consultants, this would not happen. If we did not have the ludicrous position in which virtually the only way to become a consultant is through Government appointment, perhaps it would not happen. If, instead of rationing access to care for patients, consultants were competing for business, perhaps it would not happen. If that idea is too revolutionary, we should at least have some transparency about waiting lists. Why are the public and general practitioners unable to find out which consultants have long and which have short waiting lists? This would enable them to at least make choices. Surely, in this age of consumer information, this is not too much to ask.</P>
        <P>If we had more consultants, there is no doubt that demand for expensive, acute beds would be reduced, people would see their consultants before their conditions deteriorated and consultants would have more time to organise tests outside acute hospitals without feeling the need to admit patients and cluster them as a time saving exercise.</P>
        <P>We were also promised improved and enhanced primary care as a means of reducing waiting lists. A strategy outlined a brave new world of primary care in which demand for hospital admission would be reduced through targeted intervention, early detection and ongoing illness management but virtually nothing happened. Even this year, primary care is the only area in which Government expenditure is <Col N="1253"/>falling as fewer and fewer families can afford to attend their general practitioners. More families must now make a choice as regards which members can attend a GP. They must prioritise between the breadwinner and the sickest, oldest and youngest family members and decide which of them will get part of the family&rsquo;s limited budget to pay for a visit to their general practitioner.</P>
        <P>These are the kind of devastating choices families have to make as a result of this Government&rsquo;s broken promises. There are families who are on waiting lists to see a consultant for a worrying and maybe painful condition, families who have loved ones awaiting admission for elective surgery, and families whose elderly parents lie for several days on trolleys. All these families place their trust in the Minister and the Government. No matter how the Minister spins it, and he is good at doing that, they know he has failed them. He will pay the price for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the second anniversary of the Government&rsquo;s promise to eliminate waiting lists. That is a fact no matter what the Minister states. It raised hopes for many people that their loved ones would receive treatment, but these hopes have been dashed. Waiting lists were to be ended this week. Instead, there are 23,000 to 27,000 on the waiting list, depending on when the Minister speaks. How many patients are waiting to see a consultant to get on a waiting list? How many young children and young adults are on orthodontic waiting lists? Waiting time in the Western Health Board area is now four years, yet only a minority of those seen can get on the orthodontic waiting list. It was two years only a few years ago. After deceiving the people at the previous general election by promising to eliminate the waiting list, there are now 23,000 to 27,000 people on that list. All the Department and the Minister have done is massage the figures by writing to people asking them if they are still on the list and if they have had a procedure carried out privately. The Government tried the same approach in the run-up to the previous election, as a family informed me. They eventually received an apology from the Western Health Board as their loved one was dead for seven years.</P>
        <P>How often do we see appointments made and then cancelled? I extracted information from the Western Health Board to the effect that there were 4,296 deferrals in 2003. Of that figure, 2,026 had procedures deferred once and 865 had procedures deferred more than once. There were 985 procedures deferred for lack of beds. Consultants deferred 406 procedures, 275 were deferred by hospitals and 638 had their admission date changed. What should I say to a man from an island off the Galway coast who has had an appointment cancelled three times? He comes to <Col N="1254"/>Galway, stays in a bed and breakfast, reports to the hospital having fasted for the night only to be told there is no bed. At the same time, the Western Health Board had a surplus of &euro;15 million in 2002-03. How can it have such a surplus with service like that? The 31 beds in St. Anne&rsquo;s ward were closed. Had they been opened with the surplus, that man might have been treated. He was told he could not be seen that day, he then waited around Galway all day before getting a boat back in the evening. That is the reality.</P>
        <P>An elderly patient had his surgery cancelled six times at University College Hospital Galway. If the reward system that the Minister is implementing is followed, health boards will cut back to stay within their budgets and be rewarded financially at the end of the year. It is no credit to the Western Health Board if it stays within its budget in 2003 because it was achieved through serious cutbacks. Many appointments were cancelled in 2003 and I am informed that it was because no beds were available in the hospital. No matter what the Minister of State says in his defence of the Government, that is the reality. I hope the people remember it on 11 June and I will tell the disappointed people that the worst thing possible in politics is to deceive people.</P>
        <P>The Minister told them he would eliminate hospital waiting lists although he knew he could not do it, and now he knows he has not done it. The waiting lists are now at 25,000, yet the Minister was to have abolished them by this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not giving the Minister full credit for some of his achievements. In the past 24 hours we have witnessed a miracle comparable to the miracle of the loaves and the fishes or the conversion of St. Paul. In the space of four hours the Minister has miraculously cured 4,000 people and removed them from the waiting lists. He could not do that for the past two years so I congratulate him. I give him full marks for spin and presentation. I remind him of the Cabinet meeting last week when this <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i> was prepared. It should have been prepared by senior civil servants in the Department unless they were assisted. I suspect they did their job and produced what was required. It happened about the same time that word broke that &euro;50 million had been squandered on little machines whose buttons people could press. This had no approval from the House. There was much panic at that stage. The Government decided to do something to deflect attention from the real issues.</P>
        <P>I do not know the terms of reference for the report the Minister received. He has successfully massaged the figures. He stated that 98% of those who were treated under the national treatment purchase fund expressed satisfaction. What has that got to do with the waiting list? Surely he did not expect them to say that the treatment was <Col N="1255"/>awful. Did he ask the other 2% what concerned them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There were many doubts about it before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not refer to the 22,000 that he managed to leave on waiting lists. He was supposed to have eliminated waiting lists after two years. The Minister is beginning to suffer the affliction of memory failure which has beset Government Members of the House in recent years. I remember him stating that waiting lists would be eliminated in two years, which have now elapsed. What has he done? He reduced them by 4,000 in half a day. What about the other 22,000?</P>
        <P>What about the hospital beds that have been provided for in the Estimates but for which no staff are available? This has happened in Naas Hospital, Blanchardstown Hospital, Maynooth Community Hospital, and with the recent clumsy efforts at Peamount Hospital. His Department funds facilities such as Peamount. The farcical aspect is that we were suddenly reassured the pulmonary care facilities at the hospital would be provided elsewhere. Lo and behold, the next patient referred from a hospital for treatment at Peamount was refused admission. It is typical of the ham-fisted way in which the Minister and his Department have gone about their business. He has failed the people and has failed to deliver on the promise he made before the last general election to abolish the hospital waiting lists. His time is up.</P>

	<P>I assume the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is taking this debate. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter, which pertains to the need to refurbish the laboratories in the Christian Brothers&rsquo; second level school in Midleton, County Cork.</P>
        <P>Dr. Bill Harris, with whom the Minister is familiar, stated at a recent committee meeting that there is nothing more important than a hands-on approach to science. He said teaching science as a history and mathematics in a theoretical and abstract way will turn students off the subjects. He challenged Ireland to produce an education system that is the best in the world and which is measured by the performance of the students. If we do not get this right, third level <Col N="1256"/>research and third level education in general will not matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister is probably aware that the school in Midleton was built in the early 1970s, 33 years ago, and virtually nothing has been done with the laboratory since then. The school applied for funding under the summer work scheme but the application was shot down and the school was very disappointed as a result. I note that under the scheme there are a number of criteria to be adhered to, one of which pertains to gas works. Projects are required to ensure that required safety standards associated with the use of gas in schools are satisfied. Those standards do not apply in the school in Midleton because it uses camping gas. The Minister, as a former Minister for Education and Science, will agree this is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister has much interest in Midleton and I ask him to take an interest in this issue. He has visited the school and perhaps he will stress to his ministerial colleague in the Department of Education and Science the importance of funding the school as a matter of urgency. The two existing laboratories are in urgent need of refurbishment. The gas supply system, having been in place for 33 years, has broken down and needs to be replaced. The electrical system is inadequate, having given a great deal of trouble in recent years, and the plumbing fittings also need to be replaced. The benches need to be replaced. The display cabinets are of a DIY-type construction and are not up to standard. A third laboratory has long been a necessity, and this is accepted by the Department. It is important that action be taken very soon.</P>
        <P>I see we have a changing of the guard across the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully briefed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Fully briefed. I worry when a Minister is late, states he is fully briefed and reads a prepared script in response to Deputies&rsquo; contributions. Maybe the Minister of State will tell me if we are wasting our time coming to the House at all. My experience is that we hear no more about the issues we raise and that they are shelved somewhere in some report. I ask the Minister of State opposite to take a personal interest in this issue. The school laboratories in question are in urgent need of replacement.</P>
        <P>I declare a personal interest in that I have two youngsters attending the school. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that, in this day and age, we need proper, up-to-date, safe laboratories. It is not good enough that a school laboratory has not been upgraded in 33 years. The Minister of State should dig out the relevant file in the Department tomorrow morning and ascertain what can be done for the Midleton Christian Brothers&rsquo; school. In spite of the odds, <Col N="1257"/>the school won a prize in science. One wonders what great work it could achieve if it had proper facilities.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should note that the new science curriculum requires each class to perform at least ten experiments per year. This is impossible in the present circumstances in the Midleton school. It is just not on and it is also unsafe. The Minister should ascertain, as a matter of urgency, what his Department can do to assist this excellent school, which needs assistance after 33 years.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the words of Dr. Harris, who stated that if we do not have a hands-on approach to science in second level schools, we are wasting our time and will be left behind no matter what we do in research or at third level. I am sure the Minster of State agrees with this and that he will do his utmost to facilitate and help. I will follow this matter carefully to see if I get a response from the Minister in the coming weeks. If I do, I will not be wasting everybody&rsquo;s time discussing this matter in the House. If I receive no reply, it will not be good enough. I await action on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stanton never wastes words in the House and it is always worthwhile to raise on the Adjournment an important subject relating to science and education. I thank him for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy of the Department of Education and Science on capital investment in education projects and the current position regarding an application from the Christian Brothers&rsquo; secondary school in Midleton, County Cork, received by the Department, for the refurbishment of science laboratories.</P>
        <P>The school in question is an all-boys&rsquo; secondary school, one of four post-primary schools serving the needs of the Midleton area. Enrolments at the school have been declining in recent years. The current enrolment is 426, while the combined enrolment in the four schools in the Midleton area is 1,907 pupils.</P>
        <P>The upgrade of the science laboratories is included in an application from the school authorities as part of an overall refurbishment project for the school. With an extension project such as that proposed for the school, the condition of existing laboratory provision is assessed as part of the preliminary analysis of need. Where existing provision is deemed to be inappropriate or otherwise inadequate, either a complete refurbishment is undertaken or, alternatively, brand new facilities are provided. While the need for improved accommodation at the school is acknowledged it was not possible to include provision for this project in this year&rsquo;s school building programme.</P><Col N="1258"/>
        <P>The 2004 school building programme at primary and post-primary levels amounts to &euro;387 million and will deliver more than 200 large-scale projects. However, it was not possible to include all necessary projects in one year&rsquo;s programme. The proposed project at the Christian Brothers&rsquo; secondary school in Midleton is one of a number, which has to be considered in the context of future capital allocation for the provision of improved accommodation.</P>
        <P>When publishing the 2004 school building programme, the Department of Education and Science outlined that its future strategy would be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officers from the Department are reviewing all projects that were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. They expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year. The needs of the Christian Brothers&rsquo; secondary school in Midleton will be considered in this regard.</P>

	<P>At a time when the Government is planning a pre-local election spending spree on health, which would see the opening of hundreds of new beds, the appointment of up to 1,500 additional staff and the commissioning of new hospital facilities worth approximately &euro;400 million, the authorities in Tralee General Hospital, County Kerry, are being forced to close a ward for three months over the summer because they do not have enough money to allow for staff locums when they are on holidays. This means the waiting list for elective procedures, such as very simple ones for gall stones and varicose veins, will increase. No non-urgent patients will be seen in the out-patients section during the period. At present, there are up to 2,000 patients waiting to be seen in this category, many of whom have undiagnosed cancers. This unacceptable wait has led to a legal case because a cancer was not diagnosed in time.</P>
        <P>In addition, the population of County Kerry swells during the months of July, August and September. The influx of thousands of tourists puts further pressure on the services at Tralee General Hospital. Surely, it is not fair, just or responsible to reduce services in what is Ireland&rsquo;s and one of Europe&rsquo;s best-known destinations at this time of the year.</P>
        <P>The proposed ward closure is bad for patient care and divisive for the staff. With proper funding for the hospital, this closure would not be necessary. The hospital was under-funded by &euro;2.5 million in 2003 and it is under-funded by at least &euro;1.5 million in 2004. A day surgery ward was provided and equipped but lies empty and unused because there is no money to staff it.</P><Col N="1259"/>
        <P>Elderly patients with broken hips and patients who require major surgery for cancer have had their surgery delayed because of the lack of intensive care beds. These delays increase the mortality and the morbidity of the surgery. A high dependency unit has been equipped and would solve the intensive care problem, but there is no budget to staff it.</P>
        <P>The hospital only recently received money for a third obstetrician, a general surgeon and an orthopaedic surgeon, years after similar appointments have been made in equivalent hospitals elsewhere. Indeed, those hospitals are now on the way to appointing a fourth consultant. The hospital is still without the services of a cardiologist despite that the death rate from cardiac diseases in County Kerry is the highest in the country. There are many other problems. When clerical staff go on holidays, for example, there is nobody to provide a locum so the correspondence and work piles up and awaits them on their return.</P>
        <P>Patients in County Kerry do not receive fair treatment. This is a direct result of Government underfunding of Tralee General Hospital. There are no corresponding cuts in Cork and we do not see the same hardships there. Unfortunately, however, Tralee General Hospital, which serves County Kerry and a much larger population during the summer months, is subject to blatant discrimination. I hope the Minister of State will have good news for the staff, patients and consultants at the hospital and for the people of Kerry.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the provision of services at Tralee General Hospital rests with the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
        <P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures fluctuate over time and may arise for a variety of reasons such as staff leave and seasonal closures. Tralee General Hospital will close a 30 bed general ward from July to the end of September 2004. The Department of Health and Children understands that the seasonal closure of the ward in Tralee General Hospital will be similar to the seasonal closure of some beds that occurred in 2003. This seasonal closure will enable hospital management to co-ordinate annual leave for staff and thus reduce the level of locum cover needed while staff are on holiday.</P>
        <P>The hospital prides itself on prioritising patient care and providing a high quality service. It has reported to the Department, for example, that when this ward closed last year, there were no delays in urgent or essential treatments. Staff rostered on this ward are assigned to other areas of the hospital during the temporary closure of beds.</P><Col N="1260"/>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children allocates funding on an annual basis to the Southern Health Board for the provision of health services. Distribution of this funding to individual hospitals in the region is a matter for the board. The haemodialysis unit in Tralee General Hospital has recently been extended. The unit now has ten dialysis stations and can cater for up to 40 patients. This greatly enhances the service available to renal patients at the hospital.</P>
        <P>Increasing the bed capacity of the acute hospital system nationally is a key priority in improving access to acute services. More than 580 new beds have now been provided in hospitals throughout the country under the acute hospital bed capacity initiative. An additional investment of &euro;1.7 million was provided to Tralee General Hospital to fund an additional 16 beds under this initiative. Approval has been given to the Southern Health Board for the appointment of a design team for the development of a new community nursing unit on the campus of Tralee General Hospital. This will represent an investment of &euro;8.5 million when completed.</P>
        <P>Base funding of &euro;1.8 million has been provided in 2004 to Tralee General Hospital to progress the appointment of a number of permanent consultants who have been in place on a temporary basis for a number of years. These posts are in the specialities of obstetrics, general surgery, orthopaedics and anaesthetics. I am confident that the measures I have outlined and the additional investment in Tralee General Hospital is clear evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the further development of acute hospital facilities for the people of Kerry and throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 83 together.</P>
        <P>A contract was signed with national car testing service, NCTS, in December 1998 to provide a car testing service for the State from January 2000 until 31 December 2009. Under the terms of the contract the performance of NCTS is subject to an annual review which can cover the results of NCT inspections, the results of planned or random sample test inspections, the results of customer satisfaction surveys, the audited financial statements, the company&rsquo;s financial position, customer complaints, the extent of compliance with performance standards and quality accreditation matters.</P>
        <P>The main inputs to the annual review are generated by the Department&rsquo;s ongoing supervision of the NCTS with the assistance of a consortium consisting of the Automobile Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The consortium provides the Department with the necessary engineering, financial, legal, operations research and market research inputs in order to gauge the company&rsquo;s performance against the specified performance standards.</P>
        <P>In addition, the contract provides for a mid-term review to take place five years into the contract, that is, at the end of 2004. While the mid-term review will cover matters dealt with in annual reviews, its overall focus will be more strategic in nature. It is my intention prior to the mid-term review to seek comments from all interested parties for consideration as part of the review.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to review the criteria for refusal of a NCT certificate. The national car test was introduced in order to implement the requirements of EU Directive 96/96/EC relating to the roadworthiness testing of passenger cars. The directive specifies the items to be tested as part of a vehicle test. The NCT reflects both the requirements of the directive and those laid down in national regulations relating to the standards which a vehicle must meet for use on a public road.</P>

        <P>The programme for Government states that a three year road safety strategy will be developed and will target speeding, drink-driving, seat-belt wearing and pedestrian safety in order to reduce deaths and injuries. At my request, the high level group on road safety has prepared a draft new strategy for the period 2004-06 and I have recently received approval from Government to publish the strategy. Arrangements are being put in place to provide for printing and publishing of the document as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the new strategy has taken account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the road to safety strategy 1998-2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy, further positive trends established in 2003, and the evolving developments in relation to the EU third road safety action plan.</P>
        <P>The strategy, which includes a report on progress achieved during the term of the previous strategy, will outline a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over the period in question. In overall terms, measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat-belt wearing.</P>
        <P>New legislation is being prepared in my Department which will provide support for the deployment of key initiatives in the area of speed limits and drink driving and will further enhance the enforcement capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Government approval to the general scheme for that legislation was given last Tuesday and I intend to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas during the current session.</P>
        <P>The number of fatalities resulting from road collisions since the start of the year is a cause of particular concern. The total for the first four months is 28 higher than for the same period last year. This situation has been exacerbated by the fact that nine lives were lost in two tragic incidents of which the House will be aware.</P>
        <P>The difficult start to 2004 will be given particular consideration by the high level group to ensure that the measures recommended in the new strategy will be implemented as quickly as possible. In addition, the group will monitor the ongoing effects of those measures and <Col N="1268"/>recommend adjustment to the focus of the strategy as necessary.</P>
        <P>I am determined to pursue a strategic approach to the improvement of road safety to achieve long term sustainable reductions in road casualties. The forthcoming road safety strategy will set out a comprehensive range of measures to ensure that we can build on the success of recent <?oasys _jy?>years &mdash; a reduction from 472 road fatalities in 1997 to 339 in 2003 &mdash; a fall of 28%, over a period when the number of vehicles, drivers and kilometres travelled on our roads has increased significantly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>I have recently received detailed proposals from Irish Rail for the reopening of the Cork to Midleton line, as part of the implementation of the Cork area strategic plan. The projected cost of the entire project is &euro;115 million in two phases: phase 1 &mdash; &euro;89.7 million for start-up of services in 2008 and phase 2 &mdash; &euro;25.3 million for further enhancements after 2008. These figures are inclusive of VAT and provide for rolling stock, signalling upgrades, new stations, track laying and park and ride facilities.</P>
        <P>On the Mallow-Cork section, part of the main Dublin-Cork line, new stations with park and ride facilities, are planned for Kilbarry and Blarney. Stations on the Midleton line are proposed at Carrigtwohill, Midleton and Dunkettle. I propose to bring to Government shortly proposals in the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 60, 61 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding, seat belt wearing and insurance offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda, in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences, in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</P>
        <P>The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.</P>
        <P>It is now one year and five months since penalty points were first introduced. At 29 April 2004 over 144,000 drivers had received penalty points since the introduction of the system in October 2002, including one driver who had reached the 12 point threshold which leads to automatic disqualification. I intend to introduce penalty points for careless driving with effect from 1 June 2004. This measure should have a further positive influence on the driving behaviour of those who have little regard for road traffic law.</P>
        <P>A detailed commentary on the information available regarding causes of fatal road collisions to date this year will be prepared by the National Roads Authority, NRA, based on reports from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will be set out in the NRA road accident facts 2004 publication. It would be premature for me to speculate as to the contributory causes for those collisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 64 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government provides for the continued support of our six regional airports. My Department provides a range of financial mechanisms in support of this objective, but it is important to note that the regional airports are not in receipt of state subvention.</P>
        <P>With regard to capital funding, grant-aid of approximately &euro;9 million has already been paid to the regional airports under first round allocations of the regional airports measure of the NDP. The primary objective of this measure is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports. A further round of projects will be considered for funding under the measure later this year.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers a grant scheme to assist the regional airports with marketing, safety and security related current expenditure. The total amount provisionally allocated in the Estimates for 2004 is &euro;2.24 million and the individual amounts for each airport will be determined shortly.</P>
        <P>EU Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 allows member states to establish a PSO in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving a peripheral or development region where such air services are considered essential for the economic development of the regions concerned and where air carriers are not prepared to provide such air services on a commercial basis. In accordance with this EU regulation, the Government has established PSOs on routes linking Dublin Airport with the airports in Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal.</P>
        <P>The total cost of air service subvention to PSO carriers amounts to over &euro;20 million per annum. Regarding subsidy per passenger, it is important to note that subvention is not allocated by reference to the number of passengers using the services <i>per se</i>. The governing regulation stipulates that subvention should be based on the losses actually incurred in operating the routes, taking account of costs and revenues generated by the services, subject to a ceiling represented by the amount put forward in the tender submitted by the successful air carrier during the tender process. In any event the subvention level per trip per passenger for the past five years is as follows:</P><Col N="1271"/><?oasys _cl11-?>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 106 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>The western rail corridor, WRC, was not included in the recommended investment strategy in the strategic rail review published last year primarily because it was not supported by complementary land use and transportation strategies. However, the review did conclude that the proposal was in line with the aims of the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>The review further concluded that the viability of such rail proposals is critically dependent on <Col N="1272"/>the local and regional planning authorities incorporating the proposals into regional, county and local development plans. Specifically, what is needed here is the integration of transport proposals, such as the WRC, with land use strategies that could provide the basis for sufficient rail demand that, in turn, would make the economic case for proceeding with the proposal. The viability of all rail proposals, including the western rail corridor, is crucially dependent on the creation of sufficient critical mass that would justify the development of rail as the most appropriate transport option.</P>
        <P>At the invitation of a number of the groups advocating the WRC, I have carried out an extensive tour of the corridor and visited many of the former railway stations on the line. My purpose in visiting the west was to meet and listen to those who are putting forward this rail proposal and to see for myself what is involved in the restoration of the line.</P>
        <P>During my visit to the former railway station in Kiltimagh I said that I could see the potential of the WRC and that I would wish to provide every possible opportunity for the viability of the case to be brought forward. I am anxious to provide the proponents of the WRC the opportunity to put forward their case and to facilitate a thorough examination of the proposal. Accordingly, I proposed to establish an expert working group to examine the potential for the WRC and I will be announcing the composition, remit and chairperson of the group very shortly.</P>
        <P>There has been no delay in nominating the chairman of the group. What is critically important in these situations is not the speed at which one makes an announcement but rather that the appropriate person is selected for the job. I am confident that we now have an ideal chairman for this group.</P>
        <P>All the regional authorities are currently finalising regional planning guidelines as part of the implementation of the national spatial strategy at the regional level. One of the core issues that the western rail corridor working group will have to carefully consider is the extent to which this rail proposal is facilitated by the land use strategies emerging from these <Col N="1273"/>guidelines. Any decisions in regard to the western rail corridor will take account of the ongoing work of the working group.</P>

	<P>The Railway Procurement Agency&rsquo;s, RPA, current estimates of patronage on the Sandyford and Tallaght lines suggest a total annual patronage of approximately 20 million passengers when the system is fully operational and established patterns of travel have emerged.</P>
        <P>The original Luas proposal, which W. S. Atkins assessed in 1998, consisted of one line from Tallaght to Dundrum-Balally via the city centre with an estimated patronage of 29 million. The latter figure is based on a higher level of frequency for the services than that employed in respect of the current project. However, the current system has been designed to cater for higher frequencies and hence increased usage should the demand so require.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 74 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>The number of applicants awaiting a driving test at 26 April 2004 is 120,541. Of these, 17,446 have been given test appointments and a further 13,835 have indicated that they are currently not available to be tested. The current average waiting time and numbers awaiting a test at each driving test centre as at 26 April 2004 are set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>The current waiting times are due to the unprecedented level of some 234,000 test applications received in 2003. This represents a <Col N="1274"/>21% increase on 2002 applications. However, indications are that applications have now fallen to normally expected levels and I anticipate that the current waiting times will improve over the coming year.</P>
        <P>Sanction for a bonus scheme for driver testers was obtained from the Department of Finance in May 2003. Under the terms of the scheme set out by the Department of Finance, the bonus scheme terminated in November 2003. The potential for initiating a further bonus scheme in order to address the backlog is being investigated. In addition to the bonus scheme, eight retired driver testers were re-employed with effect from 13 October 2003. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and at lunchtime.</P>
        <P>Preparation of legislation to establish the driver testing and standards authority, which will take on responsibility for conducting driving tests and will have more flexibility to respond to variations in demand, is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to submit the text of the Bill to Government shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 118 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment relating to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. As I have already indicated in this House, I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is being progressed.</P>
        <P>I do not recall the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicating that the establishment of a traffic corps was not an option due to legal difficulties. However, I refer the Deputies to the Minister&rsquo;s reply to a Parliamentary Question on 27 April where he also referred to the ongoing discussions to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>The question of the relationship that a dedicated traffic corps will have with the Garda and, in particular, whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner is central to the development of this proposal.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a corps that is wholly independent of the Garda would face formidable hurdles. The powers available to members of such an independent force would need careful consideration and there is the overriding issue of the capacity of such individuals to engage in more general police work. The need for consideration of this issue was referred to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 27 April.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>the financial mechanisms in place to review infrastructural projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in previous replies to this question, all major projects are subject to detailed assessment and evaluation including, at key stages, cost benefit analysis, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital projects.</P>
        <P>The development of PPP projects takes account of Department of Finance interim guidelines on the assessment, appraisal and procurement of PPP projects. These guidelines focus on ensuring that the use of the PPP approach is justified on a value for money basis.</P>
        <P>In March 2003, at my request, a new control system for major infrastructure projects was put in place in my Department. The infrastructure projects include national road construction, the Dublin Port tunnel, CIE and Luas projects. I have received monthly reports on each of these <Col N="1277"/>projects since April. It is my intention to collate and publish the reports at an appropriate time.</P>
        <P>The State bodies under the aegis of my Department, which are responsible for the delivery of capital infrastructure are obliged to comply with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, including conformity with the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure in the public sector.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above procedures, in regard to Luas, a light rail monitoring committee is in place comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Railway Procurement Agency. It is assisted by independent technical experts who report to the Department on a monthly basis. The Railway Procurement Agency also reports on programme and budgetary issues to my Department on a monthly basis. My Department continuously reviews this and other information on the Luas project to ensure that the highest standards of project management are adhered to by the agency. Indeed, my Department reported to Government at critical stages of the Luas project. This included reporting on physical progress and budgetary considerations.</P>
        <P>My Department also has in place an investment monitoring unit charged with overseeing the financial and physical progress of rail and bus infrastructure projects and ensuring the effective and timely financial reporting of capital expenditure by the CIE group of companies to the Department. The investment monitoring unit also engages consultants to carry out an audit of expenditure claims submitted to the Department seeking draw down of Exchequer and EU funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the national roads and public transport investment programmes is further monitored by my Department through the monitoring committee of the economic and social infrastructure OP which is representative of Departments, implementing agencies and social partners and which meets twice yearly to consider progress reports on the implementation of the investment programmes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 51 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 provides that the Luas system may not be opened for testing and commissioning or for passenger services until it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of an inspector appointed by the Minister under the regulation of Railway Act 1871, that is, my Department&rsquo;s railway inspecting officers, that the infrastructure and rolling stock <Col N="1278"/>is safe and suitable and that the safety management systems will be appropriate to ensure safe operation of the railway.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency and Connex have both submitted draft safety cases to the railway inspecting officers. There is currently no legal requirement to submit these documents. That requirement is contained in the Railway Safety Bill, which is not yet law. However, the parties concerned agreed to adopt the safety case approach as the means by which the RPA and Connex will satisfy the requirements of railway inspecting officers under the 2001 Act.</P>
        <P>A safety case is a document which describes how a railway undertaking manages safety in all of its activities. The safety case submitted by the Railway Procurement Agency is being used to demonstrate the safety of the infrastructure and rolling stock, while the Connex safety case relates to the safety management systems to be used to ensure safety of tram movements and passenger services.</P>
        <P>The railway inspecting officers are in regular contact with the RPA and Connex regarding the draft safety cases and have given phased approvals to the testing and commissioning of various elements of the Luas system. Such phased approvals will continue and full revenue service can only commence once the relevant approval under section 51 of the 2001 Act has been <?oasys _jy?>given.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 89, 91, 96, 107, 123 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>I was very pleased SIPTU decided to call off its threatened industrial action at the State airports in the middle of March last and both I and senior officials in my Department will maintain the process of full engagement with the Aer Rianta unions to deal with issues of concern to workers in the company arising from the ongoing implementation of the Government decision to restructure the airports.</P>
        <P>I have given repeated assurances to ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions that there will not be any diminution in the tenure or the terms and conditions of employment of workers in the company on transfer to the new independent authorities for Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. I have also undertaken, subject to agreeing suitable arrangements to deal with commercially sensitive material, to make available key financial information to the trade unions in the context of the current engagement process, which is being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, before the text of the amending legislation to give effect to the restructuring is approved by the Government. The information relating to the three airports was provided to the union&rsquo;s financial advisers last Friday and I have sought a response over the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>With regard to Shannon, Dublin and Cork Airports, the numbers employed in future years will depend on a number of factors, including the business plans and strategies of the new independent boards and the efforts of the boards, management and staff to grow existing services and attract new services. I have made it clear that I believe that each of the three airports, including Shannon, will be a commercial success and will maximise sustainable employment both within the airport companies themselves and in their catchment areas.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of three airports and to give both Shannon and Cork a fresh start under strong and visionary leadership. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. Issues relating to Aer Rianta&rsquo;s main subsidiaries such as Aer Rianta International and the Great Southern Hotels Group will be carefully considered in the course of the restructuring process.</P>
        <P>In the coming weeks, I will be seeking Government approval for the publication of the Bill to give effect to the restructuring and it is my <Col N="1280"/>intention to have the legislation enacted before the summer recess.</P>

        <P>I am aware of reports of a decision taken in the District Court relating to seven drink driving cases. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on a decision taken in the courts. I understand that there are at present 80 cases before the High Court relating to the operation of the evidential breath testing programme. The issues raised in these cases include the question of the availability of the option for an independent analysis of a breath sample. I understand that these cases will be heard later this month. I will consider the need for any action, including in the areas of policy, legislation or enforcement in the light of careful consideration of the outcome of the High Court cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 86, 104 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>The power to determine the locations for the provision of bus stops and termini is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section the Commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops and termini in respect of any bus route and in that context may determine that certain stops may only be used for passengers boarding or leaving buses. I understand that the Garda engages in a consultation process with both the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85. In addition, section 86 of the 1961 Act empowers the Commissioner to make by-laws relating to the use of bus stops and termini and such by-laws have been in place since 1962.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 introduces a number of significant changes to the provisions established in the 1961 Act. In the first instance, section 16 of the 2002 Act provides that responsibility for the determination of the location of bus stops and termini will be transferred from the Garda Commissioner to road authorities. This new approach reflects the evolution of policy and the development of the role of local authorities generally in relation to traffic regulation and management since the passage of the 1961 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 20 of the 2002 Act provides that the Minister for Transport will in future provide for the regulation of the use of bus stops and termini. This is to ensure that the controls to be applied to the use of facilities will be contained in the same statutory framework that applies to traffic regulation generally.</P>
      <?oasys _ah?><P>Arising out of the recent tragic accident on Wellington Quay, Dublin on 21 February last a Garda investigation is underway and, in addition, Dublin Bus is undertaking its own company inquiry to determine the cause and the circumstances surrounding the accident. The inquiry is investigating the circumstances of the accident to establish its causes and any contributory factors and will make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. Where such recommendations refer to the need for new statutory controls on traffic, including any recommendations on the location of bus stop, these will inform the development of the new statutory arrangements envisaged under the Road Traffic Act 2002 and appropriate legislative changes will be pursued.</P><?oasys _xh?>

        <Quest>the position in regard to motorists who received endorsements, penalty points and fines for speeding in urban areas in south Dublin in which new speed limits were imposed without proper by-laws; the number of motorists who received endorsements, penalty points, and fines in these areas who may be entitled to appeal the punishment; the timeframe for clearing all endorsements, penalty points and fines; if he has ensured that the new limits have been imposed with the proper by-laws; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Acts provide for the direct application of speed limits to all roads. Under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1994, separate speed limits apply to roads in built up areas, to roads outside such areas generally and a specific speed limit applies to motorways.</P>
        <P>The 1994 Act also provides that local authorities may make by-laws through which the speed limits that apply on a default basis under that Act can be changed in respect of roads specified in such by-laws. These by-laws are made by the elected members of the local authorities following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and, in the case of national roads, with the consent of the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>Where a person is detected exceeding a speed limit, he or she is offered the opportunity to pay a fixed charge. The making of such a payment will ensure that the matter will not proceed to a hearing before a court. As a consequence of the payment of a fixed charge in respect of a speeding offence, the licence record of the person is endorsed with two penalty points. If, however, the matter proceeds to court and the person is convicted, four penalty points will be endorsed.</P>
        <P>There is no basis for a refund of a fixed payment provided for in the Road Traffic Acts. The only basis for the removal of penalty points provided for in the Act is where a court accepts a late appeal from a person convicted of a penalty point offence and following the hearing of the appeal sets aside the original conviction. To date no driver has had penalty points removed from their driving licence record.</P>
        <P>As the payment of fixed charge is in effect an acceptance by the person that he or she has breached a speed limit, there can be no question of the making of a refund and that principle is provided for in section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the operation of the fixed charge system. The enforcement of speed limits, whether applied directly through the 1994 Act or by way of by-laws made under that Act, is a matter for the garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>While I have no direct function in relation to the making of speed limit by-laws, my Department has, in the context of the review of speed limits which will give rise to the introduction later this year of a new speed limit <Col N="1283"/>system based on metric values, written to all county and city councils advising them of the need to ensure that all of the speed limits deployed in their areas are supported by the appropriate legal structure. By way of response to that advice, my Department was informed by South Dublin County Council that by-laws were in place to support speed limits in their area.</P>

        <P>Under the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a duplicate driving licence, and to issue licences.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access.</P><Col N="1284"/>
        <P>I have received representations seeking to extend access to bus lanes to a wide range of other road users, including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists. I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users. However, as I have already indicated on previous occasions in the House, I will review the question when the number of bus lanes has doubled.</P>

	<P>The requirements of the practical driving test are set out in the relevant EU directive. A number of improvements to the practical driving test are in the course of implementation on foot of amendments agreed at EU level. These changes relate to random checks on mechanical aspects of vehicles which have a bearing on road safety such as tyres, steering, brakes, engine oil, coolant, washer fluid, lights, reflectors, indicators and horn. A study to assess the impact of these additional requirements has been completed and the results are currently being assessed by my Department. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is arranging for the implementation of improvements to truck tests, that is, parking safely for loading and unloading at a loading ramp and coupling and uncoupling the vehicle.</P>

	<P>Irish Rail recently completed a study on the feasibility of providing an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station to the docklands. At my request, this study also examined the question of increased use of the Phoenix Park tunnel for passenger services between Connolly and Heuston stations. The completed study has been submitted to my Department and discussions have taken place with Irish Rail, in particular, in regard to the timescale for the commencement of work on the project. The company is looking at the potential for making greater use of the Phoenix Park tunnel when the second phase of the DART upgrade programme is completed in 2007 and extra rail paths into Connolly Station become available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 93, 100, 102, 117 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a metro with a link to Dublin Airport. I have received the revised outline business case for line 1 of the metro from the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, which involves a line from the airport to the city centre. I am currently finalising my proposals on the <Col N="1286"/>metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area. I expect to bring these proposals to the Government shortly.</P>
        <P>I understand that the metro would take approximately four years to build. However, as the project would be a public private partnership, there is a strong incentive for the bidders to minimise the construction period as payment will not commence until the service is in operation.</P>
        <P>The precise route, number of stations and hence costs would depend on a number of factors, including the Government decision; geotechnical surveys; negotiations with bidders; and railway order process, including the public inquiry. In preparing a submission for the Government on this matter, the merits of all alternative solutions and routes will be considered. Again, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any of these alternatives in advance of Government deliberations on the matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has statutory responsibility for the implementation of an integrated ticketing system based on smartcard technologies for initial deployment in the Dublin area. The RPA has set a target date of end 2005 for the launch of the full smartcard-based integrated ticketing system in Dublin. It continues to examine all options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date. A first step was the launch last month of a smartcard ticketing system by a private operator, Morton&rsquo;s, on its services while another important step will be the launch later this year by the RPA of smartcards on Luas services with Dublin Bus introducing its system next year.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, integrated tickets, based on magnet strip technology, are available for travel on Dublin Bus and Irish Rail services and I understand that the Railway Procurement Agency is about to conclude a similar arrangement with both companies in respect of Luas services. The allocation for integrated ticketing in the 2004 Estimates for my Department is &euro;9.5 million.</P>

	<P>I have been encouraging CIE to dispose of properties which are surplus to operating requirements with a view to generating funds for major capital investment and to develop properties which have the potential to generate additional income for the group. While CIE has the potential to generate significant funds from property, any particular decision on any disposal or <Col N="1288"/>development is dependent on a range of factors, including market conditions at the time of disposal or development. Several sites have by now been disposed of by the company, and in other cases joint venture development has been adopted as the preferred option. No decisions have been taken on the reduction of debt as part of the detailed preparatory work on the restructuring of CIE.</P>

	<P>The development of policies on road safety is carried out on a co-ordinated basis in the context of the road safety strategy by the high level group on road safety, on which the National Safety Council is represented.</P>
        <P>Over the lifetime of the first Government strategy on road safety we have seen significant investment in Garda enforcement assets, we have provided the financial support necessary for the production and presentation of some of the most effective public awareness campaigns ever mounted in regard to road safety, many of which have received international recognition for their quality and focus. We have provided for major investment in programmes to address road collision black spots and to deploy traffic calming measures.</P>
        <P>Exchequer funding in respect of 2004 for road safety agencies under the aegis of the Department of Transport amounts to a total of &euro;22,488,000. In addition to Exchequer funding, the Irish Insurance Federation contributes to the National Safety Council&rsquo;s budget and funding is also received from sponsorship sources. The overall Exchequer provision for road improvement and maintenance works in 2004 on the national road network is &euro;1,280 million. This compares with an expenditure outturn of &euro;1,223 million in 2003 and &euro;330.6 million in 1997.</P>
        <P>Local authorities receive funding for road improvements and remedial measures on non-national roads which is not included in this figure. In addition, the funding made available for Garda operations supports the enforcement of road traffic law. That is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>In overall terms, there is significant financial resources available to support the delivery of the road safety strategy under the auspices of the various bodies tasked with the delivery of each of the elements of that strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>My proposals in regard to regulatory reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area were set out in my November 2002 statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum and are currently the subject of consultations with the trade unions. The detailed provisions in regard to the proposed new regulatory regime for bus services, both in Dublin and the rest of the country, will be set out in legislation which I plan to have enacted during 2004. However, in regard to the existing regulatory regime, the Road Transport Act 1932 provides for the licensing of private operators to operate coach and bus services within the State. The Department is required under section 11(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1932 Act to apply a public interest test to applications for licences. The Minister must consider whether the service proposed is in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.</P>
        <P>Generally, the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; is interpreted as being best served by enhancing and facilitating an expansion of the range of public transport services available to the public as opposed to allowing unrestricted competition for market share. The Department also examines applications for added value to the public in terms of the route and locations to be served, the timing of services and the days on which services are available, in order to maximise the availability, regularity and frequency of service.</P>
        <P>In compliance with the legislation, each case is considered on its individual merits and restrictions are placed on licences from time to time in an effort to avoid direct conflict between operators, including the CIE companies, while at the same time ensuring the availability of a good range and spread of services to the travelling public. These restrictions can, where appropriate, include conditions attached to a licence restricting an operator in relation to the setting down or picking up of passengers on a particular section of a route to avoid conflict with existing operators. However on some routes, particularly city services, some degree of shared running is unavoidable, particularly where route sharing is proposed solely as an essential, but incidental, component of the proposed service.</P>

        <P>The position in regard to the height of the tunnel is that my Department appointed consultants to review the feasibility, safety implications and cost of raising the height of the Dublin Port tunnel. They were requested to review a range of options for increasing the operational height of the tunnel, their feasibility, having regard to the state of implementation of the current design and build contract and the <Col N="1291"/>likely additional costs and impact on the project completion date.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed the findings of the report further information has been sought from the NRA pertaining to the report&rsquo;s conclusions in particular in relation to the costs should the tunnel height be increased. As a result the contractors have been requested to provide a fixed price cost for the work involved. Following receipt of this information a decision on the height of the Dublin Port tunnel will be made. I understand from Dublin City Council that the Dublin Port tunnel is expected to be completed in July 2005.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of the recent comments from the President of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors calling for a tougher policy on speeding and drink driving. Speeding and drink driving remain two of the most significant contributory factors in road collisions. New measures to address these issues are contained in the new road safety strategy, which is due for publication shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition, speed limit policy was the subject of a report of a wide-ranging working group who carried out a review of the present speed limits structures last year. New legislation is being prepared in my Department, which contains provisions for the implementation of revised speed limits structures based on the recommendations made by the group. Government approval to the general scheme for that legislation was given last Tuesday and I intend to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas during the current session.</P>
        <P>There is regular contact between the various agencies involved in road safety, including meetings of the high level group on road safety on which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are represented. There has been no indication from the Garda authorities of a diminution of the effects of the penalty point system.</P>

        <P>Some 2,500 transport services are currently being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative and 20,000 people are using the RTI transport services every <Col N="1293"/>month.

        <P>There has been no reduction in the funding for the RTI. While the national development plan proposed that &euro;4.4 million be committed for the initiative in the period up to 2006, some &euro;6 million has already been spent on it in the two year period up to end 2003 and a further &euro;3 million is earmarked for it this year.</P>
        <P>While there is every indication that the RTI has so far been a success, ADM has commissioned a full appraisal to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of the RTI in addressing the transport needs of rural Ireland. This appraisal is due to be completed by the summer.</P>

	<P>On 6 April 2004, I hosted a meeting of Transport Ministers from the current EU member states and the accession states to specifically discuss road safety. The EU Road Safety Action Plan proposes a 50% reduction in road deaths across the EU by 2010. At national level, the road safety strategy which I will soon be publishing contains a demanding primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003 period. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This target will contribute to the longer term EU goal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 103 and 105 together.</P>
        <P>The position in regard to the N7-M50 junction &mdash; Red Cow roundabout &mdash; is that the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council are currently preparing plans, including a motorway order and environmental impact statement, for the upgrade of the junction as part of the overall upgrade of the M50. The upgrade works at the Red Cow interchange are intended to remove as much traffic as possible from the signal controlled environment through the provision of additional structures and free flow slips that are separated from other traffic movements. This will significantly increase the overall capacity of the interchange and reduce the Luas-car interface so that both the road and Luas network will have increased capacity to maintain a satisfactory level of service.</P>
        <P>The proposed works will reduce the volume of traffic interfacing with Luas, that is, traffic crossed by Luas, by more than half. Subject to satisfactory progress in planning and design and securing An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval, it is expected that work on upgrading the Red Cow interchange will commence in spring 2005 and be completed by spring 2007. I understand from the NRA that the estimated cost of the upgrade of the M50 is &euro;590 million, 2002 prices, including a provision of &euro;37 million for the upgrade of the N7-M50 junction. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that such an upgrade represents the best technical solution for the Red Cow interchange.</P><Col N="1295"/>
        <P>In the meantime, both the Railway Procurement Agency and Dublin Transportation Office are satisfied that Luas, despite the current unsatisfactory traffic conditions at the Red Cow junction, will be able to operate satisfactorily using existing traffic signal sequences, pending the upgrade of the junction as part of the M50 upgrade project. The trams are driven in much the same way as a car or a bus in that tram drivers yield to other traffic if they are confronted with a red light.</P>
        <P>Luas passenger services will commence on the Tallaght line end of August 2004 and on the Sandyford line end of June 2004. The RPA has informed me that the project is within the &euro;691 budget and &euro;84 million risk provision as notified to the Government in 2002.</P>

        <P>My Department is currently concluding a capital investment framework agreement with the Department of Finance for the period 2004-08. <Col N="1296"/>The agreement will give formal effect to the announcement made in the budget by the Minister for Finance that five-year multi-annual capital envelopes would be introduced for all investment areas.</P>
        <P>The agreement will provide for an allocation of &euro;2.3 billion to my Department for public transport in the period 2004 to 2008.

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent comments from a UK-based health and safety consultant (details supplied) that overcrowding on commuter trains here may result in passenger deaths should trains be forced to stop suddenly; if he has plans to bring forward proposals to address overcrowding on commuter trains; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of comments made on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; in March by Mr. Dave Roberts, said to be a UK-based health and safety consultant. I understand Mr. Roberts expressed the view that crowded trains posed a risk of death to passengers should a train stop suddenly. It is not clear if Mr. Roberts was referring to a collision or emergency braking. Clearly, there is some element of risk to all passengers in the event of emergency braking and a significantly greater risk in the event of a collision.</P>
        <P>Research data on the safety implications of crowding on passenger trains is scarce. I am aware of one study published in 2000 by the UK Health and Safety Laboratory. That study concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that the net level of risk to the individual standing in a crowded train is any greater than that presented to a person standing in an uncrowded train. The study also concluded that, in the event of a higher speed collision, whether a passenger is seated or standing makes little difference to the overall severity of injuries sustained.</P>
        <P>This conclusion appears to support the view in the railway industry worldwide that crowding is more a comfort issue than a safety issue. Indeed, crowding appears to be the norm on mass transit systems worldwide, particularly at peak times. However, I am aware of the extent of the discomfort and inconvenience crowding causes <Col N="1297"/>many passengers, particularly those on longer journeys.</P>
        <P>I previously informed the House in response to Parliamentary Question No. 439 of 14 October 2003, that I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage on the railway safety Bill to provide the proposed railway safety commission with the power to make regulations to address the issue of crowding on trains.</P>
        <P>The benefits of the Exchequer investment in infrastructure can now be seen with the introduction of the 80 new diesel rail cars into revenue service over the last year. The additional carriages, together with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s revised and enhanced timetable, introduced in December 2003, have helped to alleviate the problem somewhat. A further 36 diesel rail cars, 40 DART railcars and 67 intercity carriages are on order. The DART rail cars are presently being delivered. I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is also examining the possibility of ordering 68 higher specification rail cars for use on regional services.</P>
        <P>This substantial modernisation and expansion of the fleet will go a long way towards solving the problem of crowding on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network.</P>

        <Quest>the analysis his Department is undertaking of the long-term strategic development of airports here; if his Department is considering the proposed development of a second main runway at Dublin Airport; and the analysis which has been undertaken on the effect of such a development on the other international airports here.</Quest>

	<P>With regard to Aer Rianta, there are two main issues in the programme for Government <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the autonomy issue for Shannon and Cork and the independent terminal concept at Dublin, both of which are strategically important issues for the long term development of our State airports and I have dealt with both of these matters in replies to questions earlier today.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government also provides for the continued support of the six regional airports at Donegal, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Kerry and Waterford. A range of separate, but complementary, financial support mechanisms will continue to play an important role in facilitating the maintenance of continued safe and viable air services at each of the airports concerned.</P>
        <P>With regard to a second runway at Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta currently has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, and to provide such facilities and services as it <Col N="1298"/>considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. The board-designate for the new independent Dublin Airport Authority will take over this responsibility for Dublin Airport once the necessary amending legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Aer Rianta forecasts that by the year 2020, passenger throughput at Dublin Airport will grow to approximately 30 million passengers per annum compared to almost 16 million last year. The company&rsquo;s long-term capacity plans to ensure that the airport has adequate infrastructure to cater for this growth includes the provision of a second parallel runway around the end of this decade.</P>
        <P>The proposed new runway will of course be subject to planning permission being obtained from Fingal County Council. In due course I will also consider this runway proposal from the aviation policy and shareholder perspective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of my Department&rsquo;s objectives is to expand the capacity and enhance the quality of public transport in Ireland so as to increase the patronage of public transport and effect, where possible, a shift away from sedentary modes of travel such as private cars. While buses, trams and trains include a seated part of the trip, all public transport trips involve the trip maker in a walk to and from the transport corridor. In this regard, I regard my Department&rsquo;s public transport promotion of a modal shift to public transport as a key element in encouraging healthier forms of transport.</P>
        <P>With regard to IBEC&rsquo;s concerns, I share the concerns associated with rising levels of obesity and associated health matters, and support the Department of Health and Children decision to set up a task force on obesity. The Dublin Transportation Office has confirmed that it and IBEC have agreed to set up workshops on mobility management plans for employers, including walking and cycling promotion measures; they are expected to be held in mid-2004. Incorporating cycle lanes as part of the city&rsquo;s quality bus network has been hugely instrumental in providing a safer environment for cyclists to get from one point to another and is at the very core of the success achieved to date in cycle promotion.</P>
        <P>The downward trend in walking and cycling to school is certainly of concern, especially as many of those travelling to school by car are making short trips that should not require motorised transport. However, trip length is not the only factor at play, and parental choices are key.</P>
        <P>One of the aims of the safer routes to school programme, currently being promoted by the Dublin Transportation Office, is to encourage concerted action between parents, schools and traffic agencies to walk or cycle to school and to actively manage school travel. An increase in the number of school children and accompanying <Col N="1301"/>adults walking and cycling to school can lead to safer journeys, healthier and fitter children, reduced congestion and a more pupil centred front-of-school environment.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Dublin Transportation Office that eight pilot school projects are currently under way, some since 2002, and are due to finish with the end of this summer term. The pilots are as follows:</P>

	<P>Traffic management in Dublin is the responsibility of Dublin City Council. I am informed that a heavy goods vehicle management strategy is currently being developed by the council to coincide with the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel. This plan has three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel; to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city; and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions, for example, through permit systems.</P>
        <P>I understand that Dublin City Council has circulated a draft interim report identifying the issues involved in the management strategy and that it is undertaking widespread consultation on the report before finally implementing any HGV management strategy.</P>

	<P>The report of last year by the panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey which assessed the &ldquo;expressions of interest&rdquo; in relation to the independent terminal concept at Dublin Airport referred to examples, particularly in North America, of independent terminals operating at major international airports.</P>
        <P>I am aware that a project involving private sector development of terminal facilities at Toronto Pearson Airport encountered difficulties in the 1990s and it will be important to ensure that the circumstances which gave rise to those difficulties are avoided in any similar project at Dublin Airport. The report of the expert panel concluded that an independent terminal at Dublin Airport would be operationally and technically feasible and that such a terminal is a viable strategic option for the airport.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to give urgent attention to the independent terminal concept and I will bring proposals in the matter to the Government in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
        <P>A memorandum on the matter of acceding to the ADR is being prepared by this Department and will be submitted to Government by the Department of Foreign Affairs later this year.</P>
        <P>The current legislative provisions relating to the appointment, examination etc. of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road are set out in the European Communities (Safety Advisers for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail) Regulations 2001, S.I. No. 6 of 2001. These regulations transpose Council Directive 96/35/EC of 3 June 1996 on the appointment and vocational qualification of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway and Directive 2000/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2000 on minimum examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.</P>
        <P>Under the regulations and directives, a safety adviser for the transport of dangerous goods must hold an EC certificate of training as a safety adviser. The regulations and directives also lay down the minimum examination requirements for the examination needed to obtain such a certificate. Article 6 of Directive 96/35/EC, relating to the validity of the certificate, provides that the certificate shall be valid for five years. The period of validity of a certificate shall be extended automatically for five years at a time where, during the final year before its expiry, its holder has followed refresher courses or passed an examination both of which must be approved by the competent authority. This is transposed in Ireland through Regulation 7(12) of the 2001 regulations, which provides that where the holder of a training certificate can show to the competent authority concerned, that within the 12 month period which precedes the expiry of the validity of the certificate referred to in paragraph (11) or of any extension of it given under this paragraph, he or she has passed an examination which has been approved by the competent authority, the period of validity of that certificate shall be extended by the competent authority for a further period of five years.</P>
        <P>I have no proposals currently to alter the existing requirements and I do not envisage changing those requirements in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority, the national competent authority in Ireland for the regulations, that it is considered too onerous to require training for safety advisers every two years, particularly in the light of the decision in October 2003 by the joint meeting of the RID Safety Committee, international rail transport, and the working party on the transport of dangerous goods, which works under the <Col N="1304"/>auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and which takes decisions on the amendments to the international agreements ADR-RID-AND on the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways respectively.</P>
        <P>That unanimous decision, to which all member states of the EU were a party, decided that revalidation of safety adviser certificates would be by examination every five years and that such examinations would be approved by the relevant competent authority in each member state. This position will be reflected in the 2005 edition of the ADR, which will become applicable from 1 January 2005, with a six-month transition period.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) received such a small amount of redundancy payment after 30 years of service; and if he has recourse to an appeal; if the rules for calculating redundancy have changed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned received his full statutory redundancy entitlements on being made redundant on 5 August 2002. The calculation was based on his age, length of service in employment and gross weekly wage at the time he was declared redundant &mdash; the date on which notice was given, which in this case was 19 July 2002. When the man in question was made redundant, the statutory entitlement was half a week&rsquo;s pay for each year of service under the age of 41 years and a full week&rsquo;s pay for each year of service over the age of 41 years, plus one extra week&rsquo;s pay. New rates of statutory redundancy came into effect on 25 May 2003 with the enactment of the new Redundancy Payments Act 2003. Under the new Act, an employee, declared redundant on or after 25 May 2003, is entitled to statutory redundancy of two weeks pay per year of service, regardless of age, plus one extra week&rsquo;s pay at the gross rate of pay, up to the ceiling of &euro;507.90 per week.</P>
        <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, retrospection was not possible, even in limited circumstances, because the redundancy scheme places obligations on employers and confers rights on employees. The legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General is that because the payment of a statutory lump sum is a legal requirement on the employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice of intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. It is regretted that workers made redundant prior to 25 May 2003, have not been able to benefit from the increased redundancy payments. The legal position cannot be changed, however, and special legislative provisions cannot be made for redundant employees who missed out on the new rates.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, future participation in community employment by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. The change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in community employment and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training and education options, where possible. Such options are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.</P>
        <P>The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. Participants are considered for such an extension if, on reaching the end of their normal community employment entitlements, they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment. A number of community employment participants have difficulty in progressing to open labour market employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has the discretion to give 20% of participants under 50 years of age extensions of up to a year to meet the needs of individuals who would clearly benefit from an extension in terms of their future employment prospects. Participants over the age of 50 may be given a further year on community employment, with a provision for a review at the end of that year. Further discretion may be given to extend participation on a case by case basis, subject to continued annual review. Approximately 20% of participants on community employment may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the current flexibility guidelines. An extension is considered if participants, on reaching the end of their normal community employment entitlements, are likely to experience difficulty obtaining employment due to age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally.</P>
        <P>Community employment is an elective labour market programme and, as such, the concept of progression by participants is central to it. F&Aacute;S employment services are available to assist participants who have completed their term of <Col N="1307"/>community employment to progress to employment on the open labour market or to advise on training and educational options available locally.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to indicate that all health service community employment projects, including those providing services for persons with disabilities, are ring-fenced and protected from reductions. Other services that are ring-fenced from reductions include drugs task force activity and child care service provision. Projects in RAPID areas are prioritised. Sponsor organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association have indicated that they have difficulty in replacing participants who have completed their normal term of community employment, due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. In this regard, F&Aacute;S has been asked to make every effort to identify community employment participants suitable for the positions in question. If F&Aacute;S encounters difficulties in replacing departing community employment participants with suitable persons, the matter can be considered in the context of the 20% flexibility in respect of extending community employment participation.</P>
        <P>The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy. F&Aacute;S is being given some flexibility in the management of the financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market, while facilitating the support of community services. As the allocation of &euro;351 million is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003, there will not be a reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels in 2004. On 1 January 2004, the level of participation in community employment schemes reached a target figure of 20,000.</P>
        <P>There were 1,955 participants in community employment schemes in the Galway-Mayo region on 1 January last, comprising 1,230 participants in Galway and 725 in Mayo. It is projected that there will be 2,055 participants in community employment schemes in the Galway-Mayo region on 31 December next, comprising 1,299 participants in Galway and 756 in Mayo. The projected increase in Galway relates to places being transferred from the job initiative scheme to community employment.</P>
        <P>The future structure of the community employment programme is being reviewed by a group of senior officials and F&Aacute;S. The group is expected to report to Ministers on the outcome of its deliberations shortly. The outcome of the review will inform future adjustments in the structure and terms and conditions of participation in community employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement under the new single payment scheme that individual farmers need to have 100% of the average land area that they had during the reference period would have resulted in serious problems for those Irish farmers who, for specific reasons, declare less lands in 2005 or subsequent years, than the average area of land that they farmed during the reference period. Ireland secured a concession from the EU Commission whereby a member state may make use of its national reserve to consolidate payment entitlements for certain categories of farmers on the actual number of hectares of land farmed in <Col N="1309"/>2005, provided that the farmer declares all the hectares available to him or her in 2005 and the total area declared is equal to at least 50% of the average number of hectares declared during the reference period. My Department is making arrangements to have the mechanisms in place in 2005 so that farmers may avail of the concession. The provisions can be applied to farmers who have afforested some of their land since the beginning of the reference period; farmers who have disposed of land to a public authority for non-agricultural use; farmers who had leased or rented land during the reference period but the lease or rental agreement has since expired; and farmers who declared lands situated in Northern Ireland during the reference period.</P>
        <P>The concession can be availed of more than once if the farmer concerned continues to declare at least 50% of the land area farmed during the reference period. It would benefit those farmers who are contemplating afforestation in 2005 or subsequent years. If a farmer benefits from the concession, his consolidated payment entitlements will be regarded as having come from the national reserve. The entitlements concerned cannot be sold or leased for five years and the farmer must use all his entitlements himself each year for a period of five years. Any entitlements not used will revert to the national reserve. The provisions relating to land availability cannot be applied to any farmer who disposed of land by way of sale or lease other than the sale of land to a public authority for non-agricultural use.</P>

	<P>The person in question applied for a premium on 35 animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. An inspection carried out on 18 November 2003 found that one animal in respect of which a premium was applied for, animal tag No. 181950860076, did not comply with the identification and registration requirements set out in paragraph 38 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The animal was rejected and a consequent reduction penalty was applied across the man&rsquo;s bovine schemes. Another animal, a heifer with the tag No. 181950810154, was found to be less than eight months old and has been deleted from the application without penalty. Eight unclaimed animals were also found to be CMMS non-compliant and this will result in a penalty being applied in accordance with paragraph 40 and 43 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The overall penalty resulting for the person named will apply to his bovine schemes only when all bovine claims submitted by him have been finalised.</P>
        <P>Correspondence about the matter was issued to the person named, who was advised that he could seek a review of the decision by contacting his district livestock office with new evidence or information that may assist his case. The applicant made contact on 3 March 2004 and his case was reviewed. My Department wrote to him on 29 March 2004 advising him that the results of the inspection remained unchanged. He was further advised that he could appeal this decision within three months by contacting the <Col N="1311"/>agricultural appeals office. The herd owner informed the district livestock office that he intends to lodge an appeal but, to date, the appeals unit does not have a record of correspondence from him.</P>
        <P>An 80% advance payment in respect of 12 animals applied on under the special beef premium scheme in June 2003 has been paid. The balancing payment and any payments under an application lodged by the person named in December 2003 for four animals under the special beef premium scheme are delayed pending finalisation of the suckler cow premium case. The person in question was paid his full entitlement under the 2003 ewe premium scheme and ewe national envelope on 17 October 2003 and 10 March 2004, respectively. The person in question was paid his full entitlement of &euro;4,443.97 under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 19 September 2003.</P>
        <P>Based on the information available about the rejection of one claimed animal, the penalty applicable to the premia due on his claimed animals under the bovine &mdash; suckler cow and special beef premium &mdash; schemes and on any related extensification payments will be in the region of 1.5%, while the penalty applicable as a result of eight unclaimed animals being non-compliant with identification and registration requirements will be in the region of 8.5%.</P>

	<P>The EU regulation governing the early retirement scheme requires that a pension be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension received by the participant, his or her spouse or a partner in a joint management arrangement. My Department has an obligation, therefore, to establish whether a person, on reaching the national retirement age, is entitled to a national retirement pension.</P>
        <P>The person in question reached the age of 66 on 17 August 2003. In keeping with its normal procedures in such cases, the Department of Agriculture and Food wrote to him three months previously and told him that he must apply for the old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and that he must provide documentary evidence of the outcome of his applications. He had not provided the information by the time he reached the age of 66, however. Therefore, the Department was obliged to suspend the payment of his early retirement pension. When the person named provides the information requested, the position will be reviewed and if he is entitled to any arrears they will be paid promptly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 to 153, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I confirm that I have received correspondence about the case referred to in Question No. 153. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Part 8 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the levying of deposit interest retention tax on certain interest paid or credited on deposits held with banks, building societies and certain other financial institutions. Subject to certain statutory exceptions, financial institutions are required to deduct the tax from interest paid or credited in respect of the income on deposit.</P>
        <P>An individual&rsquo;s entitlement to the repayment of DIRT is limited to circumstances in which he or she, or his or her spouse, is either aged 65 years or over at any time during the tax year or <Col N="1313"/>permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself, or became so incapacitated, at any time during the tax year; and circumstances in which his or her income, inclusive of the deposit interest, is below the appropriate income exemption limit for tax purposes. A partial refund may be due to an individual in the first of the circumstances I have mentioned if his or her income, inclusive of the deposit interest, does not greatly exceed the appropriate income exemption limit. There is no automatic entitlement to minors for a refund of DIRT, even if a minor&rsquo;s income is under the relevant income thresholds for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>I would like to outline additional provisions that apply to awards made for personal injuries. Section 189 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that certain income, including deposit interest, arising to individuals including minors from the investment of compensation payment awarded by the courts, or under an out-of court settlement, in respect of a personal injuries claim is exempt from tax under certain conditions: as a result of personal injuries, the individual must be permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental and physical injury from maintaining himself or herself and the income from the investment of the compensation awarded must be the sole or main income of the individual.</P>
        <P>An injured minor who, as a result of personal injuries, is not permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental and physical injury from maintaining himself or herself does not have a statutory entitlement to the repayment of DIRT deducted from the investment of compensation awarded, even if his or her income is below the income threshold for tax purposes. DIRT is applied on a wide basis and there are few repayment situations. I have no plans to extend the present DIRT repayment rules to cover the cases referred in the questions.</P>

	<P>The amounts recommended in the task force report, including &euro;18 million in 2004, were seen by the task force as the optimum amounts required if its recommendations are to be implemented immediately. I have made clear that the measures proposed by the task force cannot be put into effect overnight, even if the level of resources advocated could be provided, because of their range and complexity. The implementation of the recommendations will have to be phased over a period of years. The total allocation this year for emigrant services in the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo;s Vote is &euro;4 million. This represents an increase of &euro;1 million, or one third, over 2003. The lion&rsquo;s share of the increase, &euro;3.57 million, will go to the DION fund for services to Irish emigrants in the UK, &euro;400,000 will be allocated to Irish welfare agencies in the US and &euro;48,000 will go to agencies in Australia. I have made provision for grants to be made to &Eacute;AN, the umbrella body for voluntary agencies in Ireland providing services to emigrants, and to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. I hope to find additional funds through savings in my Department&rsquo;s Vote later in the year, which will enable me to increase the expenditure to Irish emigrants even further. As I have said in the House previously, I will continue to implement the report of the task force and to work in partnership with the Governments of the countries concerned and with voluntary agencies at home and abroad to support our emigrants overseas.</P>

	<P>My Department has no record of a concessionary post having been sanctioned at the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is <Col N="1317"/>determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing of the school in question for the current school year is a principal and ten mainstream class teachers, based on the enrolment of 268 pupils on 30 September 2002. The school also has the services of a shared home school liaison post based in the school, two learning support teachers, two resource teachers, a special class teacher and a permanent post under the early start programme.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the school&rsquo;s board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2003 was 250 pupils. The enrolment on that date determines the staffing for the 2004-05 school year. The enrolment of 250 pupils warrants a staffing of principal and nine mainstream class teachers for the 2004-05 school year. The reduction in pupil enrolments means that one teacher will be redeployed to the Dublin diocesan panel for the 2004-05 school year. Panel notices have been issued to the appropriate teachers in the school during the course of this week.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the school for special educational needs supports. Applications for special educational resources received between 15 February and 31 August of last year are being considered at present. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Cases involving children who started school last September are being given priority. All such cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of over 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. The applications are being considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special educational resources provision conducted over the past year, approximately. Data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of special educational resources provision are also being considered.</P>
        <P>The processing of applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. My Department is endeavouring to complete the processing as quickly as possible. My officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which was issued in September 2003. The circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
        <P>The teacher resources outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special <Col N="1318"/>educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower-prevalence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs. The detailed arrangements will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. Schools due to receive the additional posts will be notified within this timeframe.</P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the school management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils in that area who seek second level places. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. If a school refuses to enrol a pupil, it is obliged to inform parents of their right, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, to appeal that <Col N="1319"/>decision to the Secretary General of my Department. The section in question provides parents with an appeals process, if a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student.</P>
        <P>An appeal will not be admitted, generally, if it has not been made within 42 calendar days of the date on which the board of management&rsquo;s decision was notified to the parent or student concerned. A longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception if it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42-day limit. The Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil if an appeal under section 29 is upheld. My Department will contact the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy to advise them on the appeals procedures. Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the primary function of the education welfare board is to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an appropriate education. The board provides a welfare-focused service, through its educational welfare officers, that is accessible to parents, schools and others concerned with the educational welfare of young people.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the school&rsquo;s enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers, based on its enrolment of 220 pupils on 30 September 2002. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher, a resource teacher, two posts to cater for educational disadvantage and a shared home school liaison teacher. Based on the school&rsquo;s enrolment of 172 pupils at 30 September 2003, its mainstream staffing for 2004-05 will be a principal and five mainstream class teachers. The school fulfils the criterion for appointment of an administrative principal based on its staffing of a principal and nine teachers when all posts are considered. A permanent teacher may be appointed to replace the principal in such circumstances. This will facilitate a staffing of principal and six mainstream class teachers and the net loss of posts as a consequence of applying the staffing schedule is two mainstream posts. There are no plans to adjust the additional posts allocated to the school under various support schemes.</P>

	<P>Six exploration wells were drilled between 1999 and 2004, all of them off the north-west, west and south-west coasts. All six wells have been plugged and abandoned. Shell E&amp;P Ireland's Dooish well penetrated a substantial column of gas condensate, however, the results of which are being analysed. A second well, Statoil's Cong well, had both oil and gas shows. There are no remaining commitments to drill any exploration wells this year although I understand that a company has applied to drill later in the year.</P>

        <Quest>the basis on which recent cuts in quota and fishing time for salmon fishermen in Kerry have been made.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I rely on the advice of the National Salmon Commission and the managers of the regional fisheries boards to determine the terms of the wild salmon and sea-trout tagging scheme, which, <i>inter alia</i>, sets out the quotas for the commercial catch in each of the 17 fishery districts, including the Kerry district. The district quotas for 2004 have been set out in regulations which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, signed on 7 April last, to revise the scheme for 2004. The district quotas were firmly recommended to me <Col N="1326"/>by the National Salmon Commission following its comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the 2003 tagging scheme.</P>
        <P>When presenting its advice on the scheme in 2003, the National Salmon Commission recommended that a three-year strategy should be put in place to ensure, by means of progressive reductions, that the conservation limits specified by its standing scientific committee should be reached by 2005. In implementing the scheme in 2003, and to move towards the attainment of conservation limits in all districts, the managers of the fisheries boards advised that a pragmatic approach be followed, whereby the districts requiring the greatest reduction in their current catches to meet conservation limits should be targeted with the greatest cuts in quota.</P>
        <P>As the current catch model is largely based on mixed stock drift net fishery, it was considered that some reduction should occur in catch levels in all districts. This rationale was based on the knowledge that the districts are reporting entities rather than discrete catchments and the belief that a reduction in the mixed stock fishery in all districts will further benefit the attainment of conservation limits in districts below the required limit. The total allowable commercial catch for 2004 is consistent with the National Salmon Commission&rsquo;s recommendation last year that a three-year strategy be put in place aimed at reaching the scientific advice on precautionary catch limits between 2003 and 2005. The Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout By-Law No. 794 of 2004 prescribes, <i>inter alia</i>, the opening and closing dates and the weekly close times for commercial salmon fishing in 2004, including drift nets, draft nets and other fishing engines. These are unchanged, in effect, from last year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive programme of monitoring and control of sea lice levels at marine finfish farms is carried out on behalf of my Department by the Marine Institute. The inspection carried out at the fish farm in question in January of this year found that sea lice numbers were below the level specified in respect of that time of the year. However the subsequent inspection in February detected elevated levels of ovigerous and mobile lice. For this reason, a notice was served on the operators requiring them to treat the fish at the farm against lice.</P>
        <P>The first inspection of the farm in March found that, notwithstanding the treatment undertaken, lice levels were still high. Further treatments have, therefore, been undertaken by the operators. As a result, the second inspection in March and the first inspection in April both found progressive and substantial decreases in lice levels.</P>
        <P>My Department is monitoring the situation closely and has written to the farm operators <Col N="1328"/>emphasising the importance of taking all necessary and appropriate steps on an ongoing basis to control lice levels at the farm. I am advised that the operators are co-operating fully in dealing with the present position.</P>
        <P>More generally, I can assure the Deputy that the control of sea lice levels at offshore finfish farms is a priority, and that my Department is committed to ensuring the effective operation of the extensive and rigorous programme that has been developed to deal with the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The overriding objective of the Government is to preserve the salmon resource in its own right and for the coastal and rural communities that it helps to support. The economic goals for a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume and the development of salmon angling as an important tourism product are both fully compatible with the primary objective.</P>
        <P>The current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice by next year hold out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long term sustainable fishery for both sectors.</P>
        <P>As a result, I have no plans to introduce proposals to purchase commercial salmon fishing licences but I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of the policy outlined above.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures fluctuate over time and may arise for a variety of reasons such as staff leave and seasonal closures. My Department understands that the <Col N="1333"/>seasonal closure of the ward in Tralee General Hospital will be similar to the seasonal closure of some beds that occurred in 2003. This seasonal closure will enable hospital management to co-ordinate annual leave for staff and thus reduce the level of locum cover needed while staff are on holiday.</P>
        <P>My Department allocates funding on an annual basis to the Southern Health Board for the provision of health services. Distribution of this funding to individual hospitals in the region is a matter for the board. Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the level of funding provided for Tralee General Hospital.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may arrange for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with any of the following conditions who do not have a medical card, for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are currently no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>There are a range of other schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

Luas passenger services will commence on the Sandyford line end of June 2004 and on the Tallaght line end of August 2004. The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has informed me that the project is within the &euro;691 million budget and &euro;84 million risk provision as notified to the Government in 2002.</P>
        <P>In the period between 2000 and the end of 2002 Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann delivered a 50% capacity increase on the DART. The current DART upgrade project will finalise Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s plans to increase DART capacity by just short of 100%. Phase 1 of that project is under way. This involves upgrading platforms and stations on the DART line to cater for the operation of eight-car DARTs and replacing the overhead cabling. <Col N="1340"/>Some 40 further DART cars have also been ordered.</P>
        <P>In the period between 2000 and the end of 2002 Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann doubled the capacity of the Maynooth-Dublin line. This was achieved through double-tracking the Maynooth route and the purchase of new diesel rail cars. Some 80 new diesel rail cars are now in service providing capacity increases as follows: northern line &mdash; 43%, Arklow-Dublin &mdash; 30%, Maynooth line &mdash; 24%, and Kildare line &mdash; 130%. The first phase of the Kildare route enhancement was delivered in December 2003 &mdash; Newbridge turn-back facility and eight-car platforms at Sallins and Hazelhatch.</P>
        <P>Some 67 new mainline rail carriages will be in use on primary inter-city routes by the end of 2005. Work on re-signalling routes continues on target and within budget. The Galway line is completed and attention is now focused on the Waterford line, which will be followed by Tralee to Mallow and then the Sligo line. Up to 30 minutes reduction in journey times has already been achieved for many routes.</P>
        <P>Work on providing new platforms, signaling systems, track work and much improved customer facilities at Heuston Station, at a cost of &euro;117 million, is complete and has already made a significant contribution to improving the services on both inter-city and Kildare suburban services.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer has invested more than &euro;20 million in fleet replacement in Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath during 2002-2003. A further &euro;18.6 million has been spent on garage facilities, mainly for the new garage in Harristown.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer has invested more than &euro;10 million in fleet replacement in Bus &Eacute;ireann during 2002 and 2003, mostly for replacement buses for Cork city service in 2002, and for regional buses in 2003. More than &euro;200,000 was spent on Athlone bus station.</P>
        <P>Under the rural transport initiative, RTI, which was launched in July 2001, 34 rural community groups, covering almost all counties, are currently being funded to operate pilot rural transport services in their areas. Approximately 380 new rural routes have been established under the initiative and some 20,000 people are using the RTI transport services each month. Some &euro;3 million has been provided annually for the scheme since 2002 and a further &euro;3 million is being provided for this purpose in 2004.</P>
        <P>The public transport accessibility committee was established in July 2000 to advise me on public transport accessibility issues. The committee is comprised of representatives of a number of organisations representing older people and people with mobility and sensory impairments along with representatives of the principal public transport providers.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;8.5 million was expended on public transport accessibility projects for the mobility and sensory impaired in the period 2001 to 2003, mainly for the construction of footbridges and the <Col N="1341"/>installation of lifts for the mobility and sensory impaired at railway stations, the upgrading of bus stations, and disability awareness training for CIE frontline staff. A further &euro;5 million is being provided in 2004 for additional public transport accessibility projects.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>Good progress has been made in the implementation of the national roads upgrade programme provided for in the NDP. To date, 37 projects &mdash; a total of 256 km. including 76 km. of motorway and 50km of dual carriageway standard &mdash; have been completed. In addition, work is under way on 17 projects totalling 148 km, including 120 km, to motorway &mdash; dual carriageway standard, while another 17 projects &mdash; a total of 160 km &mdash; are at tender stage. In relation to the five major inter-urban routes, the position is that, at the end of 2003, nearly 30% of these routes had been upgraded to motorway-dual carriageway standard with work under way on approximately another 12%.</P>
        <P>Funding has been made available towards infrastructural works and upgrades in facilities to maintain continued safe and viable operation of the six regional airports in Kerry, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Knock, and Donegal. During the period 2000 to 2004 more than 30 projects were undertaken and grant aid of approximately &euro;9 million has been paid to the various airport companies to date.</P>

	<P>I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that, since the introduction of the new timetable in December 2003, capacity has been increased by 24% on the Maynooth route, which serves Kilcock, Maynooth, Leixlip and Confey. This has been achieved by introducing to the route some of the new fleet of 80 diesel rail cars that it took delivery of over the past few months. This latest capacity increase comes on top of a 100% increase achieved in 2001 when the double tracking of the route was completed.</P>
        <P>In addition, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has recently placed an order for another 36 diesel rail cars, which will be delivered in 2005. It is proposed that some of these rail cars will operate on the Maynooth line to increase capacity further.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that it has increased the commuter capacity of the Kildare route by 130% since the new timetable was introduced on 14 December 2003. A number of the new diesel rail cars, acquired by the company in 2003, were assigned to the route to lengthen the trains to eight cars. In addition, new turn-back facilities at Hazelhatch and Sallins were installed to allow more efficient use of the available train paths into and out of Heuston in the peak periods.</P>
        <P>A further 36 diesel rail cars have been ordered recently to increase further the capacity on outer suburban routes serving Dublin.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is now proceeding with plans to quadruple a section of the route between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch, as part of the Kildare route project, which will enable the separation of inter-city and commuting traffic and increase the capacity of the line. I await the details of the project as part of the railway order process. I understand that the company is in the process of completing the draft order and I understand that the application will be submitted to me in the coming months.</P>

To revisit these files in order to clarify the exact application of all public service pay round increases applied to prison staff from 1980 would take an inordinate amount of staff time and resources, which could not be justified given the present climate.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Irish Prison Service is in discussions with the Co-ordinating Chaplaincy Group, which was appointed by the Irish Episcopal Conference to represent the Catholic chaplains, in relation to the salary and conditions of service.

	<P>As I indicated previously, in reply to Question No. 175 of 7 April 2004 and Question No. 693 of 27 April 2004, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, in a judgment adopted on 9 March 2004, found that a breach of Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights had occurred in a case taken by a prisoner in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The prisoner, who is serving a sentence of life imprisonment, had complained that, as a convicted prisoner, he was subject to a blanket ban on voting in elections. This was as a result of legislation in the UK, section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which prohibits a convicted person from voting in a parliamentary or local election during the term of his or her detention in a penal institution. There is no such legislation in this country which prohibits a sentenced person from voting.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court, while taking cognisance of the fact that there are no statutory provisions which prohibit a convicted prisoner from voting, has held that the State is under no constitutional obligation to facilitate prisoners in the exercise of that franchise.</P>
        <P>I have, however, brought the recent ruling of the ECHR to the attention of both the Attorney General and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who has primary responsibility for electoral legislation and I will consider the implications of the court&rsquo;s judgment in consultation with my colleagues.</P>

	<P>The duties and powers of a peace commissioner as set out in section 88(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 allows for: (a) signing summonses (except against a garda); (b) signing warrants; (c) administering oaths and taking declarations, affirmations, information, bonds and recognisances; and (d) signing certificates for the registration of clubs. Peace commissioners are also empowered to sign certificates for the destruction of food unfit for consumption under food hygiene regulations. The issuing of summonses and warrants was subject to a number of legal challenges in the late 1980s and early 1990s and decisions of the superior courts raised serious doubts about the constitutional competence of peace commissioners to exercise such powers. Peace commissioners are, therefore, no longer requested to exercise the powers to issue summonses, warrants for arrest and to remand persons in custody or on bail.</P>
        <P>At present the powers and duties of peace commissioners consist primarily of taking statutory declarations, witnessing signatures on <Col N="1346"/>documents for various authorities and signing certificates and orders under various Acts. I do not propose to amend the legislation relating to peace commissioners at this time, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>

The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds.

The local residents&rsquo; association was invited to nominate a representative but has not done so to date. The committee met for the first time on 22 March 2004 and elected a chairperson. A member of the staff of the probation and welfare service agreed to act as secretary to the committee. The committee met again on 29 March and 19 April 2004. The first review of the operation of the office is planned to take place after six to 12 months of operation to allow for a settling in period. I intend to take appropriate action, if it transpires that the presence of the office is linked to a significant rise in criminality in the area. The monitoring committee will not have access to in depth details of the cases of offenders attending the office.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>When the equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006 was initially launched, it was envisaged that grant applications would be announced on a quarterly basis, to tie in with the anticipated timeframe to process the project applications. However, practice revealed that some applications required extensive consultation before a recommendation could be made while others were complete in their information and could be processed more quickly.</P>
        <P>As a result, the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, agreed to hold more frequent meetings to ensure that projects would have a timely decision to enable them to proceed at the earliest possible date. Consequently, the programme appraisal committee has met almost monthly since the programme commenced. Following the deliberations of the programme appraisal committee, I make decisions and ADM Limited enters into a final stage of consultation with the project promoter with a view to concluding a formal contract.</P>
        <P>The equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006 is a seven year development programme. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Expenditure under the programme must take place in a planned manner and covers the period to end 2007. Accordingly, grant approvals must take place in a carefully planned <Col N="1350"/>manner to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.</P>
        <P>I would advise the Deputy that there has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based childcare facilities. ADM on behalf of my Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. The Deputy will appreciate that over 1,100 capital grants have been allocated already totalling over &euro;114 million. Many of these projects are either awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed. In the event that a project does not proceed, the funding can be decommitted and made available to another project.</P>
        <P>The Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP in general and the capital programme in particular to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding including the capital measure in accordance with the objectives of the programme. This will involve some transfers between measures and the approval of the regional assemblies is needed. I expect that this technical process will be completed shortly and that it will bring to about &euro;157 million the total allocation for the capital development of childcare under the present equal opportunities childcare programme. This amount includes an element for the administration by ADM Limited of the capital programme.</P>
        <P>At the same time, an extensive review of childcare provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about &euro;35 million. The careful analysis of this information is essential if the best use is to be made of the significant capital funding being provided by the Government to support the childcare needs of parents who may be in employment, education or training.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that all counties have benefited from new projects and additional childcare places under the programme. I intend to use the remaining capital funding under this strand of child care development to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline will be reviewed to ensure that those projects which best meet the programme criteria and which can be completed by the end of the present programme will receive priority. The ability to bring a project to fruition before the end of the present programme is an important criterion at this stage as I am aware that it can frequently take time to complete a <Col N="1351"/>project and there are constraints to ensure that we maximise our EU funding.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>

	<P>The pilot drug court programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001 and the first sitting took place on 16 January 2001. Dublin&rsquo;s north inner <Col N="1352"/>city was chosen as the location from which to operate the pilot drug court.</P>
        <P>The pilot drug court programme marked a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and was designed as an alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. The project was evaluated by expert consultants at the end of the 18-month period in July 2002. They recommended that the pilot project be extended and the catchment area be widened to include the Dublin 7 area and for the period of the extended pilot project to focus on the research and development activity necessary to roll-out the drug court more widely, while continuing and expanding the current pilot to further test and refine the emerging model and to address difficulties which had been identified.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the recommendations contained in the report and supported the extension of the drug court to the full Dublin 7 catchment area.

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy on 1 November 2002. I considered this application on 5 March 2004 and <Col N="1353"/>decided not to grant the application. That decision was based on information available to me at that time.</P>
        <P>The applicant was informed of my decision in writing on 25 March 2004. A copy of the submission that was prepared by my officials, with my decision noted thereon, was released to the applicant. If that decision was based on incorrect information, I will certainly re-examine the matter. However, nothing in the documentation supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question suggests that my decision was based on incorrect information. Consequently, my decision still stands.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>the position regarding his examination of the inadequate pension of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who retired before 1 January 2003; and his plans to address this inequality.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12749/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to this case is that a 1983 arbitration finding, recommended that certain Garda allowances should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The finding was applied only to personnel who retired on or after that date. The pensionability of the Garda unsocial hours allowance was treated in a similar way when it was introduced. It was applied, with effect from 1 January 1994, to personnel who retired or died in service on or after 1 January 1993. The position was consistent with that in other areas of the public service where in the context of making allowances pensionable, the benefits were confined to those retiring after a specified date and did not extend to pensioners who retired before that date.</P>
        <P>In September 2001, the Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations are being agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group and a report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pensions parallel working group.</P>
        <P>The position on the issue of parity of pensions for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who retired prior to 1993, who do not receive the unsocial hours element in their pensions, and those who retired prior to 1982, who do not receive the rent allowance element in their pensions, is that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others, as part of its deliberations, but having assessed the arguments <Col N="1354"/>involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. Having regard to the report of the commission, I have no plans to make any changes in respect of the pensionability of the Garda allowances.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the concession sought in relation to the Garda allowances could not be confined to the Garda and there would be considerable additional costs with regard to allowances in other areas of the public sector, notably the Defence Forces, teachers and prison officers. A concession in these areas could impose a very significant cost on the State &mdash; in excess of approximately &euro;12 million a year and an accrued liability of about &euro;152 million, based on 1997 costs for Garda and Defence Forces pensioners outlined in the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions when considering the issue of extending pensionability.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that an annual pension in excess of &euro;19,000 &mdash; the current annual basic pension of a retired member of Garda rank with full service, could be regarded as being inadequate.</P>

        <Quest>the way the sale of residence disregard regulation within the social welfare old age and blind pensions regulation 1991 be applied in the case of a person who sold their house before 1991 in order to move to smaller accommodation and, as a result, lost their pension.</Quest>

	<P>Under the sale of residence provisions a person may sell his or her home and buy or rent more suitable accommodation <Col N="1359"/><?oasys _fc?>without the sale proceeds affecting his or her weekly means for social assistance purposes, subject to specified limits. These provisions also apply in certain other instances. For example, where a person moves into a private nursing home or moves in with a person who is getting a carer&rsquo;s payment for looking after them.</P>
        <P>In all cases the balance of the sale proceeds of the principal private residence is disregarded when assessing the weekly means of a claimant for certain non-contributory payments from my Department. The current maximum level of disregard is &euro;190,460.71.</P>
        <P>The special provision was enacted in the Social Welfare Act 1990 and in regulations made in 1991 and subsequently. Without further details of the case I cannot state how a sale of residence made before 1991 would be treated for old age pension scheme means assessment purposes. If the Deputy supplies details of cases to my Department the matter will be examined.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if she proposes to amend the rules of behaviour for persons in receipt of disability allowance under the rehabilitative care work scheme that will adjust &euro;240 as the limit in order the keep the original integrity of the scheme for the small numbers involved.</Quest>

	<P>My Department operates a range of employment support measures for people on disability payments in order to encourage and facilitate them to take up available work and training opportunities. One of these measures is the rehabilitative earnings disregard that applies in the case of the disability allowance and blind person&rsquo;s pension schemes. Under the measure, people on means tested disability payments can earn up to &euro;120 a week without it affecting their entitlement to payment and provided the work involved is rehabilitative in nature.</P>
        <P>The rehabilitative earnings disregard was introduced to enable people with disabilities, who were engaged in sheltered work, to receive a small top-up payment without it affecting their entitlement to a disability payment.</P>
        <P>In 1996 my Department took responsibility for the disability allowance scheme. Since then the level of disregard has been substantially increased. Many more people with disabilities can benefit from the measure such as those engaged in employment in the open labour market and participants on community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>The question of further increases in the earnings disregard for rehabilitative employment would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <Quest>the reason rent supplement was reduced in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; if account will be taken of the current rent of &euro;650 per month of which &euro;470.00 must be paid by the person who is finding it increasingly difficult to do so.</Quest>

	<P>Rent supplement is subject to a means test. Therefore, any change in the level of household income may affect the amount payable.</P>
        <P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted about the case. It advised that the rent supplement paid up to February was based on household income that comprised of disability benefit and maintenance payments. Recently the person concerned was awarded the one-parent family payment. Accordingly, her rent supplement was reviewed to take account of the increase in household income. She now receives the one-parent family payment, half personal rate disability benefit and maintenance payments.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is in receipt of the maximum amount of rent supplement payable having regard to her circumstances.</P>
