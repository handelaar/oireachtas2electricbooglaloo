   <Title>Nally Group Report on Omagh Bombing: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was debated last December and it is one to which all sides of the House were anxious to return. I acknowledged in my contribution at the time that many of the relatives of victims of the Omagh bombing would be disappointed with what I had to say. No Member in the House would indulge in an opportunistic competition of compassion or pretend that the determination to see justice done in this case is any greater or lesser on any side of the House. We all still revile the Omagh atrocity and its sick perpetrators. I am equally sure there is no desire on the part of anyone in this House to turn the issues relating to the Nally report or indeed the investigation of the Omagh bombing itself into party political issues. They do not have a party political dimension or an inherent partisan potential.</P>
    <P>It is equally important to emphasise that the Nally group was not involved in the investigation of the dreadful crime perpetrated in Omagh. That was and is a matter for criminal investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that he and his force, in close co-operation with their colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, remain determined to take every step open to them to bring the perpetrators to justice. I remind the House that the one successful prosecution so far on charges relating to the bombing in Omagh has been in this jurisdiction. All Members recognise the burning desire of those who lost loved ones in the appalling atrocity in Omagh for justice to be done and to be seen to be done. It is a desire shared by all right-thinking people.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Nally report, I recognise that most Members are at a disadvantage since the report has not been made available to them. During the last debate Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte acknowledged that I forwarded a copy of the report to them for their personal information. I felt that this was the right thing to <Col N="1034"/>do in circumstances where the report could not be made public, but was to be debated in the House. Both are leaders of the main Opposition parties and had previously served in Government. I emphasise that it would be entirely unfair to the Deputies to expect that they could properly put themselves in the position of deciding to put into the public domain any parts of the report, received on that basis, dealing with sensitive issues of national security. Decisions of that kind rest with me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I take full responsibility for them. Given the decision not to put the report into the public domain we are obviously not in a position to discuss the detail of it across the floor of the House but if there are any aspects of the report itself which Deputies wish to raise with me privately, they are free to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to repeat in detail what I said in the House last December but it is appropriate to set out the background and the main findings of the report again. Before doing so, however, I remind the House that certain legal issues arise because all the allegations which the group looked into were made by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is currently suspended and facing indictable charges on unrelated matters. I assure the House that this is not some theoretical legal consideration but one which places real constraints on what any Member can properly say in public. The report deals with the credibility and the motivation of that person. There is a real genuine constraint on me in dealing with that matter in advance of that person having a jury trial. It is not some smokescreen behind which I am seeking to hide. On the contrary, it is a restraint that puts me between a rock and a hard place.</P>
    <P>On 22 March the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, presented a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The report in question related to allegations made by a person described as a serving officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the handling of intelligence information concerning the activities of a paramilitary group in that year, and about drug related matters in the period 1995 to 1996. Despite the fact that the person in question made those allegations to a person outside the jurisdiction who has no direct responsibility for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was decided by the then Government, in view of the absolute gravity of the allegations involved, that an examination of the issues should be carried out independently by Mr. Dermot Nally, former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Joseph Brosnan, former Secretary of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Mr. Eamon Barnes, former Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge that type of examination was unprecedented and it underlines the utmost gravity with which the then Government viewed the allegations in question. I do not believe any Member would question the <Col N="1035"/>suitability, integrity, competence or independence of the people involved. I believe that we are all in their debt for undertaking what was a complex, difficult and, sometimes, thankless task.</P>
    <P>In December 2003 I outlined the three categories under which the group characterised the allegations but, in truth, in so far as Omagh was concerned, I accept that, at least in the public perception, the main suggestion was to the effect that the Garda failed to pass on to the RUC information which could have prevented the Omagh bombing. Obviously the implications of that charge, if true, would be of the utmost gravity.</P>
    <P>The group informed me that it held its first meeting on 29 April 2002 and subsequently met on 62 occasions. It interviewed 25 persons, some more than once. It received a number of written submissions, some from people it did not consider necessary to interview in person. The group acknowledged that it had the fullest co-operation of the Garda authorities, including access to all relevant material. The group also informed me that it had concluded after careful analysis that there was no foundation to the allegations which it examined.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the group dismissed everything the person who made the allegations had to say. Without doubt, that person submitted a considerable amount of factual information to the group but the core of the allegations which would have amounted to egregious misfeasance and non-feasance was examined in minute detail and these allegations were rejected in their entirety. People not familiar with these matters in detail might wonder why, if the report is so clear in its dismissal of these appalling allegations, it should not be put in the public domain for all to see. In its covering letter accompanying the report the group states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Report deals with highly sensitive matters involving the security of the State and possible risk to the lives of individuals. It also describes Garda operational procedures and methods, public disclosure of which could adversely affect future operations.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last December, if there were no other considerations of the wider public interest I would be more than happy to put the report into the public domain. The position remains, however, that I do not believe that any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, no matter how strong his or her desire to deal with the concerns of relatives, could simply put such a report into the public domain. The Taoiseach and I have been anxious to put as much information as we can about the report into the public domain. Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte have raised the question of whether anything more can be done to brief the families on its findings. In particular we were asked to look again at whether <Col N="1036"/>some redacted form of the report could be made available.</P>
    <P>I outlined last December the difficulties with a redacted form of the report. I have since looked at the issue again and the difficulties I mentioned cannot be surmounted at present. However, I hope, once the criminal matter to which I have referred is disposed of, to produce an edited version of the report. However, I must stress there are also national security considerations which will be there regardless of the institution or outcome of any criminal proceedings. I am prepared, if the families consider it useful, to meet them again as I undertook that I would be willing to do and to discuss the report with them in general terms. I do not want to mislead either this House or the families into thinking that I am in a position to disclose in detail the substance of the report. Some of the spokespersons for a group of the relatives make the point that they are the people who have suffered the most as a result of the bombing at Omagh and this gives them an entitlement to see the Nally report. I have no doubt that there is widespread sympathy for that point of view but as Minister I have wider responsibilities. I must act within the law, having regard to the rights of everyone and ultimately to where the public interest lies. It is by no means a question of my not trusting the Omagh families but it is simply not a sustainable proposition that the victims of crime have a right to all information irrespective of its implications for national security, the rule of law and the rights of others.</P>
    <P>This State, and the people of this island North and South remain locked in a life and death struggle with the murderous group which perpetrated the Omagh slaughter. It has been thwarted since then in barbarous plans to carry out bombings of the same scale and ferocity. It plans to strike again. My first duty is to prevent it from doing so and I will not help it by sacrificing security in a short-term gesture of compassionate transparency much though one would be emotionally tempted to do so. Having said that, I can assure the House that at any meeting with the relatives I will be as forthcoming as I can within the real constraints which apply.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the public perception that the core allegation the group was asked to examine was to the effect that garda&iacute; failed to pass on to the RUC information which could have prevented the Omagh bombing. As I pointed out last December no such allegation was ever made to the group. On this point the group states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The core allegations . . . about events preceding the Omagh bombing are that: a senior Garda officer would have been prepared, if a vehicle had in fact been stolen . . . to allow it to go through in order to protect [an] informant; and [that] no intelligence was passed to the RUC about information, alleged to have been received on the eve of Omagh that the RIRA, who had been trying to steal a <Col N="1037"/>vehicle in the Dublin area, had obtained one elsewhere (place, vehicle type and destination unspecified).</P>
    <P FLI="0">The group acknowledges that these are very serious allegations but goes on to state:</P>
    <P LI="1">However they are quite different from allegations that the garda&iacute; let the vehicle which was used in the bombing in Omagh go through or that they had intelligence about that vehicle. . . which they had failed to pass on to the RUC. No such allegations have been made to the Group and no basis for any such allegations has come to its attention.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is a radically important distinction that the group drew and sometimes it becomes blurred in public comment and debate but I appeal to Members to bear that in mind. I cannot overemphasise the importance of that point. It has, for whatever reason &mdash; and, I suspect, for hidden reasons of malice &mdash; become part of general lore that the Nally group was, among other things, examining allegations that the Garda had intelligence about the vehicle used in the Omagh bombing, that it failed to pass that intelligence to the RUC and that it let the bomb vehicle through. For the simple reason that nobody at any stage made those allegations to the group, the group examined no such allegations.</P>
    <P>Whatever the public perception, it was never suggested to the group that the Garda in advance of the Omagh bombing had any information on the details of a car which would be used in the bombing or where a bombing would take place. In that context I am aware of intensive media speculation about the matters considered by the group while its work was ongoing. It is not for me to offer a view on the basis for that speculation. I am aware too that some of the Omagh relatives appear to have been briefed in detail about certain allegations made by the person in question. The investigating group had access not just to the account of that one person but to a wide range of information which it felt compelled it to reach the conclusions it did.</P>
    <P>During the debate last December and during a subsequent debate, Deputy Kenny made several points with which I did not have an opportunity to deal at the time but which I will deal with now. I hope what I have to say clarifies certain matters for the Deputy. I want first to deal with the role of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. He said that Ms O&rsquo;Loan carried out significant preparatory investigative work which formed the basis of the Nally group report. In fact what happened was that her office was approached by the person making the allegations and subsequently she handed over a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Her report was available to the group and it did meet the ombudsman, but it was a matter for the group to examine the allegations having access as it did to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their records. While the ombudsman&rsquo;s report would have formed part of the material available to the <Col N="1038"/>group, it would be misleading to suggest it formed the substantial basis for its report.</P>
    <P>That leads me to another point, namely, that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland does not have a function in investigation allegations made about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be obliged to answer to the Northern Ireland police ombudsman, no more than members of the PSNI or the British police could be made to answer to our Garda Complaints Board &mdash; or in future to our ombudsman commission &mdash; if the board received complaints from serving members of those police forces. Once this jurisdiction was informed of those allegations it was clearly a matter for the authorities here to deal with them. It may be helpful to point out to the House that in its covering letter with the report the group stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">On the issue of [the person] raising his concerns with the authorities of another jurisdiction, you may wish to be aware that he told the Group that during an interview with an investigator from the Office of the Police Ombudsman in early 2002 he stated that he intended to report his concerns to his own authorities. He said that the investigator told him that he was of the opinion that the detective sergeant&rsquo;s own authorities would not deal with the concerns properly, that the investigator would make his own report and the Police Ombudsman would go to somebody in the South with it.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I will not comment on the veracity or otherwise of what the person said in that regard but the group in its covering letter brought this matter to my attention. Deputy Kenny suggested that I should furnish Ms O&rsquo;Loan with a copy of the Nally report on a confidential basis and invite her comments on its findings. I am, of course, aware of the esteem in which Ms O&rsquo;Loan is held generally and properly but she is a statutory officer of another jurisdiction who has absolutely no responsibility for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Apart from that, it is not clear to me how a person who has access to one side of the story &mdash; from the person who made the allegations &mdash; could reasonably be expected to form superior conclusions on the findings of an equally eminent three-person group which spent several months examining the evidence from both sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny also mentioned that he understood that there was an undertaking that there would be further contact between the Nally group and the ombudsman before the report was completed. I am assured that this was not so, and, I am not aware Ms O&rsquo;Loan has ever made such a claim. The Deputy also said in the House that it was clear that the ombudsman viewed the allegations in a far more serious light than the Nally group. That may have been a slip of the tongue and I am not sure what he intended to convey by that claim. However, I am sure he did not mean to suggest that Mr. Nally and his <Col N="1039"/>colleagues would regard the behaviour which was alleged to have taken place as any less serious than would any other right-thinking person. There would be no credibility in suggesting that three people with the long and distinguished records of public service, which these men had, would regard the allegations made in this case as matters to be treated lightly.</P>
    <P>Certain other suggestions have also been made about the Nally group, which also merit a response. It has been suggested that the group lacked the expertise necessary for the task in hand and that it should have been left, instead, in the hands of trained investigators. I reject this &mdash; all those involved are former public servants who had reached the highest levels in their profession. All three have had years of experience in dealing with difficult and complex issues of considerable variety, of weighing up information, forming judgments on that information and advising Governments of their assessments. The idea that they were ill-equipped for the task in hand does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Outside this House it has also been implied that the presence of the former Director of Public Prosecutions on the team rendered its analysis less than objective. This suggestion should be rejected by all sides of this House. Not only does it imply that the former director lacks judgment, but it feeds into the notion that, right from the beginning, the authorities in this State have been engaged in some kind of cover up. I have already pointed out in the House that the notion of cover up is quite simply preposterous &mdash; the record in this jurisdiction in dealing with dissident republican groups certainly does not support the notion that the State is providing cover for those organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny also raised some specific details in the House about the report, which I had not put into the public domain. I know he will appreciate the difficulties inherent in that approach and I cannot be put in the position of effectively disclosing the details of the report on the basis of responding to what any Deputy might say. However, one fairly widely reported point calls for comment. Deputy Kenny claimed that a key participant &mdash; an informant &mdash; was not interviewed by the group and refers to this as a major omission in the report. He said the report does not adequately explain why a group appointed by the Minister could not have done more to secure an interview with the participant.</P>
    <P>The report sets out the efforts which the group made in this regard and I am not sure what further action Deputy Kenny feels may have been open to the group where a person declined on legal advice to co-operate with it. Today I have heard the suggestion that since this person was on a witness protection programme, the Garda should have had some influence or leverage over the person, which could have been used to get the person to co-operate and to ignore the legal advice given to him. If the Garda used the status <Col N="1040"/>of a person on the witness protection programme for that purpose, it could be accused of attempting to taint or blackmail the person and it would taint the evidence that any person gave to the inquiry thereafter.</P>
    <P>In any case, while the group felt it was deeply regrettable it did not receive the co-operation it had hoped, it nevertheless felt not merely able but compelled to reach the conclusions it did. The group was asked to carry out a particular mandate completely independently. It felt able to reach the conclusions I outlined to the House. It is open to Deputy Kenny to say &ldquo;I would have done this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would have done that&rdquo;, but by that logic there could be inquiries into inquiries <i>ad infinitum</i>.</P>
    <P>That leads me to calls, which have been made, for some form of public inquiry into this matter. Deputies understandably make the point that we should do anything we reasonably can to deal with the concerns which relatives have. None of us can say that the people who suffered most from the atrocity at Omagh are wrong to explore every avenue and to press for action on every front. As I have said, I am prepared to meet them again in what I hope will be a useful and productive meeting.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot overlook the basic facts. One person has made a series of charges, which his colleagues all vehemently deny, after he himself was accused of serious offences. An independent group of the highest calibre investigated those allegations and rejected them as unfounded. In those circumstances there is nothing known to me or the Government which would justify a public inquiry. Repetition of unfounded allegations will not alter that situation.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a more general point of which we should not lose sight in this debate. The allegations in question, if true, would have amounted to egregious and wanton misbehaviour on the part of a number of senior garda&iacute;. An independent group has looked at those allegations and dismissed them as unfounded. We cannot proceed on the basis that the only people who have no rights in this matter are the garda&iacute; against whom the allegations have been made.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, if people wish to believe that some vast conspiracy is taking place involving many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, myself, my predecessor, the Government and the group to hide the truth, then there is nothing I can do about such a view. However, it would be a desperate pity if one of the legacies of Omagh would be that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which now and in the past has relentlessly fought the threat posed by paramilitary groups and whose members have risked life and limb to defeat the Omagh bombers and their fellow members of a murderous conspiracy were, however unwittingly, to be unfairly undermined.</P>
    <P>I know it will be the desire of all Members of this House to move forward as positively as we can on this matter and I have indicated that when these criminal proceedings are dealt with one way <Col N="1041"/>or another, I will revisit the issue of an edited report to go as far as I can within national security limitations to meet the interests and the genuine complaints of the Omagh relatives and of other members of the public. However, that is as far as I can go at the moment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Government for agreeing to move this debate from last Friday to today. I had to attend a European People&rsquo;s Party meeting in Madrid. I am grateful to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for giving me a copy of the Nally report in confidence. I have respected that confidence and will continue to do so. The report is not mine to publish and clearly I have no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Nally report was commissioned following documented evidence of allegations given to the Government by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. She obviously felt that the information given to her was of sufficient importance to warrant an investigation of the allegations made. In doing so she travelled to Dublin to present that to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who passed it on to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, who subsequently commissioned the Nally report.</P>
    <P>This short D&aacute;il debate allows for some focus on the process and methodology involved and on the attitude adopted by Government towards the matter. It also allows us to focus on the requirements and needs of the families of the victims and, most importantly, on the type and extent of the follow-up now required.</P>
    <P>The date of 15 August 1998 is a day which will be forever etched on the memories of those who lost loved ones in the single worst atrocity of the past 30 years. No person has been charged with this atrocity despite the fact that a great deal of evidence exists as to who the perpetrators were. The effect of the Omagh bomb has consumed the lives of the families of the 31 victims each day since. Their search is for the truth and to ensure that justice is seen to be done. The Government has a duty to see that this happens in accordance with its stated position on the night of the occurrence of the atrocity. Today&rsquo;s debate centres on a report based on allegations of Garda activity in the period both before and after this truly tragic incident.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not have a monopoly on compassion, nor does anyone in this House. In the run-up to the current position the Government could have done considerably more in dealing with those who lost loved ones as a result of this bomb. The debate is not just about a report but also about lives lost and damaged by the Omagh bomb. We are here to talk about how the Government in the context of the Nally report has treated the survivors of this bomb.</P>
   
    <P>The Government should be aware and should recognise that for the families of the Omagh bomb victims, the Nally report is not just another <Col N="1042"/>official document waiting to be published. For these families, this report is a reflection on the end of life. For many of them, this report marks a day when they too stopped living and began to simply exist. To sit with these ordinary people and hear them take their turn around the table outlining whom and what they lost on that August day five and a half years ago, is an exceptionally sobering experience. The Government should be under no illusion. The report that it has refused to publish, even in part, has become for the families of Omagh a critique not just of the murder but of the humanity of these ordinary people living ordinary lives.</P>
    <P>The Government has treated itself to the luxury of keeping these victims anonymous. It has treated them as an amorphous mass. The families, though, have no such luxury nor, in the five years since 15 August 1998, have they had a scintilla of comfort from the Government. They have had no proper meeting despite five years of repeated requests. The 15 minutes offered last Thursday is simply not adequate. I will remove the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government from their comfort zone. These dead people are not anonymous. Those who died were Unionists, toddlers, babies, schoolgoers, Orangemen, Celtic fanatics, Manchester United fanatics and car fanatics. They were Sunday school teachers, businesspeople, engineers, Oxfam volunteers and university undergraduates. They came from Omagh, Buncrana, Newtownsaville and even Madrid. These anonymous people had just one thing in common: their massacre. None of them came home.</P>
    <P>Although their murder and the Government&rsquo;s stonewalling of their relatives on the publication of the Nally report is bad, apparently it is not enough. The Taoiseach appointed an emissary to meet the alleged murderers, the Real IRA. He misled the families, the public and this House about his Government&rsquo;s dealings with these terrorists. On 5, 12 and 19 November last, the Taoiseach asserted in this House his commitment to publishing the Nally report. On 11 December, the T&aacute;naiste told the D&aacute;il that the Minister &ldquo;has the report and is anxious to publish it as quickly as possible&rdquo;. Given those assertions, is it not then offensive to the families for the Government to cite security as a reason the report cannot be published? Aspects of the Nally report have been selectively leaked to a certain journalist, among them the main conclusions and the Government&rsquo;s stated intention never to publish the report in full despite its public assertions to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Apart from the lack of political will, there is no valid reason the Government should not give the Omagh families an edited version of the report. It is the least they deserve after their appalling ordeal and the way they have been treated by the Government. I was glad to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirm in his contribution that he was prepared to meet with the families again. I hope this happens soon and <Col N="1043"/>that the Minister gives them a reasonable amount of time and discusses elements of the report with them. Yesterday I met again the main body of the families of the victims. They fully understand and appreciate that the Minister cannot publish the Nally report in full, nor do they expect him to do so. However, they do expect that the Minister to talk to them about the process of the report and the main findings without infringing on issues of State security that are central to his constitutional responsibility as Minister. The Minister referred to the verbal assurance that was given to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. I must take the Minister&rsquo;s word that such assurance was not given by the group, although the information I have differs from that.</P>
    <P>The Nally group comprised three eminent public servants to whom no blame can be attached. However, none of them has the investigative background necessary to get to the truth of the grave matter of the allegations given to Mrs. O&rsquo;Loan, nor did the group have any judicial or compellability powers. I have referred previously, as has the Minister, to the fact that the Nally group was not in a position to interview a key witness who is being protected by the State under the witness protection scheme. In a report that seeks to draw conclusions from seriously conflicting evidence, surely this is a fundamental inadequacy. Neither does the report explain in a detailed way why a group appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could not have done more to secure an interview with this person. The Minister has referred to the witness protection programme, but there are clearly precedents in which people on such programmes have given important evidence. In this case, surely the evidence of a central figure would have been important.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The witness refused to co-operate with the group on legal advice. Why does the Deputy not acknowledge that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions were submitted to him and to his legal officer. Surely if the State sponsors the witness protection programme, it can lay down conditions that the legal adviser to the witness should be able to vet the answers that were given. Surely some contact should have been made with this person, who is central to the issue of the vehicles and the allegations made to the police ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I differ from the Minister in asserting that these allegations were given far more credence in Northern Ireland than they have been here. I will not say in the House that any member of the Garda would willingly or knowingly involve himself in any way in allegations to which the Minister has referred in his contribution, namely, that a Garda officer of senior rank would knowingly allow a vehicle to proceed if there was a question of the potential placing of a bomb in Omagh or anywhere else which would result in <Col N="1044"/>damage to life and limb. However, there are differences of opinion arising from the allegations about this.</P>
    <P>If we want to move forward, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister should instigate a Cory-style investigation and report on the Nally investigation, which could result in recommendations to both Governments about how best to proceed. Criminal proceedings and investigations are ongoing, but the Minister is aware that the Nally report contains serious contradictions in the way evidence is viewed. The cost of a Cory-style investigation would not be high compared to those of other public inquiries, but it would provide a focus. A person of international significance would be in a position, through a legal adviser, to have evidence and responses made available from the so-called informant.</P>
    <P>The Omagh families need a version of the Nally report. They are entitled to know everything they can about the thinking and circumstances that caused their family members to be murdered. They need the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give them the time and the respect they deserve. The Minister has confirmed this and I hope the Taoiseach will do the same. Just as there must be justice for the forgotten, there must equally be justice for these people &mdash; the ignored. Will they too wait 30 years to hear the truth? That is a life sentence.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in thinking that the Government&rsquo;s treatment of these people is a national disgrace. To make some small redress and to restore some national dignity in the matter I will read the names of the men, women and children who died in the single biggest atrocity of the Troubles, the Omagh bombing of 15 August 1998: Olive Hawkes, Jolene Marlow, Debra Cartwright, Mary Grimes, her daughter Avril Monaghan, Avril&rsquo;s unborn twins and her baby daughter Maria Monaghan, Sean McLoughlin, James Barker, Oran Doherty, Geraldine Breslin, Brenda Logue, Philomena Skelton, Gareth Conway, baby Breda Devine, Lorrayne Wilson, Samantha McFarland, Julia Hughes, Elizabeth Rush, Rocio Abad Ramos, Fernando Blasco Baselga, Esther Gibson, Anne McCombe, Vide Short, Adrian Gallagher, Alan Radford, Fred White, his son Brian White, Brian McCrory and Se&aacute;n McGrath. At the funeral of Philomena Skelton, the bishop said:</P>
    <P LI="1">What happened in Market Street was something that was palpable evil &mdash; to plant a bomb in a crowded street was a sinful act, that nothing can condone, excuse or allow to be talked away. But if the sense of evil was palpable, even more palpable was the outpouring of love and caring. What we will remember most is the way in which people from all walks of life responded to this human tragedy.</P><Col N="1045"/>
    <P>Five and a half years on, the Irish Government might join them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should meet the families and explain the process involved, in so far as they can. Furthermore, I expect the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with their counterparts in the British Government, to point a way forward by holding a Cory-style investigation which could provide recommendations as to how best the families can be helped in their quest for truth and justice. Otherwise, a future Member of this House will, in perhaps 20 years&rsquo; time and just as current Members have done with regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, demand of the Government then in office that an investigation be held into the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>The perpetrators of this crime are still alive and free. When one talks to members of the victims&rsquo; families, whose loved ones were blown through shop shutters or killed instantly by flying shrapnel, one begins to understand the humanitarian responsibility the Government has in this matter. I respect the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the danger in which its members and members of the PSNI put themselves when dealing with terrorism and terrorist activity. This report, however, is just the beginning. There are serious unanswered questions and I have given my view on how we should proceed. I hope the Government will respond accordingly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On 16 December last year, I said in the House, in respect of the allegations that have given rise to the Nally report: &ldquo;...there can be no argument but that they are the most profoundly serious that could be made against a law enforcement agency tasked with the preservation of life and public safety&rdquo;. I pointed to the report&rsquo;s firm conclusion that there was no foundation for the allegations and that &ldquo;the allegations were a direct consequence of and were motivated by concerns arising from the difficulties in which the named garda found himself with his superiors in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the criminal law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The sensitivity of its contents had been impressed upon me and the Minister&rsquo;s intention not to publish the report had been made known in advance. As I was conscious of the high degree of sensitivity stated to attach to the report, I could not then place the detail of it in the public domain to any significant extent greater than the Minister had done. My notes made then will, however, form the basis of what I want to say now. I made it clear that, in the time available to me to digest the report, I was not in a position to &ldquo;query the group&rsquo;s methodology of analysis, to point to unexplored lines of inquiry, to put forward alternative hypotheses or to second-guess its conclusions&rdquo;. Finally, I called on the Minister, in the interim period between that date and today&rsquo;s opportunity for further statements on the matter, to examine whether a version of this report that <Col N="1046"/>did not prejudice ongoing security operations could be made available to the Omagh families.</P>
    <P>However, despite requests from the victims group and from Deputy Kenny and me, the Minister and the Taoiseach have apparently felt unable to respond to those urgings, presumably for the reasons the Minister outlined earlier. In these circumstances, I am at a loss to know what purpose was served by supplying both me and Deputy Kenny, alone of the 151 non-Cabinet Members of this House &mdash; presuming that all members of the Government were given a copy &mdash; with the report and then timetabling two sessions of statements in the House on a document that not only the public but most of the Members have not seen and which those who have seen it felt obliged not to discuss in the detail that it undoubtedly deserves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some type of convention was in the process of being invented, along the lines of the convention that a British Government might share confidences with privy counsellors on the opposition front benches. It was, for example, pointed out that both Deputy Kenny and I were former Ministers and members of the Cabinet. If some such distinction was in the Minister&rsquo;s mind when he chose to supply us with the report, it is a precedent which may be better not repeated. If the Government feels unable to publish even a redacted version of a sensitive document, I do not want to see it because, if I am not happy with it, I am in not in an position to explain my concerns as adequately as I should. In fact, the net effect might be to spancel Opposition scrutiny, rather than assist in informed debate. I do not claim that the Minister had such a purpose here. I do not regard my having seen the report and my having had time to think about it in greater detail than when I first spoke on it as conferring a seal of approval on its methodology.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter of common and public knowledge that the report deals with an informant of the detective sergeant referred to by the Minister. That informant went to the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman with his allegations as to how the intelligence he was providing was dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The relatives of those killed in the bombing have called on the Garda to allow the PSNI team investigating Omagh to interview the informant who now lives abroad under the Garda witness protection programme. The PSNI&rsquo;s senior investigating officer, Superintendent Norman Baxter, has apparently made three requests to the Garda to interview the said informant, all of which have been denied.</P>
    <P>The informant named was a car thief who is said to have had contacts first with the Provisional IRA and then, after the 1997 split, with the Real IRA. He provided intelligence on nine Real IRA bomb plots between February and August 1998. He is widely reported to have organised the theft of cars which were used to transport bombs and mortar rockets to Britain and Northern Ireland. In the transcript of a taped <Col N="1047"/>conversation between the informant and the detective sergeant, reported in the British <i>Observer</i>, he says he gave the Garda intelligence about a stolen car to be used in a bombing in Northern Ireland, just 24 hours before the Omagh massacre: &ldquo;They [the Real IRA] had got a car and they [the Garda] knew it was moving; they knew it was moving within 24 hours of that stage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have some problems with more than one aspect of the report. Deputy Kenny has previously referred to the fact that the major source of the allegations investigated by the Nally group, whose communications with Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan were the cause of the original report by her to the Irish Government, has not been interviewed by the Nally group, let alone by the PSNI. This is despite the fact that the informant apparently remains on the witness protection programme and is in liaison with members of the force &mdash; the force against some of whose most senior officers he makes serious allegations. I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments about that. The informant&rsquo;s whereabouts are known, but it was not clear from my somewhat hurried reading of the report in December that he had declined on legal advice to assist the investigation. I have no reason to suspect that if the informant had been interviewed, the conclusions would have been in any way different.</P>
    <P>However, it remains a difficulty and other issues arise. In general, it appears there is a significant difference between what the inquiry team was willing to accept from the garda&iacute; by way of evidence and explanation as opposed to what it accepted from the disaffected detective sergeant. The team went through a forensic examination of the sergeant&rsquo;s evidence and highlighted inconsistencies and contradictions. However, when it came to the garda&iacute;, a similar level of rigour was not applied and claims by garda&iacute; that were unsupported by evidence were accepted without doubt. Without having been present at the interviews it is difficult to do more than record that observation.</P>
    <P>The first allegation dealt with in the Nally report has to do with the theft of a car in this jurisdiction, which may later have been used in the mortar bombing of Armagh RUC station on 10 March 1998. It is common case that the detective&rsquo;s informant had contacted him on 13 February of that year to say that he had been asked by an individual described as &ldquo;one of the main organisers of logistical arrangements&rdquo; for the Real IRA, to steal a high-powered hatchback. Although information about a car and its storage locations were provided to the detective, it is also common case that none of this information was communicated to the RUC. The stolen car was found burnt out in County Monaghan three days after the Armagh bombing. The Garda conceded the car may have been used in the mortar attack but said it was unaware of any firm investigative link.</P><Col N="1048"/>
    <P>Outlining why the information about the theft of the car was not passed on to the RUC, the report describes a senior Garda officer as explaining:</P>
    <P LI="1">It has to be borne in mind that the RIRA would have had a lot of cars which might be for special jobs &rdquo;like bank robberies&ldquo; but would not be for bombings. If there was any indication whatsoever that the stolen car was going to Northern Ireland or across to Britain, the Garda&iacute; would be on to the RUC or the British police straightaway.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0">One must bear in mind, however, that the Provisional IRA had been on &rsquo;resumed&rsquo; ceasefire since 20 July 1997, and in October 1997, following a general army convention, republican dissidents had withdrawn to establish the Real IRA. One must also bear in mind that the Garda informant was told by his contact that &ldquo;the boys are back in business&rdquo;, sometime in mid-January 1998. According to the report:</P>
    <P LI="1">Much of the information provided by the Detective Sergeant and his informant in 1998 was sensitive and valuable and, together with a great deal of other valuable and sensitive intelligence, was received at a critical period in the establishment of the RIRA.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Another point to bear in mind is that the first action subsequently attributed to the Real IRA was on 6 January 1998, and was an attempted car bomb. Of the 28 incidents attributed by the report to the Real IRA, not a single one was a bank robbery or even closely resembled a bank robbery.</P>
    <P>A second example exists. In regard to the theft of a Mazda motor car, the detective sergeant claimed that the Real IRA contact told the informant that the car might or would be used in a mortar attack and that he &mdash; the detective &mdash; then passed this information on to his superiors. This was denied and it was claimed in rebuttal that an individual such as the Real IRA contact would not tell a car thief what use the Real IRA would make of a stolen car. This assertion was accepted by the inquiry team.</P>
    <P>However, in regard to another stolen car, a Punto, the Real IRA man told the car thief that it was to be burnt outside someone&rsquo;s house as a warning. The car thief and the detective disbelieved this and, according to the detective, he informed his superiors that it would probably be used in a mortar attack.</P>
    <P>His superiors insist that the only information they had regarding the Punto was that it was to be burnt out. In this case, the previous contention that the Real IRA would never reveal the purpose to which a stolen car would be put is ignored, perhaps because it suited the official position. The inquiry team never raised this apparent contradiction.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Punto, the detective claimed, as I said, that he informed his superiors the car might be used in a mortar attack. According to <Col N="1049"/>him, his superiors, concerned about protecting the informant, were of the belief that &ldquo;it was unlikely that any loss of life would result from such an attack&rdquo; and decided to let the car through.</P>
    <P>The response from the detective&rsquo;s superior was:</P>
    <P LI="1">It was the most insulting thing that anybody could say to him that he would let something go through because it would involve only a mortar attack and only material damage would be likely to be caused because, given his experience he would know well that a home-made rocket is unpredictable and a most lethal and dangerous thing.</P>
    <P FLI="0">To support this case, an inventory of Provisional IRA and Real IRA mortar attacks since 1986 is included in the report. However, the only conclusion from this inventory is that mortars were a lethal weapon in the hands of the Provisional IRA, but not in the hands of the Real IRA.</P>
    <P>Six individual Real IRA mortar attacks were reported, but no casualties were reported in any attack. In addition, the failure rate of these mortars was very high. On 10 March 1998, two out of five mortars failed to explode. In regard to the attacks of 24 March 1998 in Forkhill and Armagh no details were provided of how many failed to explode. In the next three Real IRA mortar attacks the device failed to function in each case. However, since the details about mortar attacks are apparently included in the report to bolster the official line, the high rate of failure in Real IRA mortar attacks is not alluded to.</P>
    <P>Time and again in the report, reference is made to excellent co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda. The report states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Group has been very impressed by the strength of the opinions expressed to it by a serving and three retired senior officers of the RUC/PSNI when they emphasised the total co-operation ... and the degree of trust which had developed between the two police forces.</P>
    <P FLI="0">However, elsewhere in the report we are informed that the PSNI Omagh team identified a link between earlier events in 1998, referred to by the detective sergeant in his intelligence reports, and the Omagh bombing. The official line is that the Garda was not aware of any intelligence identifying such a link. What does this discrepancy reveal about the degree of co-operation? The Garda authorities were not asked about this contradiction.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to co-operation, in at least two instances senior Garda officers were quoted as stating that, despite the lack of a paper record, they would have informed RUC counterparts of events such as, for example, burnt out cars being found. The relevant RUC officers cannot specifically recall being informed of these events but stated that if their Garda counterparts said <Col N="1050"/>so, it must have happened. I do not query that, but no records appear to exist to buttress it.</P>
    <P>Despite the absence of a paper record and the clear failure of the RUC to recall information being passed to it, the inquiry team accepted this as being the case. On the other hand, the disaffected detective sergeant was not at any stage afforded such a benefit of the doubt by the inquiry team.</P>
    <P>The report quoted the PSNI Omagh inquiry team as identifying individuals linked to the informant as being connected with the construction of the Omagh car bomb. However, senior garda&iacute;, aware of all Garda and PSNI intelligence on Omagh, said they never received any &ldquo;even remotely similar&rdquo; intelligence. They said the informant was a car thief and &ldquo;not connected to any persons connected to the construction of the car bomb.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To prove an entirely different point, this time in favour of the senior officers rather than the disaffected detective sergeant, the report quoted the Garda as having passed on to the PSNI an intelligence report received from the detective. This was to the effect that when the Real IRA contact learned of the arrest of a car thief who had previously been connected with the informant, and thereby with him, &ldquo;he was so concerned that he might talk that he arranged to meet the car thief&rsquo;s father the next day and warned him that if he found out that his son had talked about the explosives part of things he would have him shot&rdquo;. I am not clear how that passage is easily reconciled with the assertion that the informant was &ldquo;not connected to any persons connected to the construction of the car bomb&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point crystal clear, I am in no way persuaded of the truth of any of the detective sergeant&rsquo;s allegations, let alone of all of them, and, needless to say, the report of the Nally group does nothing to promote his case. However, I repeat what I said on the last occasion we discussed this matter and earlier in these remarks. It was possible for the ombudsman in Northern Ireland to provide the families most affected by the Omagh tragedy with a considerable amount of information. I strongly believe that the Government must find a way to provide the families with as much information as is possible without compromising the undoubtedly valid arguments the Minister has relating to sensitive security material. I welcome the remarks the Minister made, if I interpret them correctly, in saying that once contemplated litigation is disposed of he may be in a position to make available to the relatives a redacted version of the report. That would be very helpful.</P>

	<P>In addressing the Nally report and the Omagh bombing of 1998, our first thoughts must be with the victims, the survivors and the bereaved of that terrible atrocity. On my behalf and on behalf of my party, I again express our deepest sympathy and condolences to the Omagh families and to all those affected by the bombing. Sinn F&eacute;in said at the time, and will continue to say, that the Omagh bombing was an atrocity carried out by people whose objective was to destroy the peace process and the republican peace strategy. It was the action of a tiny splinter group that set its face against the political path endorsed by genuine republicans throughout Ireland. It had nothing to do with Irish republicanism and it set back the cause its perpetrators claimed to serve.</P>
    <P>When statements were taken in the D&aacute;il on the Nally report on 16 December last, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out that it was unsatisfactory that some parties and Independent Deputies were being asked to make statements on a report they had not seen. Some Opposition leaders, Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, were given sight of the report but others, including my party, were denied this access. This has not been rectified in the intervening period. At that time we called for the publication of the report, but that has not happened either. Therefore, we are relying on the statements of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 16 December and today for our information on the report. This is unsatisfactory. I will leave it at that as I do not wish to make a party political issue of this matter.</P>
    <P>In her report on the Omagh tragedy the Police Ombudsman in the Six Counties, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, called for a review of the role and function of the RUC special branch, now of course incorporated in the PSNI. According to the Minister on 16 December, the Nally report called for &ldquo;a written code of instructions and guidelines on intelligence gathering and agent handling&rdquo;. The report said that action has been taken on this but it should be reviewed. Nally also recommended: &ldquo;consideration should be given to whether legislation covering intelligence gathering and agent handling would be desirable&rdquo;. These recommendations are what could be called spin-offs from the main body of the report which, we are told, finds no foundation for the allegations it examined against garda&iacute; regarding Omagh. Nonetheless, they are recommendations which should be taken seriously and acted upon.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the career of the best known British agent in the Six Counties, Brian Nelson, to see the extent to which such agents played a key role in facilitating State violence against citizens. Nelson&rsquo;s British intelligence handlers used him to target many people for assassination, including human rights lawyer Pat Finucane. Everything was done to prevent exposing Nelson as a British agent. When he was exposed, all further avenues of inquiry were closed off. This is the familiar pattern in the use <Col N="1052"/>of agents by State forces in counter-insurgencies throughout the world. They are used as agents for State crimes at every level, often by ambitious police and military officers to further their personal careers, regardless of the cost in lives.</P>
    <P>The British Government has suppressed a whole series of reports from Stalker-Sampson to Stevens and to the current report by Judge Cory because they threaten to expose its full complicity in State terror in Ireland. Publishing the Nally report would not only meet the wishes of the Omagh relatives, but would also strengthen the hand of the Government in calling on the British Government to publish its suppressed reports.</P>
    <P>I again extend sympathy to all those affected by the Omagh bombing. I hope that, with all the deceased, the bereaved and the survivors of the conflict in our country, whether civilian or combatant, on all sides, their vindication will be a successful process of conflict resolution and the establishment, finally, of lasting and just peace in our country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in an impossible position in debating a report that I have not seen. How can we pass judgment by any reasonable standard on a report the Government is insisting on keeping secret? Much less are we in a position to pass judgment on the allegations made against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or elements of it, that it in some way facilitated or made the Omagh bombing possible. This was the reason for the report in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that elected Members of the D&aacute;il, the people in this State and especially the bereaved and the survivors of the Omagh atrocity are expected to take the word of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there is no substance to the allegations. In turn, the Minister has repeated what the three person team concluded. We need to be able to independently form judgments on the conclusions and the reasons those conclusions were reached. We need to be able to get behind the conclusions to determine if we agree with them. This is surely a basic demand.</P>
    <P>The Government should publish the report. If the names of people against whom allegations are made that cannot be proved must be deleted, then so be it. The relatives of those killed and maimed in Omagh have demanded that the report be published. This should be honoured. A process of investigation behind closed doors is inadequate and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Has the Government not learned anything from the 30 year traumatic aftermath of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings? The victims of those bombings, and the relatives of those killed, have had a 30 year odyssey in trying to bring out the truth of what happened and make some sense of what was a senseless atrocity. Is another group of relatives and injured survivors to be put through a similar odyssey? There must be an open and public inquiry into what happened and then people can make their judgments.</P><Col N="1053"/>
    <P>The Omagh bombing of 15 August 1998 was an outrageous atrocity. As usual, the victims were ordinary working men, women and children. The Omagh bomb demonstrated yet again the utterly reactionary nature of paramilitarism, whether Real IRA, Provisional IRA or loyalist paramilitary. These self-appointed organisations had no mandate for the atrocities carried out in the course of decades in Northern Ireland. Of course, the British establishment, and British imperialism, were the creators of the sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland. Therefore, the solution to sectarianism does not rest with the British establishment or the conservative political establishment of this Republic.</P>
    <P>Sectarian divisions have been deepened by the actions of all paramilitaries, whether they are republican or loyalist. Unfortunately, the political structures imposed on Northern Ireland represent an institutionalisation of those sectarian divisions. The unity of working-class people, Protestant and Catholic, in pursuit of a society in which social and economic ills can be resolved with democratic socialist policies is the basis for a solution. It is in the process of achieving a united working class that the paramilitaries and those who seek to divide the people further will be cast aside.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is well aware of the atmosphere of hurt, anger and disillusionment that persists among relatives of the Omagh atrocity&rsquo;s victims. Their feelings are directed in the first instance towards the investigating authorities that have so far failed to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators and provide ongoing information on the how and why of that appalling day in Omagh. The Minister must be especially aware that, in the second instance, that hurt, anger and disillusionment is directed at the political authorities of the British and Irish Governments. That was most pertinently shown by the less than effusive welcome the Taoiseach received in Omagh yesterday.</P>
    <P>In view of that ongoing hurt, anger and disillusionment, the Minister&rsquo;s response today, given the legal constraints within which he operates, will do nothing to lessen those feelings among the Omagh relatives. As has been stated by other speakers, this debate is occurring in something of a vacuum, although it must be accepted that the Minister has offered private grief briefings and given some indication of his <Col N="1054"/>situation. However, by not physically presenting the report &mdash; perhaps truncated &mdash; to those who must examine it, especially relatives of the Omagh victims, we cannot clearly say what right or wrong has been served by this group meeting and producing a report.</P>
    <P>Also of concern is the Minister&rsquo;s implication, which I picked up from what he said today and which he might care to refute in his response to this debate, that the right of the Omagh relatives to know compromises or undermines the national security of this State. If that is the weighing-up exercise being done, the implication is unfortunate. I would like it spelt out later in this debate to what extent such a compromising or undermining of this State&rsquo;s security will be occasioned by physically showing the relatives what information is available.</P>
    <P>The second implication, on which the Minister should be really forthright, is that somehow the issue is the conflict between the opinion of one person, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, and that of the three eminent people who comprised the Nally group. That is unfair, since we know that Ms O&rsquo;Loan has her own reputation which the Government has chosen to use regarding our ongoing work in ensuring acceptable policing in Northern Ireland. She is also the head of an agency with its own investigative back-up which is independent of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. To apply that type of weighting and say that it is one person against three or that we are giving more weight to those who happen to be our three people would be an unfortunate implication to emerge from this debate. It would further undermine the confidence of the Omagh relatives in the entire process.</P>
    <P>After today, there must be some type of commitment, which the Minister has partially given, that, outside the constraints in which he finds himself regarding the individual referenced in the report and whatever criminal proceedings are being followed, a report will be published. The Minister has talked about that possibility. I would like a firm commitment that it will be done as quickly as possible and include the maximum amount of detail that can be given to help what is most in need of help at this stage, namely, the confidence of the Omagh victims&rsquo; relatives. Until we secure such a commitment, I fear that the hurt, anger and disillusionment that began on that day in August 1998 will only intensify. We in this House should not add to such an atmosphere.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I live in a Border county. Obviously, in many ways living there is no different from living anywhere else. We have had a long history, over many years, of being touched by what has happened in the North. Dead bodies were left in our county. Murder most foul was committed, and that affected the population generally. With the greatest respect, regardless of anything else, the issue here is the relatives of those who died. They are everyone&rsquo;s primary <Col N="1055"/>concern. They should be given the most information as early and as quickly as possible to satisfy them regarding the tragedies that their families and they suffered in that most awful terrorist act.</P>
    <P>I wish to compare two matters. I accept what the Minister said. No one doubts the credibility, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the Garda in all matters relating to this investigation, or that of the RUC in the North. The difference is that, in the North, an investigation has taken place into what transpired in Omagh. Nuala O&rsquo;Loan put on the record in her report exactly what information the RUC had at that time. It is astounding and upsetting to read that report, which is in the public domain.</P>
    <P>The first issue is that, on 4 August 1998, 11 days before the Omagh bombing, a ten minute telephone call took place between an informer and the police station in Omagh informing the latter that a terrorist attack of unspecified nature would take place on the police station on 11 August. Three days before the bombing further information was received about unspecified attacks somewhere in the North of Ireland. Nuala O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s report states that the information was not passed up the line in the RUC. That is clearly a damning indictment of the procedures and situation in the RUC at that time. Her recommendations are clear about the changes that will have to take place in the PSNI as a result of this information. The awful fact is that, if only that had been acted on and more attention paid to it or the officers who subsequently interviewed an informer had acted differently, believing that the so-called smuggler was a well-known dissident republican, things might have been different. However, ultimately the bombing took place and the mayhem and terror happened. That is what we must deal with.</P>
    <P>Nobody doubts the integrity of the Minister or of the argument that he makes from his perspective. Neither does anyone doubt that the relatives do not accept his view of what should happen now. In the House today, we wish to move the matter on in the best and most constructive way possible. My leader, Deputy Kenny, has made the most constructive suggestion of all. He is calling for someone of international repute with a background in judicial affairs. As in the case of other investigations, the person would have truly international standing and take ownership of this issue on all our behalf. That ownership would be in the context of giving the relatives as many facts as can be given. How does that differ from what the Minister says? The Minister says that there are issues of State security. Of course there are and, as Deputy Kenny has said, no one wants any such information released. Neither do the relatives want it. However, the report also included information that the relatives could and must have. This is a clear and obvious way of dealing with the issue.</P><Col N="1056"/>
    <P>The person would deal initially with the relatives. Provided he or she has sufficient international standing, there is no reason he or she could not be given the report and, if the Minister feels he cannot do so, seek a way to communicate some facts and details to the families. They want transparency and openness and an independent inquiry should be able to establish more information which could be given to the relatives.</P>
    <P>We have had many inquires north and south of the Border and many more have been called for which have not taken place. The Omagh bombing was the worst single atrocity north or south of the Border and it behoves us to re-examine all available information and consider what we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to meet the relatives again and to do the best he can. He must go the extra mile for them. Even if he has three arguments for not holding an inquiry, he needs only one reason to proceed, as I would, to take the step and reach out because the relatives need and are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Nuala O&rsquo;Loan has been fantastic in her investigation in the North into how the RUC operated on the day of the bombings. She has placed in the public domain her criticisms and the changes required. Having made every possible effort to ensure the Government has available to it all the information she had, Ms O&rsquo;Loan is entitled to a copy of the report. The Minister stated she is not an officer of this State, which is correct, but she is an Irish person acting in a part of this country in an independent and professional capacity. Her independence and integrity have not been challenged by the Minister or anybody else. Why not give her a copy of the report and allow her to see the results of the investigation conducted here on foot of the information she provided?</P>
    <P>The Nally report recommends that the matter be progressed and refers to keeping better records of North-South contacts and exchanges in intelligence, and establishing a written code of instructions and guidelines on intelligence gathering and agent handling. Obviously, I am not aware of the reason the report recommends even these changes, but it clearly contains more information than that in the public domain and we are entitled to know what it is without compromising the integrity, security or identity of any named person or officer.</P>
    <P>The least to which we are entitled is to have as much as possible of the report released but we are also entitled to the greatest possible degree of transparency and clearly the relatives are deeply unhappy with the current position in this regard. I urge the Minister to go the extra mile and reach out to those who have suffered most at the hands of awful people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and offer my sympathy and condolences to the survivors and the relatives of <Col N="1057"/>the victims of the most serious atrocity to take place in Northern Ireland in the course of the troubles of recent decades. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, will agree, it is ironic that the House, through a sub-committee, is currently dealing with the Barron report on the most serious atrocity ever to take place in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the Nally report. It is unsatisfactory that a party spokesperson on justice should not be given a copy of it and that it should be made available to only two party leaders. This level of non-disclosure raises a major question mark about the report&rsquo;s value, particularly given that the Minister has informed the House that no further disclosure will be made until such time as the court hearing takes place in the case of the prime participants who feature in the report. The Minister must reassess this approach and consider the possibility of returning with some form of redacted report. The House should not forget that the report before the sub-committee hearings on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings redacted but the sub-committee has still been able to perform its function in recent months.</P>
    <P>This is the reason for the considerable dissatisfaction among the relatives and survivors which was evident yesterday in the manner in which the Taoiseach was treated. Clearly, the perception among them is that they are not receiving a fair hearing from the powers that be and this resonates among the relatives and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings who have felt for years that those in power did not want to effect a resolution or deal seriously with their troubles, grief and problems. I hope we do not arrive at a position in which the same sense of grief, frustration and anger is reflected among the relatives and survivors of the Omagh bombing in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s suggestion that the Minister consider establishing a Cory-like inquiry or investigation has some merit. The downside of his proposal, however, is that it would still be a private investigation and we would end up with material which is not amenable to public disclosure in any form. Nevertheless, that approach has merit as a step forward.</P>
    <P>As the Acting Chairman is aware, the sub-committee on the Barron report has been engaged in its role for a considerable period. The sub-committee could provide a public forum, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, for the relatives and survivors of the Omagh bombings to tell their story. One of the major grievances is that nobody has heard the story told by survivors and relatives themselves and that there is no public forum for them to do so.</P>
    <P>We could also invite the Nally group to attend the sub-committee. Its members, a former Secretary of the Department of Justice, a former Director of Public Prosecutions and a former Secretary to the Government, are all senior experienced figures who know the ropes. It would <Col N="1058"/>be valuable if they were to attend the sub-committee to explain the methodology they used and the lengths to which they went to elicit information within their terms of reference. The sub-committee could then question them on the issue because some serious questions have been raised by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we could also invite the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, before the sub-committee. Is there a good reason that the ombudsman, who raised this issue in the first instance with the Minster for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and has taken considerable interest in the matter, should not come before a sub-committee of the House to find out how far we can advance the issue?</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is a format or formula to enable us to progress the matter. The worst course of action would be to allow word to go out again that, having conducted an inquiry, we have information in a report but it will remain on a shelf and will be treated in the most exclusive and secretive fashion of any report to this House.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Two Members of the Oireachtas, apart from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have been given copies of the report. It is ridiculous in terms of investigation or reportage if it has to be left at that. I suggest that would be a reasonable avenue to be explored by the Minister and I welcome his response to that suggestion. The House could go further and look for statements and written submissions from anybody who might wish to provide them.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the Nally report highlights the need for an ombudsman. The three gentlemen who compiled this report had no investigating experience. An ombudsman would have people at his or her disposal and would be in a position to conduct a forensic and professional investigation in accordance with the terms of reference. An ombudsman would have the powers, the methodology and the ability to carry out an investigation in a fine fashion and would produce a credible report.</P>
    <P>On the question of informants and how they are to be dealt with, there seems to be a very lackadaisical, <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the matter. There are no guidelines within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the witness protection scheme and Garda informants. It appears they are run on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The Minister is not in a position to give any guidelines or suggestions on the level of Garda scrutiny, monitoring and control of informants. We need to know precisely how a Garda informant is dealt with by the police handler.There is a question about the person responsible for this particular informant and questions about the bona fides of the informant, but who knows other than the person who is the immediate handler. There are serious issues of this nature coming to light.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that we should find ways of moving forward and the <Col N="1059"/>suggestion made by Deputy Kenny and me might be usefully explored.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this particularly sad and emotive issue. Like other speakers, I wish to record my sympathies to those who survived the blast and the relatives of those who died. It was a truly horrific act perpetrated on a people going about their ordinary business in the middle of the summer, during the course of the summer holidays, many of whom were from all parts of the country, of all races, creeds and nationalities, who were unlucky enough to be in what somebody else deemed to be the wrong place at the wrong time. Nothing can ever excuse the dastardly deed done to them on that day.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and to the speeches of the leader of my party, Deputy Kenny, and the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, both of whom have had sight of the report. Like other speakers, I believe the integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is recognised and must be recognised otherwise we have a serious problem. Likewise, I have no difficulty recognising the integrity of the Nally report. From what I can gather and from the distance from whence I am viewing it, the report has done the best it can do in the circumstances. However, there are a number of issues that still remain outstanding. The Minister, Members on this side of the House and I understand that these issues are of concern to the relatives. They are concerned about rumours which have played a great role in the history of this country and they will play an equally prominent role in the future of this country.</P>
    <P>Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan was obviously aware of some of the circumstances and a report was made to her by the person who made the complaint &mdash; the Garda who is now under suspension. She has produced a report. The Minister pointed out twice in his reply that she is not an officer of this jurisdiction. I do not believe that is relevant. If a person of integrity produces a report within or without the jurisdiction, it should be fully investigated. I hope the Minister will clarify that matter because that was not the impression given in his speech to the House.</P>
    <P>The matter of the detective sergeant who is under investigation is of concern. I presume he was under investigation before these issues arose and that in the course of it, he countered by raising his own counter-statements. That does not necessarily mean that he is wrong and that is a cause for concern. He obviously wishes to defend himself and he will draw whatever evidence he can to support his case. The Minister is better informed than I am because he has the access. Much will depend on the degree of detail that the person had, the amount of information he supplied and whether or not there are a number of coincidences. They may be coincidences or they may be something more serious.</P><Col N="1060"/>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the person on the witness protection programme. The Minister stated in his speech that the person was legally advised not to co-operate and not to give information. It is obvious that is what he would do and that would be the normal thing to do in those circumstances. I am concerned that there might be wider implications and I question why that advice was given. The person concerned is on the witness protection programme and, as Deputy Kenny pointed out this morning, several other people who have been on that programme have come forward and given evidence which has been used to good effect. I hope the Minister will clarify the matter further in his reply or in the course of the report, abridged or otherwise, which he intends to make available to the relatives and, hopefully, to the House at some later stage.</P>
    <P>From the information I have gleaned from the public arena, from the Minister&rsquo;s speech and from the speeches of the two Opposition parties&rsquo; leaders who have had sight of the report, there would appear to be a number of unanswered questions that remain to be dealt with, apart from attempting to assuage the concerns of the relatives. It is necessary to ensure that not only is justice done and seen to be done. It must continue in the future and the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to that is sacrosanct. I am not critical of what has happened to date but what happens from here on needs to take on some kind of new hue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the O&rsquo;Loan report would appear to be significant and to have a major impact on the issue. The failure of the witness on the witness protection programme to make a statement, to co-operate or to be interviewed in connection with the Nally report, is more serious. I do not know how the Minister can achieve that without a further examination or report.</P>
    <P>It cannot go on forever, it must reach closure at some stage. It would be wrong if we were to allow the opportunity to pass without clearly setting out that the House and the Minister mean business. There can be no refuge for people who get involved in the perpetration of such acts, now or in the future. It is fine to produce rhetoric, but our actions that result from what has happened will have a lasting effect.</P>
    <P>We have all heard rumours about where and when the bomb was sourced etc. We have acquired most of our information through rumour. The Minister may have more information about it than we have &mdash; he should have more information at this stage. There can be no doubt about what the Minister&rsquo;s reaction will have to be at some stage &mdash; there will have to be some retribution and somebody will have to be charged. If no such action is taken on foot of all the information that is in the public arena, the system can be said to be beginning to waver.</P>

	<P>According to an order of this House of yesterday, questions can now be taken <Col N="1061"/>for a period not exceeding 20 minutes. I remind Members that this debate will end at 12.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to ask the Minister some questions. I do not have access to all the information that is available to the Minister. A 300-page statement was made by the detective sergeant who made these allegations in the first instance. Two further reports have been produced by the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Why have the families of the victims never been interviewed about this matter? They can give evidence to me or anybody else about a man and a woman who entered shops in Omagh, on several separate occasions some time before the atrocity, to ask shopkeepers and persons who lost loved ones questions about how long one can park a car on the street without it being moved. None of these people was ever spoken to by the Nally group.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on the witness protection programme. I have spoken before of certain instances relating to the Gilligan trial. If the conditions of the programme, which I understand has cost over &euro;1 million already, are set by the State and legal advice is given to the informant, I do not see why some mechanism cannot be put in place to receive information provided by that person. I ask the Minister to respond to this suggestion. Does he feel that something similar to the Cory report would be beneficial?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that we will never let up on our investigations. I understand from the PSNI investigative team that a DNA profile can be made available within 72 hours, or within 48 hours if required urgently. I understand that a request was made by the investigative team last June for two DNA profiles, but they have not yet been supplied. If that is the case, it contradicts completely the notion that there is greater co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter. If the PSNI investigative team requested DNA profiles in two particular cases of importance in the ongoing criminal investigation, but did not receive them, surely the claim that there is greater co-operation is contradicted. Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform happy that the level of co-operation that is supposed to exist between the PSNI and the Garda exists? There appears to be contradictory evidence in that regard. I would like to think that the Minister and his counterpart will ensure that information flows freely between each side.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the gravity of the Minister&rsquo;s comment this morning that the group which perpetrated the Omagh slaughter &ldquo;plans to strike again&rdquo;. The Minister can be assured that his efforts to ensure that the security of citizens, North and South, is protected will receive the wholehearted support of this side of the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to correct the impression that was given earlier in the debate that I have not met the Omagh relatives&rsquo; group. I spent two and a half hours with the group at a meeting in my Department. The group&rsquo;s anger and frustration, caused by various things, were fully and frankly ventilated at the lengthy meeting. The impression that I did not meet the group seems to have got out, but I met them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That was before the report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it was before the report. I indicated to them that I will meet them again, after I have dealt adequately with the Nally report in this House. We did not have much time to discuss the matter before Christmas so I suggested that we have another debate, which is taking place today. I will meet the group again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate, as doubt seems to be creeping in already, that as soon as the criminal prosecution is out of the way, regardless of what happens in that regard, I will set my mind to producing as much as I can of the Nally report in a form in which it can be read by the public. I will explain this to the relatives when I meet them.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons, why in effect, I am &ldquo;between a rock and a hard place&rdquo;, as I said earlier. The first reason relates to the criminal proceedings which are in train. A good deal of the Nally report centres on the motivation and credibility of a person against whom serious charges are about to be made. I could not place that material in the public domain without saying, in effect, that the criminal proceedings have come to an end. That would have its own implications. The second reason I am &ldquo;between a rock and a hard place&rdquo; relates to the security interest. I will do my best to overcome the considerable and substantial difficulties that exist in that context.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Real IRA and the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, the political adjunct of the Real IRA, are planning, as we speak, to plant another bomb of this type. They have made many efforts to put together bombs of this type and they have been frustrated and thwarted in a number of ways. They have attempted to take many people&rsquo;s lives and they intend to continue trying to do so. My first duty must be to prevent another incident such as that in Omagh in 1998. Therefore, I cannot place in the public domain something which assists the organisations in question in changing their <i>modus operandi</i>, so that they can get away with it the next time. Everybody agrees with me that it should be my first priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked me why the relatives were not interviewed in Northern Ireland about this matter. I have no official function in this regard, but I presume that any relatives with information such as that to which Deputy Kenny <Col N="1063"/>refers are available to the PSNI now. I stress that the file is not closed. If admissible evidence is ever made available which enables the Director of Public Prosecutions or his counterpart in Northern Ireland to prosecute anybody &mdash; somebody who was centrally involved or a person who was peripherally involved &mdash; I do not doubt that there will be a trial. I cannot decide whether evidence is or is not available. It is a decision to be made by independent constitutional officers on either side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked if something analogous to the Cory report would be beneficial. Deputy Costello put his finger on the problem in this regard, which is that the Cory report, just like the Barron report, operates on the basis of an absence of statutory powers. If there are no statutory powers, there is only so far one can go. A method of inquiry &mdash; the tribunal system &mdash; is in place under the 1921 Act and subsequent legislation, but it would be wholly unsuitable for this matter because tribunals are required to operate in public. One could not have a public tribunal dealing with this kind of material. In the near future I hope this House will get on with the commissions of inquiry legislation so there will be alternatives to public tribunals of inquiry. If I asked Judge Cory, Mr. Justice Barron or any other judge to look at what these three men have done, whoever that judge might be would face exactly the same problems they faced as regards the informer who was on a witness protection programme.</P>
    <P>Superficially, one might ask why there should be a problem about getting somebody who is on a witness protection programme to co-operate with the subsequent inquiry. The whole point of a witness protection programme is that that person&rsquo;s anonymity is fully respected, and that his or her privacy and new life are sacrosanct. In this case, I want to make it clear that it is not as if the three people did not make every effort to contact him. They first approached the individual through his legal advisor. He was on the witness protection programme of the State. They put questions to him, via his legal advisor but, despite repeated efforts to elicit replies, they never received any. They were told on more than one occasion by his legal advisor that he was not prepared to reply to questions but it was held out to them that he might be prepared to do so at some time in the future. They also requested through the legal advisor, an interview with the informant but that was refused. They concluded and stated that it is deeply regrettable that they should have to report without having had replies to those questions. The implication has gone out that somehow they said, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re indifferent to that issue&rdquo;, but it is quite the reverse. They regarded what happened as deeply regrettable but they were not in a position to punch through the witness protection programme and somehow summon this person before them and examine him on the issues that arose. Neither <Col N="1064"/>Judge Cory, Mr. Justice Barron nor anybody else would be in a position to do that, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that some things were used to bolster the official line. I know that may just be a turn of phrase, but I certainly repudiate the suggestion that there was an official line of the Irish State and that these three men hunted for material to bolster the official line. If I thought for one minute that the allegations that were made were true or had a really substantial element of truth in them, I would act immediately to deal with this issue.</P>

	<P>What about the DNA?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unaware of the particular requests that have been made regarding DNA, but I cannot imagine that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is refusing to hand over DNA samples to people in Northern Ireland. I was at a meeting earlier this week, and the degree of co-operation, trust and mutual confidence between both police forces is at an all-time high; it is very close.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as it is possible, our first responsibility should be to the survivors and relatives of the victims of the Omagh bombing. We know how frustrated they are from events, even as recent as those of yesterday. Will the Minister re-examine the documentation in the Nally report and provide an extensive briefing &mdash; not a general briefing, as he has suggested &mdash; in addition to a document that would reflect what took place in the substance of the Nally report?</P>
    <P>I have suggested that we should provide a forum in this House for the relatives of the victims and the survivors to tell their stories. It took us 30 years to provide such a forum for the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. A forum, such as I have suggested, could also invite the Northern Ireland ombudsman to attend. Since she has made a public statement in Northern Ireland about the Omagh bombing, there is no reason it cannot be stated before a committee of this House. We should also invite the Nally group to inquire about its methodology in dealing with the terms of reference and its conclusions. That would be a mechanism for moving the matter on, which would be in the public arena and would not interfere with the matters to which the Minister has referred, which could not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns the PSNI and the RUC. If there was no record of the contact between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the RUC on the RUC side, and there was no memory of that contact, surely there is a problem of record taking, record keeping and communications. No matter what the Minister says about the goodwill that exists between both forces, if there is no mechanism or structure in place, I do not know where we are going. It harks back to the events <Col N="1065"/>of 30 years ago, about which we have heard the same description of communications.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the time for whatever information is likely to be made available is predicated on the imminent criminal proceedings, have the Minister or his Department made any general inquiries to the Courts Service as to when a case would be heard, for how long it is anticipated to run, and what likely appeal process would follow? Are we talking about a process of six months or two years?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not direct the Courts Service or find out from the Courts Service what happens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Not directly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is litigation involving the DPP and I do not want to comment on it. I understand it has been adjourned on a number of occasions and that it will be dealt with. It is not in the blue yonder, it will be dealt with in the relatively near future.</P>
    <P>As regards the keeping of records, the Garda Commissioner has assured me that the recommendations of the Nally group have been acted upon. I would not like anybody to think it has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>In the context of dealing with informers, I want to say one thing that I think is of some significance. It was suggested by Deputy Ferris that somehow the use of informers is wrong in principle, but his view is wholly wrong in itself. The biggest damage that has been done to the organisation that perpetrated the Omagh bombing was a major criminal trial in which an informer &mdash; an American man &mdash; penetrated it and informed on it. When one is dealing with cruel and vicious people who will go to any lengths to kill others, it is proper, subject to proper safeguards, for that kind of evidence to be used. If one was to exclude all inside information, both for intelligence purposes and ultimately, on occasion, for trials, the alternative would be to say simply that the rule of law was completely helpless in the face of highly disciplined conspiracies, such as those with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello asked whether a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, of which he is a member, should offer a forum. I have no principled objection to that but it is a matter for the committee. I see that the chairman of that committee is Acting Chairman here today. The practicality of doing that should be discussed by the members of that committee, which is hugely overburdened. I recognise, however, what <Col N="1066"/>Deputy Costello and a number of other Deputies have said. They do not want to act in an off-hand manner towards people who have been subjected to these terrible things. I will play any constructive part I can in addressing the sense of grievance, hurt and unresolved wondering as to precisely how all this took place.</P>
    <P>Members mentioned the inadequacies or otherwise of the investigation, as found by Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. However, while that may be the case and mistakes may have been made, let us not forget that the primary moral liability lies with those who constructed and placed that bomb, who were absolutely reckless as to the outcome of their actions and who have 31 murder victims on their hands. That is where the responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that these people are trying to carry out similar operations. They have been foiled on a number of occasions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done a fantastic job, as has the PSNI, in stopping the carrying out of such operations. A massive car bomb was found entering Derry which had been assembled in County Donegal by the same organisation with which we are dealing in this case. Our primary concern must be to face down these people and defeat them, rather than to give them succour by saying that, somehow, there is fault on the part of the State, which is engaged in a life and death struggle with them. It is wrong that such matters should come back to haunt the State rather than the people who are doing this at present, and who must be confronted and prevented.</P>

   <Title>Tribunals of Inquiry: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The third interim report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was published on 21 January 2004. Its findings relate to Mr. George Redmond and its publication was delayed as Mr. Redmond, who is the primary subject of the report, was before the courts facing charges for corruption.</P>
    <P>Mr. Redmond was the assistant city and county manager for Dublin. The report describes in detail three payments made to Mr. Redmond. Of those, the report concludes that two were corrupt payments and the other did not fall within the definition of a corrupt payment as provided for in the interpretation of the tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference. The report found that the persons who made the payments were Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr. and Mr. Michael Bailey.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the tribunal has sent out a very clear message to anyone who has corrupt dealings relating to planning that these matters can no longer be kept secret. This message is reinforced by the clear findings in the second and third interim reports of Mr. Justice Flood. The Government fully supports this and is providing the tribunal with the resources it requires to continue with work set out in its terms of <Col N="1067"/>reference so that the matters being investigated by the tribunal can be resolved once and for all.</P>
    <P>Corruption and the act of hindering or obstructing a tribunal are criminal offences and the law in this regard must be enforced. It is unacceptable for any person who holds high office to accept corrupt payments in return for favours. It is important that legislation and structures are in place to ensure that decisions taken by personnel in public office, which can confer large financial benefit on others, are taken in a transparent way. Over the past few years the Government has been actively working to ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <P>As yet, the tribunal has not made specific recommendations in regard to amendments to planning, local government or ethics in public office legislation. However, while much important work remains to be completed by the tribunal, the Government has initiated some ongoing improvements of planning and ethics law. The Government made a series of significant changes to planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act 2000. We introduced more opportunities for public consultation and scrutiny at both development plan and permission level.</P>
    <P>It is notable that, in the conclusion to the report, one payment referred to was connected to the non-application of development charges that are normally imposed as a condition of a grant of planning permission. The law has been updated and radically revised in the Planning and Development Act 2000. Contrary to the rhetoric of some Members opposite in recent debates, these revisions will improve the transparency of the system and ensure that it applies openly and fairly across all developments. It takes decisions away from the level of individual applicants and sets a common standard.</P>
    <P>The new system of development contribution schemes gives the job of deciding on a scheme of contributions to the elected members in each planning authority. The officials of the authority must then apply the scheme across all developments. All local authorities have adopted or are in the process of adopting a development contribution scheme to comply with the statutory deadline of 10 March 2004.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes to development contributions over recent years, my Department has been intervening more proactively with planning policy advice and has issued guidelines on matters such as increasing residential densities, mobile phone masts and child care. Draft guidelines on quarries, architectural heritage and landscape have been issued for public consultation. The purpose of these guidelines on specific subjects is to assist local authorities in carrying out their planning function and to give all involved in the planning system up-to-date guidance on best practice.</P>
    <P>Modern guidelines for development management and control, which were last issued in 1982, are being prepared and will be published <Col N="1068"/>later this year. These guidelines will give general guidance to planning authorities on processing planning applications and the content of permissions. Planning authorities have the difficult job of promoting the development of their areas at a strategic level, while handling tens of thousands of different applications for planning permission for individual developments every year. The guidelines issued by the Department will help planning authorities to remove inconsistencies regarding how applications are managed, as well as applying a more consistent national framework by which to measure their performance.</P>
    <P>As well as changes to the planning code, there have been significant developments in recent years in the legislative and regulatory framework governing the conduct of public representatives and public servants. These changes will reinforce public confidence in the standards by which Ireland is governed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to point out, in so far as local government is concerned, that the Local Government Act 2001 provides a comprehensive ethics framework for local government employees and councillors. From January 2003 this has applied to all local authorities. This new framework updated and developed the previous law taking account of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995. As its starting principle, the Act provides that it is the duty of every councillor and employee to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.</P>
    <P>The framework is based on three basic requirements: first, an annual declaration of a wide range of interests; second, disclosure of any interest in a matter coming before the authority; and, third, a public register of these interests. The interests that have to be declared annually by councillors and specified staff include such matters as shareholdings, directorships, holdings of land or other property, gifts, supplies of property or services, travel facilities, contracts with a local authority and certain other matters.</P>
    <P>There is also a requirement to disclose interests in any matter which arises in the performance of functions by the local authority and in which the councillor or employee concerned or a connected person has an interest. A councillor cannot speak or vote in such cases and an employee must comply with directions from his or her manager. Where the matter relates to a manager, she or he must delegate the function. Failure to comply with either requirement is an offence and the penalties have been set at a high level to deter anyone from pursuing this course. The penalties are a fine of a maximum of &euro;12,690 and a term of imprisonment of two years on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>The final elements of this framework, separate draft national codes of conduct for councillors and employees, have been drafted. The codes&rsquo; aims are to set out the standards and principles of conduct and integrity for local authority <Col N="1069"/>employees and councillors, to inform the public of the conduct it is entitled to expect and to uphold public confidence. These draft codes have been made available to interested parties for their views and it is intended, following consideration of those, to have them in place by the middle of 2004. The intention is that the codes will supplement the specific requirements under the Act, and will form an integral part of the new ethics framework. Both the courts and the Standards in Public Office Commission may have regard to them in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>The 2001 Local Government Act is bolstered by other legislation covering the public service such as the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. This legislation strengthened the law on corruption. It provides for a presumption of corruption where there is proof that certain persons in public office have received money or other benefits from a person who has an interest in the way certain functions are carried out or the outcome of certain decisions. In effect, a person who receives a payment in these circumstances will have to prove the payment is not corrupt, instead of the prosecution proving that it was. This should make the prosecution of corrupt payments easier. The types of decision covered by this legislation specifically include the sale or purchase of property and decisions on planning matters.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Act 2001 provided for the establishment of the new Standards in Public Office Commission with wide investigative powers. The commission is a permanent statutory body set up to monitor, investigate and regulate the conduct of those elected to serve the people or who are employed in the public service. This is to ensure the maintenance of proper ethical standards. The Act imposes on politicians and others an obligation to have their tax affairs in order and to swear a statutory declaration that this is so. The commission, in carrying out its functions, can also have regard to a person&rsquo;s compliance with the local government code of conduct. An independent and powerful body such as the Standards in Public Office Commission with an ongoing mandate to supervise and maintain proper ethical standards is the best guarantee that what has happened in the past will not be permitted in the future.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs a planning system that delivers a better quality of life for all. Hard decisions will always have to taken on where and how the country is developed. The best way to get the right decisions that encourage sustainable development is to ensure that they are made in a way that is open and transparent and can be measured against the right standards. The changes the Government has introduced into the planning code will ensure that decisions on development will benefit not just a few individuals but all the people of the State, now and in the future.</P><Col N="1070"/>
    <P>The Government welcomes the third interim report of the tribunal and the clear message it sends out to all persons who engage in corrupt practices. The tribunal has shown that wrongdoing will be exposed. The legislation already enacted and proposed by the Government ensures that we now have anti-corruption legislation appropriate to a modern democracy, with strong monitoring, reporting and enforcement mechanisms. We will not hesitate to respond to any recommendations made by the tribunal to improve our systems further.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Justice Flood is to be congratulated on producing this lucid and conclusive interim report. Any response to a report of this nature must be tempered, especially given the precedent set by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, when her misplaced remarks enabled the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, to evade justice.</P>
    <P>The report details a series of corrupt practices that occurred in the 1980s. It also determines that forenamed persons hindered and obstructed the tribunal&rsquo;s work. This should send out a strong signal that nothing less than full co-operation with the tribunal is acceptable. I expect that the report will be furnished to the Director of Public Prosecutions so that he can take the matter to its conclusion. Will the Minister of State indicate if the DPP has received the report and if any decision been made?</P>
    <P>Despite the costs and the length of time the work of the tribunal takes, this report, as with the previous two interim ones, shows that the tribunal, as a forum for excavating the truth, can deliver. I thank Mr. Justice Flood for his tireless work in bringing to light a litany of corruption that has been a black mark against politics for 20 or more years. It must also be noted that Mr. Justice Flood and the tribunal legal team had to work in the face of stubborn refusals to co-operate with the tribunal from the central people in the investigations. Cutting through the golden circle of givers and takers of bribes was not an easy task and we must be grateful that Mr. Justice Flood, with the help of his team, was able to do that. He has exposed what has turned out to be a culture of corruption in certain quarters throughout the 1980s and quite possibly beyond. It must be determined how deep this went because, if this type of behaviour is tolerated and left unpunished, there is little reason it cannot continue regardless.</P>
    <P>George Redmond received corrupt payments for using his official position to decide on a lower level of service charges and levies being charged to developments on Forrest Road lands. The amount paid was 50% of what would have been payable had Redmond not intervened. A mere 10% of the savings, which was what Redmond had demanded, netted him payments of more than £12,000. These payments were made by Joseph Murphy junior and were a flagrant abuse of an important public official. While one <Col N="1071"/>incident does not make a culture of corruption, it does point to the possibility.</P>
    <P>This is not a victimless crime. We, the people, have to live in the poorly planned areas and make up the shortfalls in taxes. The tribunal has decided that George Redmond received £15,000 from Joseph Murphy junior as compensation for not giving him a consultancy job. This raises the question, for what did Joseph Murphy junior feel the need to compensate George Redmond? What did he owe him for? Further payments of between £16,000 and £20,000 were made by Michael Bailey to George Redmond which the tribunal decided were corrupt. No specific instance was used but the tribunal decided that these payments were made to influence George Redmond in his official capacity.</P>
    <P>The corrupt payments are shocking enough, but equally shocking is that the tribunal found that people hindered and obstructed its work by various means. Not alone have George Redmond, Michael Bailey and Joseph Murphy junior done wrong, they continue to cover up their wrongdoing. This begs the question as to what the tribunal would have uncovered had these men co-operated with it.</P>
    <P>The can of worms is still pretty much closed. There is one person in jail for his behaviour. What is needed now is some kind of sanction against those who hinder, obstruct or fail to co-operate with the tribunal. During the Ray Burke module, several individuals failed to co-operate with the tribunal. Action needs to be taken to let people who are thinking of not fully co-operating with the tribunals know that they will face punishment for such action. If it is not to be legal punishment, then it should be political and social ostracisation.</P>
    <P>This is about protecting the heart of politics, the Civil Service and society in general and we should no longer tolerate the actions, past or present, of the so-called loveable rogues. The glamorising by certain quarters in Fianna F&aacute;il of the actions, in particular of the former Taoiseach Mr. Charles Haughey, must stop. People must realise the damage corruption has done to good planning and development. It must be realised too the potential damage of corruption if left to flourish in dark comers with brown paper bags or their contemporary equivalent.</P>
    <P>We as politicians must send a message to the people that this type of behaviour is not only unacceptable but, more important, it cannot happen again. However, are we sure it cannot happen again? Are there enough checks and balances in political life and for decision makers? Are Ministers who do not give full answers to questions about their decisions sanctioned and exposed? Are people told on what basis the decisions of the day were made, even after five years? Are Deputies who cheat on their taxes expelled from their political parties? Is major legislation debated to a point where the public is aware of the main points and the Opposition feels <Col N="1072"/>that, while possibly disagreeing, it too has had its say? Does the Taoiseach give straight answers to straight questions?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the answer to all these questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The Government tries to suggest that the tribunals are in the past and the occurrences into which they inquire could not possibly happen today. That is the latest spin, on which I heard Fianna F&aacute;il members figures speak on radio and television recently, to the effect that the party is not part of those events. They occurred in prehistoric times and former Deputies Flynn and Burke are dinosaurs who have no connection with the present. They certainly have.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act 1997 was enacted at the time when the revelations about Ray Burke were tearing a hole in the credibility of politics. Everyone welcomed the transparency and accountability the Act would bring to politics. It appeared we had learned the lessons of the past as all parties supported its introduction. What has happened since then is nothing short of a national disgrace. The Freedom of Information Act has been crippled and the sponsoring Ministers for the amending legislation so feared the backlash that they ran away to the races at Cheltenham when it was being passed through the D&aacute;il. Content that the Government&rsquo;s charade of being open had served its purpose to pacify a very angry electorate, it put the amendment through after the 2002 general election. The accountability of this Government is at an all-time low. Its position on so many issues has been fudged to ensure that no one must take responsibility for decisions made on issues such as reductions in community employment schemes, rip-off Ireland, transport gridlock and housing. The Government&rsquo;s responses on these issues are at best ambiguous, at worst, hypocritical. For example, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment promised to tackle spiralling prices while the Minister for Finance was piling on stealth taxes which dominated the inflation figures for 2003.</P>
    <P>The drip feed of supposedly secret documents from the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s next module points to a concerted effort to minimise the impact of the tribunal. It seems likely that certain interests are hoping the public will suffer tribunal fatigue long before the damaging evidence is heard. Every week there is a little more. The Oireachtas set up the tribunals of inquiry on behalf of the people to find out what was going on in the 1980s. One lesson they should have taught us is that the veil of secrecy and the brown envelope go together and if decision makers must give a comprehensive account of their decisions, the brown envelopes become much less influential. Guillotined legislation, Ministers who do not answer questions and a Taoiseach who will not answer straight questions is not good enough, as the Flood tribunal should have taught us.</P>
    <P>For some time there have been elements trying to undermine the workings of the tribunal. If <Col N="1073"/>someone wanted to limit the impact of the issues surrounding the £50,000 cheque and Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s confirmation of the meeting in the D&aacute;il involving the Taoiseach, leaking the story before the tribunal had heard it would help to do that. The well-orchestrated leaks come from more than one hand. With local and European elections coming up there was an incentive to get the worst of the news out of the way as quickly as possible. We need to know that this type of activity cannot happen within the Government party again. What safeguards are in place to ensure the financial conduct of Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Members? What preventive measures are in place? What is the punishment for tax evasion? We are being duped by a major PR strategy to dilute the bad news before the elections in June. We need to find out who breached the confidentiality of the tribunal and if there is any way of preventing this in the future. The slowness of production of vital documents requested by the tribunal seems part of the Government&rsquo;s hypocrisy in its dealings with tribunals of inquiry. The Government announced the setting up of tribunals describing itself as courageous in facing up to hard issues, and then drip fed the investigation with the necessary documentation as happened in the Laffoy and the Mahon tribunals.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy is possible because this Government has minimised its accountability to the public, the Opposition and the media. The D&aacute;il has been sidelined and 30 second interviews are all we hear from the Taoiseach, unless we hear a pre-recorded sanitised segment that is more like a party political broadcast than information. Following the fall-out from the Padraig Flynn affair, Fianna F&aacute;il is demonstrating a high tolerance for wrongdoing which is nowhere more obvious than in the broad election embrace for Mr. Flynn in Mayo in 2002.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax evasion is condoned by keeping a member of the party outside the parliamentary party but still within the party. That is how Fianna F&aacute;il did business in the 1980s and 1990s. It is crucial that the wrongdoers are found out and punished if we are to be sure that there is nothing rotten at the heart of Government today. It takes a special type of brass neck that is most prevalent in Fianna F&aacute;il to abuse a position in Government for personal gain. We have seen too many compromises on the key issues of today to be sure that there is a strong moral compass in the Government. On too many occasions it appears the public loses out, particularly in the area where so much tribunal work is focused, especially in the building industry. It seems unlikely that house prices could have doubled in such a short span of time without the Government&rsquo;s implicit support. It is unconscionable to think that there could still be <Col N="1074"/>corruption in an area which is under the spotlight today.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Much of the time delay in the tribunals has been as the result of deliberate tactics to slow them down and the actions of defence lawyers. Serious questions must be raised about the actions of individuals who have not allowed the tribunals to see the full picture. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may wish to take note of comments in the media and this House, suggesting that the issue of costs with which he says he is attempting to deal through legislation, may better be dealt with through reform of the profession of which he is a member. Tribunals are expensive because the legal profession is paid far too much. Instead of tackling the vested interests, with whom no doubt the Minister is on personal terms, he has attempted to further denigrate the tribunal process by suggesting that the nature of the tribunals is at fault. The fault lies with the greed of the vested interests. If this Government was serious about reducing costs of tribunals and litigation, the Minister would be leading a campaign to reform the legal profession. He wants instead to treat the symptoms rather than the cause. I thank Mr. Justice Flood for the work he has done in this regard.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution on the third interim report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. I compliment Mr. Justice Flood and his team for the work they have carried out on behalf of the people. The Labour Party believes that any person who receives a corrupt payment or who hindered or obstructed the operation of the tribunal, should be brought to task and made to pay for his or her actions. This report, like the previous one, relates to activities, actions, decisions and payments made and received by individuals involved in the planning process in Dublin County Council from 1985 to date. I was a member of the county council from 1983. As a councillor I worked tirelessly with a small group of Labour Party activists in endeavouring to win back the Labour seat in Dublin North. This was a daunting task given the political environment that existed in the constituency at that time, a matter to which I will return.</P>
    <P>Anyone present in the council chamber was well aware of the carry on. I was very conscious of the central role played by certain builders and developers in the planning process, especially when section 4 rezoning motions were on the agenda on a monthly basis and during the development plan review. The interaction between the landowners, builders, developers and their agents, and the Fianna F&aacute;il and most of the Fine Gael councillors, was very evident. I was present and witnessed agents for these people drafting rezoning motions and amendments in the packed public gallery &mdash; there was not much room for the ordinary public. These were then <Col N="1075"/>passed into the chamber to willing councillors who were prepared to submit motions in their own names.</P>
    <P>I witnessed the way the voting was organised to ensure that as far as practicable, the timing of votes was scheduled to suit the rezoning lobby. If the outcome was uncertain, which was not often the case, a runner would be sent to Conway&rsquo;s pub to ensure that any stragglers in the pub were whipped into the chamber to ensure that another rezoning was carried. It would have been very unusual if a celebratory drink or party were not on the agenda for Conway&rsquo;s pub or the Royal Dublin Hotel after the meeting, paid for, of course, by the new millionaires.</P>
    <P>Ray Burke&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in the constituency was awesome at the time. There never seemed to be a shortage of manpower, transport, including lorries for posters, or meals at election time, and all of the boxes in the polling stations were manned and paid for. As a party we always suspected that payments were made by developers for services rendered for election purposes. This was the machine the Labour Party had to take on not only in the council chamber, but also in the constituency to win back the Labour seat.</P>
    <P>Even though we had no money to run campaigns, I was proud of the decision taken by my wife, Patricia, and me when we entered politics not to accept contributions from builders and developers in case it might in any way undermine decisions we would have to take. Notwithstanding that, as I have said before, I received unsolicited cheques, which we never cashed and all of which I brought to the attention of the tribunal. If I, as an objective person looking at the proper planning and development of the area, received unsolicited cheques, which were never cashed, what contributions were made to the election funds of those who supported rezoning motions over the years?</P>
    <P>The second interim report in particular outlined what we were up against. The report concluded that offshore bank accounts were set up in the Isle of Man and Jersey to accommodate corrupt payments, mainly to Ray Burke. This money was to be used a political slush fund. As far as I can recall the accumulated payments of all the contributions of which we are aware came to more than £250,000.</P>
    <P>The third report concluded that George Redmond, Frank Reynolds, Joseph Murphy junior, and Michael Bailey hindered or obstructed the operation of the tribunal. Many of these are closely connected with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. Furthermore, Joseph Murphy junior and Michael Bailey made corrupt contributions to George Redmond. In one way or another all of these people, and there may be many more, were major players in the planning process. Is it any wonder that the planning system was debased and the general public was totally disillusioned?</P><Col N="1076"/>
    <P>In light of the revelations from the tribunal, has the role of the developer and landowner changed with regard to planning? A pertinent question must be asked as to whether a development plan should be governed by land ownership and be developer-led, or governed by the proper planning and development of an area. Like the Minister, I acknowledge that lands must be rezoned for housing. While I acknowledge there is a role for builders and developers, should it be the central role? This is a fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>In the context of whether things have changed, I refer to a letter I sent to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on 16 January. In the letter I stated: &ldquo;I requested you to carry out an investigation into the circumstances of the proposal to rezone 84 hectares (200 acres) of sensitive (some highly sensitive) lands to residential A1, which is part of variation 34 Donabate lands which was recently passed by Fingal County Council.&rdquo; While I have received an acknowledgement of the letter, I have received nothing else to date. The land which is elevated and forms part of the wider peninsula overlooking the Broadmeadow and Malahide estuaries, was purchased by developers with a view to having it rezoned as residential, to accommodate up to 2,500 dwellings even though at present a local farmer seeking to build a single house for his son would be unlikely to secure planning permission given the sensitivity of the land.</P>
    <P>Following research over about two years, the Donabate planning study report March 2003 was published, and was approved and signed off by the county manager. His planning department advised that any development on this land would have adverse implications for this area of coastline in landscape and visual terms and recommended, in particular, that building not take place in extremely sensitive areas. The council planners were very concerned about the proposal. This opinion was also supported by studies commissioned by Fingal County Council from consultants Brady Shipman Martin in May 2001 and February 2003.</P>
    <P>The Donabate study was due to be discussed at the Balbriggan/Swords area committee on 27 March 2003, which did not have a Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael majority. However, it was removed from the agenda the day before the meeting and deferred to a future meeting, as &ldquo;certain people&rdquo; were unhappy with the contents of the report. Less than three weeks later, an amended report, the Donabate planning study report April 2003, was published and was brought before a special meeting of Fingal County Council on 6 May. The new amended report recommended that the 200 acres of sensitive lands be zoned A1 which was totally at variance with the previous report. I am aware that at least one councillor was extremely angry with the original March 2003 report and made this known to the officials. Furthermore, and interestingly, it was decided not to present <Col N="1077"/>the new report to the area committee meeting as originally envisaged, but to bring it before the full county council meeting.</P>
    <P>In view of the inconsistencies contained in the two reports, I appeal to the Minister of State and his senior Minister, Deputy Cullen, to carry out an investigation into the variation process from the very outset to the publication of the reports and furthermore to ascertain what representations were made to have these lands zoned A1, especially between 24 March 2003, when the first report came out, and 6 May 2003. There was a time period of three weeks involved.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the alteration of the plan was justified on planning grounds. These are the facts. Sensitive lands were purchased &mdash; an area of 200 acres &mdash; for which it was difficult to obtain planning permission. After a study lasting two years, the council&rsquo;s report recommended against zoning 200 acres of land to residential A1. Certain people, including the developers and some councillors, were unhappy with the plan. Then the original plan was pulled at a meeting. After three weeks a new, amended report recommended rezoning the 200 acres.</P>
    <P>What should be the role of the developer or landowner in planning? Who receives priority? Is it the landowner or the community who will have to live with the consequences? In this case, the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors who bulldozed this plan through the council made their priority very clear. As a public representative who became aware of irregularities and undue influence being used by certain councillors, I felt I should stand up and be counted. If I felt that something wrong had happened, I had a duty to those who had elected me and to myself, as a person who has always stood up for proper, open discussion and debate. The Minister says the best way to obtain the right decisions &mdash; decisions which encourage sustainable development &mdash; is to ensure they are made in an open, transparent way that can be measured against standards. Notwithstanding the decision that was taken, transparency is required in the plan I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The people are disillusioned because of what they see happening in the tribunals. It is easy for certain people to put the message across that all public representatives are the same and they are all at it. I, as a public representative and a member of the Labour Party, and my colleagues in the Labour Party at local and council level, were never involved in any skulduggery or corruption. We will continue to stand for sustainable development and transparency. If the report helps us to identify those people who brought corruption into this process, they should be dealt with. It is to be hoped we can learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that in the future, people can have confidence in the planning process and that young people will be more prepared to go into politics at local level.</P>

	<P>The third interim report of the Flood tribunal, now known as the Mahon tribunal, was an indictment of the rampant corruption that existed in the area of planning and development in the Dublin region. As the report deals specifically with Dublin, I will discuss the consequences of corruption for the larger Dublin area. My comments are in sympathy with the victims of George Redmond &mdash; those citizens who continue to suffer because an official put his own greed ahead of the welfare of citizens. The legacy of George Redmond and his cohorts is the vast estates, lacking in both infrastructure and amenities, which sprawl across the western and northern edges of the city as a direct result of the corruption which led to bad planning. These estates are plagued by many social problems. Large estates were built with no amenities or outlets for young people. The human cost of this cannot be calculated, nor can the cost to the taxpayer. The people who continue to suffer because of the actions of Mr. Redmond, Mr. Lawlor and others cannot be ignored. Corrupt officials such as George Redmond made large personal fortunes on the back of the misery of ordinary citizens, who continue to suffer to this day from decisions that were taken in the past.</P>
    <P>It is more disgraceful still that the actions of Mr. Redmond and others were well known within the political establishment, yet nothing was done. This fact is being ignored by the present coalition. The Government must take action as a matter of urgency. It must improve conditions for people who live in these estates and make funding available to ensure proper facilities and amenities are now put in place. It must also address the loss suffered by these communities over the last decades as a consequence of the actions of Mr. Redmond and the inaction of the political establishment.</P>
    <P>The role played by the endemic corruption of the last 30 years in the current housing crisis cannot be ignored. Corruption has had consequences such as driving up house prices through deliberate sleight of hand. Liam Lawlor used bribery to change the address of a development so that a builder could charge and extra &euro;5,000 per house. There are land-holding and rezoning decisions which have never been addressed by any Government. People made fortunes as a result of inside information and corrupt politicians got away with it. The list of those who have appeared and are due to appear at the Flood and Mahon tribunals is a testament to the extensive nature of the corruption in this State. If this Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government is sincere and wants to show us it has moved away from the corruption of the past, it must prioritise addressing the social consequences of that <Col N="1079"/>corruption. They must prioritise resolving the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>I reiterate a request made by my party and me when the first interim report of the Flood tribunal was debated here. At that time I suggested that in view of the role played by the former Minister, Ray Burke, in planning corruption, the remit of the tribunal should be extended to cover all of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s activities, particularly those undertaken when he was a Minister. As Minister, he changed the licensing terms governing oil and gas exploration in 1987. This was a disgraceful U-turn. The terms of the fiscal regime that governs this area have often been questioned in light of the scandalous give-away of our natural resources. They were sold off to multinationals. Given that this radical change took place at a time when Mr. Burke was, as it were, active in the planning process, it is only right that his role in this extraordinary change in the island&rsquo;s gas regime should also be examined.</P>

    <P>The third interim report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments correctly labels as corrupt payments made to procure decisions which would enrich landowners and developers. In the planning tribunal the veil has been lifted just a little on the insatiable greed driving some officials, many developers and many politicians from the right wing parties. In 1997, there was a mood among the Irish people to have an investigation into this corruption in planning. Seven years later, however, there is growing cynicism and weariness about the long drawn-out nature of the tribunals and the huge costs to the taxpayer. When we now speak of tribunal millionaires, we do not mean the wealthy developers and business people who have to explain themselves to the tribunal but also a group of lawyers who have become millionaires through the level of fees which they have been awarded, many of them from taxpayers&rsquo; funds.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s and 1990s, corruption was endemic among some of those who had key roles in the planning of the greater Dublin area. Corruption was rife in particular at the murky interface where developers dealt behind closed doors with councillors from Fianna F&aacute;il and many from Fine Gael. I believe that it was known at all levels of those parties that this corruption existed but <Col N="1080"/>neither the leadership nor anybody else associated with those parties moved to root out this corruption. How serious is Fianna F&aacute;il about the issue of corruption when developers are seen explaining payments and murky dealings before the tribunal in Dublin Castle and an hour later, following a helicopter trip, they can be seen moving comfortably around the Fianna F&aacute;il enclosure at the Galway races, treated apparently with the same respect by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers as are the owners of million euro stallions, which they continue to exempt from tax?</P>
    <P>There is still a sickening double standard and hypocrisy on the part of the establishment in this State with regard to corporate corruption. While a few prosecutions have been mounted for planning corruption, the shadow of a garda has never fallen on the plush carpets of the boardrooms of the major banks in connection with the systematic taxation fraud in which they engaged, amounting to &euro;1 billion or more. Much less has the hand of a garda touched the collar of a director or chief executive of one of those banks. By contrast, however, 22 working class people found themselves jailed last autumn within days of mounting a peaceful protest against the dishonest stealth taxation policy of the Government through refuse taxes.</P>
    <P>Those involved in corruption must be swiftly exposed and brought to book. The root of corruption, speculation and building land, must also be dealt with by bringing building land into public ownership and rooting out speculation. Furthermore, the terms of the licensing of companies for oil and gas exploration must be investigated in the context of the role played by the former Minister, Mr. Burke. There must be an explanation for why the fabulous natural wealth off our shores has been given to major multinational corporations for nothing as a result of the changes Mr. Burke engineered.</P>

	<P>It is not enough time, one could speak for five years about the corruption that has occurred. In case some of my Opposition colleagues are wondering why I am sitting on the Government backbenches, I want to see if I can talk about planning and keep a straight face. Unfortunately, I cannot. However, I will try to bring some sense to the Government backbenches.</P>
    <P>This issue is not simply about what happened previously and the revelation of the scurrilous activities of Mr. Ray Burke, other Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Mr. George Redmond. George Redmond will, no doubt, read the reports of this debate tomorrow from a borrowed newspaper and still be oblivious to his involvement. His only response will be: &ldquo;Oops, I got caught and they were all doing it&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1081"/>
    <P>What lessons have been learned? The Mahon report is damning about Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s involvement with the Forest Road lands and payments by Mr. Bailey to Mr. Redmond in 1988 and 1989. The only payment that did not fall within the tribunal&rsquo;s definition of corrupt payment was the payment of £15,000 at the Clontarf Castle Hotel in July 1989. It was compensation for not appointing Mr. Redmond as a consultant.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have dealt with other aspects of the report so I intend to focus on the fact that county managers and assistant county managers can, within weeks of their retirement, get onto the cushy gravy train provided by developers. It is happening everywhere. The city manager was apparently oblivious to the carry on of Mr. Redmond. Another individual, Frank Kavanagh, within weeks of retiring from South Dublin County Council, rang me up. He said:</P>
    <P LI="1">Hi, Paul, Jim Mansfield is doing a development in Citywest. It is a tourism golf development. Would you be interested in supporting it?</P>
    <P FLI="0">Surprisingly, I said:</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the findings of the report is that there is no recommendation about former city and county managers having a period of leave before they can work for developers. Inside information is being traded on an ongoing basis and, in some cases, being prepared before they leave. If an official is working hand in hand with a developer and leaves, with a vast reservoir of knowledge, to work as a private operator, there are strong grounds for questions to be asked. I call on the Minister to take whatever action is necessary to prevent people in local authorities from working, in any capacity, for developers for a period of three years after their retirement. Otherwise there will be chaos.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are in chaos. When the vote about Citywest was taking place, I asked if any members had a conflict of interest. Of course, Mr. Colm McGrath still voted in favour of Mr. Mansfield&rsquo;s development. This is happening throughout my constituency &mdash; Quarryvale, Adamstown, Laraghcon in Lucan and Palmerstown. The land map of my constituency is like grafitti on a city centre wall on the Sunday <Col N="1082"/>morning after the Saturday night and embossed by a ring of puke. There are no facilities and no coherent planning. That is due to the likes of Mr. Redmond, as outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>I am sure we will read about more corrupt individuals in the next couple of years as the Mahon tribunal continues its deliberations. Are Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats sincere about learning the lessons? The Minister says he supports the work and findings of the tribunal. Will he do something to ensure there are no more tribunals or, at least, minimise their number by tightening up the legislation, imposing fines on people who have conflicts of interest and do not claim them and providing for large fines and imprisonment for former city and county managers and senior executives in local councils to ensure they do not work for developers and share their knowledge? If I was trying to get a planning extension on my house I would have great difficulty getting to talk with planners. Lessons need to be learnt within the body politic from Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s activities. I have a few short words for the Minister: please, learn the lessons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nice to see Deputy Gogarty has joined the Government benches.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>He is preparing for the next Government. I think he is in about the right spot.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with any other Deputy. It is a ten minute slot and I intend to speak for about five minutes. I cancelled appointments elsewhere to speak in the House and I hope it is appreciated.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Gogarty said. Significant corruption clearly exists in local government. The tribunal&rsquo;s report makes for sorry reading. The report deals with a senior official who faced the courts and paid the penalty. He was a powerful man in terms of his brief and the planning permissions he granted. His peers and his community trusted him. They invested in him the credibility and authority of the planning system. He abused and corrupted the system and reduced it to a shambles. Every day, reports reveal more people are dragged into this disgraceful story.</P>
    <P>What is the Government doing about this situation? I found nothing new in the speech given by the Minister of State. Reference is made to the Ethics in Public Office Act, but this has been in existence for some years. Declarations of interest have also been required for some years. There is nothing which will fundamentally change the way planning is done in this country. The Minister of State claimed he is waiting for the tribunal results and its recommendations, but surely the Government is not bereft of its own recommendations on how things should change.</P>
    <P>The most significant area of corruption exposed by the report concerns rezoning. I cannot see why the Government has not introduced legislation to separate planning applicants from councillors and officials when these decisions are <Col N="1083"/>being made. The planning process is supposed to be a quasi-judicial system. The county manager operates in the manner of a judge while the jury consists of the elected members. If that were in a court of law, one would not have, as happens at present, lists of applicants for rezoning going to every councillor in the country, developers knocking on doors and making phone calls or other people acting on their behalf. Such actions would not be tolerated in a court case where nobody is allowed approach the jury or make representations.</P>
    <P>A clear distance should be evident between the elected members, officials and the applicants. The only way to ensure this, is for rezoning applications to be made to the council in writing and, if needs be, the developers can be invited to discuss their plans further. The process needs to be done in an open, transparent way in public. We are all aware that people knock on doors, make phone calls late at night and early in the morning and generally apply pressure. This should no longer be acceptable in our democracy. That is the fundamental issue the Minister of State needs to address.</P>
    <P>Files are produced when a planning application is made. However, no phone call records are available. One does not know who rang and what it was about. The law should be changed to provide that information on any representation would be put on the record, be it from a councillor or anybody else. A summary of the information given in phone conversations with councillors and others should also be kept. This would get around the system of the nod and wink in planning matters. Everything must be transparent and a matter of public record, obviously in summary form in many cases. In that way we will achieve true transparency and openness.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gogarty that, on retirement, whether early or not, officials of a local authority, be they county managers, engineers or planners, should not be allowed to work in that administrative area for a minimum period of one year after they have ceased working there. In the private sector they could well deal with files and issues that previously concerned them. They may even have written the reports or commissioned them. A clear distance must be evident. The excellent officials, engineers and so on who retire can work in other administrative areas if they wish but not in the one in which they earned their bread for the best part of their working lives.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to instruct the three county managers of Fingal, South County Dublin and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, the successor councils to the former Dublin County Council, to pursue the repayment to each council of all moneys lost to them by the corrupt activities of George Redmond, as set out <Col N="1084"/>in the Flood-Mahon tribunal report No. 3 published last month. The corrupt activities of George Redmond cost Dublin County Council, its citizens and ratepayers a fortune. It is appropriate that whatever steps are necessary should be taken to recover this money and to recompense the communities short-changed by the corruption clearly set out in the report. It is deeply regrettable that the Minster of State has not offered any mechanism for the public to be recompensed for the losses incurred by them as a result of the corruption of George Redmond and the others named in the report.</P>
    <P>George Redmond is now in jail having been found guilty by a jury of serious corruption during his service as an officer of Dublin County Council. Mr. Justice Flood has released to the public his conclusions after an exhaustive and detailed public tribunal of inquiry into Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s finances and affairs. In chapter three he concluded that, for many years, Mr. Redmond lodged money to his various accounts amounting to many multiples of his council salary and that this money was received from developers and builders operating in the County Dublin area, especially Fingal. He concluded that the value of these payments for each year represented the value of a substantial house given to him free of charge. Let us imagine that in today&rsquo;s money. The value of a substantial house in Castleknock, Swords or any part of Fingal was received by Mr. Redmond every year, free of charge. A substantial house in Castleknock today is worth perhaps &euro;700,000.</P>
    <P>He did not get it for nothing. He made sweetheart deals to facilitate different builders and developers. Their names are well-known. Many of them are regular drop-in callers to Fianna F&aacute;il hospitality tents where the Taoiseach did not appear to have a problem rubbing shoulders with and glad-handing people whose activities are the subject of Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s devastating conclusions. The judge set out in great detail the different services Mr. Redmond offered to his patrons and concluded that the county council lost large sums of money through the actions of Mr. Redmond in his corrupt efforts to set up things for these builders and developers. Chapters three and four of the report set this out.</P>
    <P>The developers saved a fortune from lower development levies and charges and rewarded Mr. Redmond accordingly. He received 10% of what they saved from these activities. Chapter six concluded that Mr. Redmond provided information to a developer in return for payment. In chapter six, paragraph 11, the judge concluded that payments made to Mr. Redmond by a named developer were corrupt payments designed to take advantage of decisions he made in his capacity as a local authority officer.</P>
    <P>The report runs to many pages and every one is an indictment of Mr. Redmond and all his works. I am certain every official who works for a county council is as horrified as I am about the sorry tale of Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s activities.</P><Col N="1085"/>
    <P>In the case of Fingal County Council, the manager should now take immediate action to remedy the injustice and the loss that has been caused to the council. The lands described in the report are now part of County Fingal. The development levies and charges were money properly and legally due to provide services to people and businesses in Fingal. Huge sums were lost in those years because of corruption. This money should be recovered now. The Revenue Commissioners insist on unpaid tax being paid with interest and penalties. I suggest that the managers of Fingal and the other old Dublin county councils adopt the same aggressive approach. Furthermore, I want the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to instruct and empower them to do this.</P>
    <P>We are owed this money by the developers who bought Redmond. Redmond himself owes us this money. It would be a crass injustice to Fingal taxpayers and ratepayers to allow these people to get off scot free and to keep their corruptly gained moneys and advantage. The Criminal Assets Bureau should be involved to recover these moneys, as should the Garda and the courts. The Government should not delay the long-promised corruption assets bureau any longer. There should be only one response to this report; we make the guilty parties pay and pay and pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister is silent on the question of Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s large pension. Why should the average pensioner live on a relatively modest pension while someone like Mr. Redmond, who has been identified and found guilty of corruption, continue to enjoy a large pension far in excess of what other pensioners enjoy?</P>
    <P>These tribunals are vital to clear up our democracy. Deputy O&rsquo;Dea is often wheeled out by Fianna F&aacute;il to say that no one is interested in or cares about the tribunals. Mr. Justice Flood is owed a debt of gratitude. However, I wish to refer to what other Deputies have referred to. Much of this is still going on. I received 43 threatened actions from the combined Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors on the old Dublin County Council because I had the temerity to suggest that money might be changing hands in the carry-on described earlier by Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan. The carry-on was disgraceful; one would not see such wheeling and dealing at the Ballinasloe horse fair. People would pull at one&rsquo;s coat in the corridors of the council building, imploring one to vote for this, that or the other motion. People were running from the council chambers to Conway&rsquo;s pub. It was as if there was an umbilical cord between the pub and the chambers of the old Dublin council.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been subjected to the threat of legal action will know what I went through. My family and I had to endure the threat of highly paid legal guns going after me because I dared to suggest that the behaviour was deeply improper and that the public would think money was <Col N="1086"/>changing hands over these deals. How naive was I?</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned at what is still happening in Fingal. No sooner do various senior managers and planners retire, than they commence work with the developers and landowners. This is deeply inappropriate. It is one of the reasons people wonder if they can have confidence in the planning process. The Government has a responsibility to clean this up. There is a significant amount of work to be done if we are to retain the confidence of the people in the planning process. So far, the Government has run away from it. The Minister of State must tell us what he proposes to do to recover the moneys lost to the taxpayers and ratepayers of Fingal County Council.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>At times is seems as if the Flood and Mahon tribunals have been hanging over the political and planning systems for an eternity. The public interest has flagged and is reflected in the attendance at the hearings at Dublin Castle. The Taoiseach has only himself to blame for the circumstances where the Gilmartin module is only now being scrutinised seven years after the tribunal was established. It is an outrageous delay. I am not sure if the Statute of Limitations applies to this tribunal.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has been underresourced, particularly when compared to inquiries in other jurisdictions. The tribunal has taken one year, when it sat for only 85 days, to deal with the Burke module. This clearly indicates the level of commitment. The Bill that came before the House yesterday may allow the presiding judge to provide for parallel modules. When will the tribunal finish? It has been an ongoing saga and has been well illustrated in re-enactments on Vincent Browne&rsquo;s radio programme. It has become a comedy of sorts. It is regrettable that this has been allowed to continue in such a manner.</P>
    <P>We are indebted to Mr. Justice Flood for his hard work and for bringing to justice the people who hindered his work. It would be regrettable if any decision on costs arising from the Mahon tribunal were overturned on the grounds that it must honour the established practice that the judge who tried the case decides costs. This would be outrageous. Sadly, in spite of the importance of a prompt Government response to this challenge, it is no surprise the Bill that came before us yesterday did so more than six months after the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and 18 months after the publication of the second interim report of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>When one notes that there are only five or six lawyers working full time on this and up to &euro;34 million has been collected by the CAB and the Revenue Commissioners, one will see the tribunal has been self-financing. In the interest of the body politic and regarding the perception of politicians, there is no reason this has been <Col N="1087"/>allowed to continue. The regrettable drip, drip nature of the system is like Chinese water torture.</P>
    <P>Despite the delays and the bureaucracy, the tribunal&rsquo;s report is proof that the system is worthwhile. It is important that the Government gives more resources to Judge Mahon so that he might take on different modules. It has been seven years since the tribunal was established. The tribunal spent a year dealing with the Ray Burke module and another year dealing with the Century Radio module. Even though modules are effective, when one looks that the manner in which the Hutton and Saville inquiries were dealt with, the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the tribunals will be questioned.</P>
    <P>The Government has allowed the cancer of corruption to affect the body politic for too long. While many names have been mentioned and many people have been brought before the inquiry, there has been little action. Barring Mr. Redmond, nobody has gone to jail as a result of this. The extent and level of accommodation Mr. Redmond provided was outrageous. Many iconic moments and images associated with corruption have entered the public mind: blank cheques, brown paper bags and the excellent reconstructions on the Vincent Browne show. However, it has become a subject of comedy throughout the country. The level of debate and re-enactment is enjoyed by many people. We in Fine Gael, along with the Government parties, have allowed everyone involved in politics to be tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <P>There is the Ethics in Public Office Act, to which everyone has signed up at council level. I am certain that the welcome legislation with the solid declaration of interest and so on will be very important. I would be disappointed if it were not complied with by all elected councillors and Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la. However, I believe they are complying; it is a strict code of conduct. It is a great honour to be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and represent one&rsquo;s constituents in the national Parliament. However, it is equally important that what happened in the 1980s and 1990s be swiftly brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s response has been disappointing. There has been a neutering of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and a refusal to change the culture of secrecy, spin and silence. That is regrettable because the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was an effective tool to see what was going on. I know that Deputy Durkan has spoken on this theme on numerous occasions. It has very much been silenced. Even this week, the Government is intent on rolling through electronic voting, despite the dubious nature of the awarding of the public information campaign to a company headed by a former Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary and rubber-stamped by a ministerial political appointee. All these matters are important. I am not saying that the Minister is not doing his job correctly, but when one sees what is going on in politics and the level of <Col N="1088"/>transparency, a cloud is engendered. Whether the aspersions cast are political or created by the media, they exist.</P>

    <P>The Government has learnt nothing, but we in Fine Gael might be able to help it. The Fianna F&aacute;il 1997 manifesto said that the party had the opportunity to restore the people&rsquo;s confidence in the process of Government and to address frankly the demands to eradicate all unethical conduct from public life. That stands as an indictment of Fianna F&aacute;il and all the mistrust it has sown among the people.

	<P>More revelations will come and Fine Gael will be ready and waiting to hold to account everyone who has abused the trust and raided the bank accounts of the people. That is the real issue. People are in a privileged position in Cabinet. It is a fantastic honour to be a Deputy, but to be a Minister is a privilege. Clearly, the mistrust and abuse of power are of unbelievable proportions.</P>
    <P>At the Committee of Public Accounts, a major VAT scam involving builders was raised. It allowed them to pocket &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000 on top of escalating house prices. It was an unbelievable loophole in the taxation system. There is a two-tier political system in this country for those who are in a privileged cartel and can avail of the nod and the wink and the advantages of being in Government. That must stop. It has clearly been abused to the point where it has become a major situation. One must remember that Fine Gael has, regrettably, been in office for only two and a half years since 1987, and that is a very short span.</P>
    <P>We have heard about local government reform. I was disappointed to hear today that Deputy Ring lost his case. That was the only reform by the Government. It spoke about local government reform, but all that came was the abolition of the dual mandate.</P>

	<P>It is disappointing that nothing came of the opportunity to bring in real local government reform with changes in planning relevant to local issues. It is very much controlled by the county manager at the behest of the Minister of the day. That must change, and one hopes that Fine Gael in office in future will make fundamental changes to local government to bring real power to local members elected by the people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Better local government could be described instead as worse local government; it can certainly be described as more centralised local government. What Deputy Perry said is true. The only reforms introduced under this heading have been the removal of the dual mandate and electronic voting. These can hardly be regarded as major positive impacts on society. However, they create a centralised version of local government. I can see the day fast approaching when one person, with one computer, will be able to control every local authority in the country, this House, its voting system and the voting system outside it if the present Government has its way. They did that in other countries, for example, in eastern Europe after 1945. They had a more crude system for <Col N="1090"/>doing it, but it was the same thing. It was centralised power, authority and local government.</P>
    <P>The much-vaunted better local government about which we have heard so much simply means more bureaucracy, centralisation, managers, delegation to managers, internal conferences, and interminable meetings. When a member of the public goes looking for a member or official of a local authority, they are invariably at meetings, usually a meeting of themselves. They are meeting a group of their own people, despite the fact that they work with them in the next room.</P>

That leaves the way open for worse things to happen than we have seen. The Flood report should be able to illustrate that it can never occur again and that we will never again see a situation like that which we have talked about, with its corruption and bribery. The lesson for us all should now be that we do not have a centralised system where one, two, three or four people can control everyone&rsquo;s mind and, as a result, determine policy in their own way and in their own time.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>How do we prevent a recurrence? What has been put in place since to prevent one? The only legislation is the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Standards in Public Office Act. There has been nothing more. Incidentally, the regulations pertaining to local authorities are not nearly so stringent as those pertaining to the Oireachtas. I do not know why that has been the case, but it must be asked why it was done like that. After all, the abolition of the dual mandate removed the Oireachtas Members from the zoning of land and anything to do with that. How can it now be the case that there is a relaxed system regarding how the Electoral Acts affect local authority members and a rigid one regarding donations and the use to which they are put? There is a huge difference.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The constituencies for Deputies are of equal size, whereas a person standing in a local election in Dublin could require a quota of 3,000, while a candidate could be elected to a town council with 100 votes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Should I give the Minister of State a shovel to dig an even bigger hole? I have never heard such an explanation and if it reflects the thinking behind Better Local Government and the regulations appertaining to local elections, I am sad and sorry because we will have problems.</P>
    <P>I will give the House another practical example. While we all accept that the regulations which apply to the Oireachtas are fine, why should it follow that expenditure on elections to local authorities should be open-ended, provided it is recorded? How does one prove the amount is precisely as recorded given that a report into the figures recorded for the various elected Members following the previous general election indicated that they varied significantly? I presume we all read the legislation and regulations in the same way. I do not accept the notion that local and national elections be treated differently. Leaving it open to local authority members to spend as much as they like on elections, which some of them will do, leaves it open to question whether we will be able to prevent a recurrence of the circumstances which gave rise to this debate.</P>
    <P>Once political or financial corruption takes place in the kinds of circumstances addressed by Mr. Justice Flood, there is no way the average member of the public can get fair play. Regardless of whether corruption involves money or political favours, it eliminates fair play from the system and leaves the individual out in the cold. It does not matter how big the tent at Ballybrit, how convivial the atmosphere or how much champagne or other beverages consumed there, it does not take one whit from the fact that once one goes down the road of political favouritism or providing a return for financial contributions, the system becomes seriously defective. The third interim report is a crystal clear example of the manner in which business was conducted at the time under examination. Suggestions have been made, however, that favouritism continues to prevail, which would be a serious problem if it is the case.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cast aspersions on the Minister of State or his party, but when a party has been in power for all but two and half of the past 20 years, it poses a serious problem for the country. What amazes me is that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party received a mandate from the people, given that the allegations in question were in the public arena at the time and were widely known and discussed. Court cases, court challenges and so <Col N="1092"/>forth were under way so how do we explain the election result? With due deference to my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan from north county Dublin, the electronic voting in Dublin and Meath could have been part of the problem. I presume the electronic voting had no effect on the election result so it would not be fair to go down that road. We will deal with the issue of electronic voting on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Young people today face a serious problem in that they cannot understand the reason they are unable to buy a house. The reason is that the majority of houses are bought by investors for whom significant tax concessions are available. They move in quickly and snap up new houses which come on to the market. It is not unusual for a block of apartments to be sold over a weekend for &euro;240,000 or &euro;250,000 each. In one recent case, not far from my constituency, the unit price increased by &euro;80,000 during a weekend. Despair descends on young people when they see this kind of thing going on and they automatically conclude that something is wrong. I am deeply upset and discouraged at what I see happening, particularly given that the public, for some reason I cannot determine, saw fit to give the Fianna F&aacute;il Party an overall majority and would have done so had Tarzan not climbed up a pole and warned the oncoming multitudes of what was about to happen.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason corruption in Dublin and elsewhere continued without detection for so long. I made a similar comment on another matter yesterday. I am surprised that for a long time no action was taken on foot of reports I know were made. I am not suggesting that all zoning was corrupt or was approved under pressure &mdash; much of it was correct &mdash; but the process was brought into dispute by the mere fact that it was surrounded by questions about corruption. I would love to have more time to address these matters.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Third Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. I repeat that the Government has always fully co-operated with the workings of the tribunal and has acted to ensure that it is thoroughly and comprehensively resourced to do its work. Deputies will agree that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that all the facts surrounding allegations of corruption are revealed. Establishing the truth of what took place in the past is essential if we are to restore public confidence in the system and in ourselves, as public representatives. It is necessary to ensure that allegations and rumours do not continue to circulate because they affect those of us who are innocent of wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the third interim report is a valuable contribution. It is clear in its comments and comprehensive and unequivocal in its findings on George Redmond. Several Deputies suggested that the Government has been mean in providing resources for the tribunal. This is a most unfair allegation which I utterly repudiate. The Government has responded positively to all requests from the tribunal for resources.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The tribunal has cost &euro;31 million to date and is staffed by an extensive legal team and a 48 strong administrative staff. This report shows that the tribunal is more than capable of doing an effective job of uncovering acts of corruption. To date, the legal fees of the legal team amount to &euro;17.5 million. Other legal fees to non-tribunal counsel amount to just over &euro;1 million and administrative costs amount to just under &euro;12 million. The Government has made all resources available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on some unfair points made by some Members. Deputy Allen spoke about the leaking of information on the next phase of the tribunal and I agree that such action is scandalous. It is wrong to leak that information and obviously somebody is doing it to get his or her own spin out first.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should look behind him. We know who the experts are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <P>Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan and I were members of Dublin County Council. In my 16 or 17 years on Dublin City Council there was never any suggestion of that. The Deputy was there. I never received a cheque from a developer either. However, in a flippant way, the Deputy used to receive little cheques from a trade union of which we were both members. I was envious because I could not get them even though I was an activist at the time. That is just a private joke between Deputy Ryan and myself.</P>

	<P>It was 84 hectares.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the current information on the matter. I am not too knowledgeable on that matter. I welcome the comments made by the Members. I agree with the other speakers that many wrong things happened and that is being put right. Much has happened with regard to the rules for public representatives. Some speakers made good points about the issue of planners or managers retiring or changing jobs and that is an issue that has not been included in the code of behaviour. It could be a question of stopping a person&rsquo;s pension which may be right and proper action in one case but people would have concerns and reservations about it. It would need to be negotiated with the trade unions. People could be left in limbo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Burton, that is one way of dealing with it but there is no point in having a tribunal and allowing those who received money to keep it. The action is being taken by CAB.</P>

	<P>Yes. CAB deals with any money which is deemed to be corrupt. The Government is using other measures to plough back resources for facilities and amenities in west Dublin. For the sake of everyone, we must get to the bottom of that and take all possible action. Some people have been found guilty and many more need to be discovered. Public life must be put right for the sake of everyone.</P>

 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Maternity Protection (Amendment)" RHead="Bill 2003: Second Stage">
   <Title>Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Maternity protection is a fundamental right of any pregnant employee and one which has been enshrined in our legislation since 1981. The Maternity Protection Act 1994 further enhanced the existing legislation by implementing the provisions of the Pregnant Workers&rsquo; Directive 92/85 EEC. It retained all entitlements of the previous legislation and provided additional protection to pregnant employees. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] seeks to amend the 1994 Act to further improve the existing legislative protections for employees who are pregnant or who have recently given birth.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements in full the recommendations made by the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. The working group which reported in January 2001, was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government&rsquo;s An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The working group, which was chaired by my Department, included representatives from all pillars of social partnership, relevant Government Departments, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Health and Safety Authority and the Equality Authority.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the working group were accepted in full by the previous Government with the principal recommendations to extend the duration of maternity and additional maternity leave being immediately implemented in 2001. As a result, in March 2001 the period of maternity leave attracting maternity benefit payment increased from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and unpaid maternity leave increased from four weeks to eight weeks. The remaining recommendations which require primary legislation to amend the Maternity Protection Act 1994 will be fully implemented by the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill is but one component of a comprehensive package of measures dealing with workplace relations and environment agreed in the context of the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement. This particular element of Sustaining Progress <Col N="1096"/>comprises a package of legislation, codes and programmes which aim to protect employee rights, ensure greater equality, promote health and safety and bring about a better work-life balance.</P>
    <P>There is growing recognition in this country of the importance of work-life balance initiatives, not only in the context of assisting employees in combining employment and personal responsibilities, but also in underpinning economic, social and equality objectives. It is fair to say that many of our work-life policies have grown from the need to ensure that women are given an equal opportunity to participate in paid employment. The whole concept of work-life balance has evolved from this basic principle of gender equality to encompass the needs of a far wider group of employees with the goal of making the reconciliation of work-life responsibilities more achievable. It is vital that we continue to meet the challenge of developing innovative measures which reflect the reality of today&rsquo;s workplace for employees and the competing demands on their time due to personal and social responsibilities. We must ensure that both employers and employees see the development of work-life balance initiatives as a win-win situation for all involved. Research shows that appropriately designed work-life balance policies bring benefits to both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>From the employer&rsquo;s perspective these can include the retention of skilled and experienced staff, improved productivity and a more highly-motivated workforce. For the employees the benefits include not only the opportunity to better balance their working and personal lives but also a fairer sharing of home and family responsibilities between men and women.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 is timely as it coincides with the highest ever participation of women in the Irish workforce. The number of women in work in 2002 was over 678,000 &mdash; an increase of nearly 175,000 on the 1996 census and more than twice that recorded in the 1981 census. Recent statistics show that of the number of women currently in employment, over 67.8% are aged between 25 and 54 which indicates that a significant proportion of women in the workforce are of childbearing age. In 2002, 60,521 children were born and indications are that the number of births in 2003 was equally high. Last year, 30,211 maternity benefit payments were awarded to employed or self-employed women representing a 4% increase over the previous year. In this context it is imperative that our legislation recognises the valuable contribution made by working mothers and provides adequate support for them in the workplace, particularly at the time of childbirth.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains important new entitlements for breast-feeding mothers who often experience particular difficulty in returning to work after the birth of a child. National and international experts recognise that breast-feeding is the most <Col N="1097"/>beneficial method of infant feeding. In its global strategy on infant and young child feeding, the World Health Organisation states, &ldquo;breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants.&rdquo; Their strategy cites paid maternity leave, part-time work arrangements, on-site cr&egrave;ches, facilities for expressing and storing breast milk and breastfeeding breaks as conditions which enable women in employment to continue breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will bring Ireland closer to the international provisions for breastfeeding mothers. Section 9 provides that an employee who is breastfeeding and has informed her employer that she is doing so shall be entitled until the child is six months old to breastfeeding breaks, where facilities for breastfeeding are provided in the workplace, or to a reduction of working hours, without loss of pay in either case. This important new statutory entitlement will facilitate breastfeeding mothers on their return to employment. The recommendation of the maternity working group precisely mirrored the 1994 national breastfeeding policy recommendation that &ldquo;mothers should be encouraged to practise exclusive breastfeeding for at least four months and thereafter with appropriate weaning foods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>After the publication of the Bill in May 2003, the Department of Health and Children advised that Ireland was party to a resolution on infant and young children&rsquo;s nutrition, adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2002. This resolution approved the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s global strategy on infant and young child feeding which recommends:</P>
    <P LI="1">As a global public health recommendation, infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to two years of age or beyond.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister for Health and Children consequently announced the revision of the national breastfeeding policy on 5 August 2003 to promote exclusive infant breastfeeding for the first six months. The Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the Seanad to reflect this policy change.</P>
    <P>The health advantages of breastfeeding more than justify the introduction of these provisions. Medical research indicates that these advantages are maximised when breastfeeding is sustained for longer periods. Research commissioned by a number of health boards shows that returning to work can influence the decision of Irish women to cease breastfeeding. In a study commissioned by the Midland Health Board in 2000, for example, 30% of respondents cited returning to work as their reason for ceasing breastfeeding.</P><Col N="1098"/>
    <P>After the Second Stage debate in the Seanad, I undertook to examine the possibility of reducing the pre-confinement period of maternity leave. Under the present four-week compulsory pre-confinement maternity leave arrangements, many pregnant employees collude with their doctors to have false confinement dates included in their medical certificates so they can avail of a longer period of maternity leave after the birth.</P>
    <P>I was not entirely satisfied with the legal advice made available in the past. It was argued that a reduction in the compulsory pre-confinement period would be interpreted as a reduction in the level of protection afforded in the Act to pregnant employees, which would contravene the pregnant workers directive which prohibits regression. When I raised this matter with the Office of the Attorney General, the point was made that introducing a more flexible entitlement would enhance the statutory protection available, rather than diminish it. I subsequently received legal advice stating that the reduction of the period of compulsory pre-confinement leave in section 10(1) of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to two weeks does not reduce the level of protection and is not prohibited by Article 1.3 of the pregnant workers&rsquo; directive, provided that employees can avail of non-compulsory pre-confinement leave in excess of the two week period. This amendment will, in effect, allow new mothers to take up to 16 weeks of their paid maternity leave after the birth of their child. It gives them greater flexibility in managing their leave entitlements in a way which best suits their personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>During the course of its review, the maternity working group examined a proposal for paid time off for attendance at ante-natal classes. When it consulted the institute of obstetrics on the issue, the institute argued that a pregnant women needs to attend a complete set of ante-natal classes in the interest of her health and safety during the course of childbirth. Ante-natal classes form an intrinsic part of the ante-natal care package, particularly in a woman&rsquo;s first pregnancy. While the Maternity Protection Act 1994 provides, in accordance with regulations, for time off without loss of pay for ante-natal and post-natal care, the definition of ante-natal care does not include ante-natal classes. Accordingly, in line with a recommendation of the working group, section 8 provides a new entitlement for mothers to paid time off from work for the purposes of attending ante-natal classes.</P>
    <P>Fathers can offer invaluable support to expectant mothers during the pre-confinement stage. Their attendance at and participation in ante-natal classes provides them with an insight into and preparation for the birth, at which many fathers choose to be present. Information on the practical skills required to help care for a baby is also provided. Work commitments can mean that it is not always possible for fathers to attend ante-natal classes, however. Section 8 Bill seeks to address this by giving expectant fathers a once-<Col N="1099"/>off entitlement to time off work without loss of pay to attend the last two ante-natal classes in a set.</P>
    <P>While the overriding purpose of the review of the maternity protection legislation was to enhance the protections available to employees who are pregnant or have recently given birth, the working group took account of the costs to employers of its recommendations. Some of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will have minor cost implications for employers. Employer costs will be incurred in the provision of paid time off to attend ante-natal classes, the provision of breastfeeding breaks, where breastfeeding facilities are provided, or a reduction of working hours and the preservation of certain employment rights while on additional maternity leave. The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Department of Finance and the Health Service Employers Agency, which were represented on the working group were particularly mindful, as employers, of the cost element of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The working group also considered the concerns of female employees about combining pregnancy and caring for new-born babies with work commitments. It consulted a report, New Mothers at Work, commissioned by the Employment Equality Agency and published in 1999, which documents the difficulties experienced by 30 women in combining motherhood and the demands of the workplace. A strong theme which emerged from this research was that the women who were interviewed wanted to stay in the labour force, but felt inadequately supported by legislative and other measures in exercising their preferred choice. Some women indicated that the dual pressures of motherhood and work were too much and that they were reluctantly withdrawing from the workplace. While it was a small survey, it is indicative of the pressures faced by Irish women which may force them, unwillingly, out of the workforce. It is hoped that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions can help to alleviate such pressures by providing greater protection to pregnant employees and breastfeeding mothers returning to work after childbirth. There are gains for employers, as a reduction in the number of women dropping out of the workforce after childbirth will lead to a reduction in recruitment and training costs.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific provisions of the Bill, section 1 is a standard provision, dealing with interpretation. Sections 2 and 5 incorporate SI 29 of 2001 which gave effect to the working group&rsquo;s recommendation to increase the periods of maternity leave and additional maternity leave. The implementation of the recommendation to increase both the period of maternity leave and additional maternity leave, as mentioned earlier, has been in effect since March 2001. The implementation of this recommendation was fast-tracked ahead of the implementation of the other recommendations to ensure that the benefits of <Col N="1100"/>the increased leave entitlement would be realised as soon as possible. The consequent revocation of SI 29 of 2001 is provided for in section 26.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a new section, which was inserted into the Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad. As I explained earlier, it provides for the reduction of the compulsory period of pre-confinement maternity leave from four weeks to two weeks. Section 4 safeguards an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to the extended minimum period of 18 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave where premature births are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that in the event of the sickness of the employee, she may, with the agreement of the employer, terminate her period of additional maternity leave. Once terminated, the employee will not be entitled to take the remainder of the additional maternity leave at a later date. Any absence from work due to illness following the termination of the period of additional maternity leave shall be treated in the same manner as any absence from work due to sickness. Section 11 applies similar provisions to fathers who are entitled to such leave under the principal Act, in the event of the death of the mother during the course of her leave.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that in the event of the hospitalisation of the child an employee may, with the employer&rsquo;s agreement, request to postpone her maternity leave and/or additional maternity leave and return to work on an agreed date. It will be possible to postpone maternity leave only where the employee has taken at least 14 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave, four of which are after the end of the week of the birth. Where the employer agrees to a postponement and where the employee has adhered to certain notification requirements, the employee will be entitled to take her postponed leave in one continuous block known as resumed leave. This resumed leave must commence not later than seven days after the discharge of the child from hospital. If the employee is absent from work due to sickness during the period of the postponement, the employee is deemed to have commenced her resumed leave, unless she opts to forfeit the right to resumed leave. The absence from work due to sickness shall be treated in the same manner as any absence from work due to sickness. Section 12 applies similar provisions to fathers in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have already given a broad outline of the provisions included in section 8, which gives pregnant employees a new entitlement to attend ante-natal classes. A limited exclusion is provided in the case of members of the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving overseas or in other exceptional circumstances. It can sometimes be the case that a pregnancy does not go to full-term, for example, because of premature birth. In such cases, the mother may not have availed of her entitlement to attend a complete set of classes and, hence, section 8 also provides that the set of classes may be attended during one or more pregnancies. This allows time off from work for <Col N="1101"/>attendance at the missed classes in a subsequent pregnancy. The detailed arrangements relating to issues such as the amount of time off to be allowed for attendance at ante-natal classes, the terms or conditions relating to such time off, the notification procedures and the evidence of attendance to be furnished to the employer, will be covered by detailed regulations.</P>
    <P>The entitlement provided in section 9 to facilitate breastfeeding mothers in the workplace is an improvement on the recommendation of the working group. As I explained earlier, the improved entitlement to either breastfeeding breaks in the workplace or a reduction of working hours, without loss of pay until the child is six months old, mirrors national breastfeeding policy. Employers will not be required to provide facilities for breastfeeding breaks in the workplace where the provision of such facilities would give rise to more than a nominal cost. Where breastfeeding breaks are not provided, the employer shall be required to agree a reduction of working hours with the employee without reducing pay. The detailed arrangements relating to breastfeeding breaks or a reduction of working hours with respect to the amount of time off and the number and frequency of breastfeeding breaks to be allowed, the reduction of working hours to be allowed, the terms and conditions relating to breastfeeding breaks and/or reduction of working hours, the notification procedures and the evidence to be furnished to the employer concerning the date of confinement, will be prescribed further in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 10 incorporates the increased periods of leave entitlement provided for in Statutory Instrument No. 29 of 2001 for fathers where the mother dies during the period of her maternity leave. I have already referred to sections 11 and 12, which apply corresponding provisions to fathers as provided to mothers under sections 6 and 7, which deal with the termination and postponement provisions respectively.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends the definition of &ldquo;protective leave&rdquo; in the 1994 Act and provides that the period of leave taken prior to postponement and the period of resumed leave after postponement shall be treated as separate periods of protective leave. Section 14 provides that employees absent from work on additional maternity leave will be treated for the purposes of all employment rights, other than remuneration and superannuation benefits, as if they remained at work. It also adds new rights to attend ante-natal classes or to breastfeed to the list of absences in section 22 of the Principal Act, for which the employee shall be treated as if she were not absent from work. Employees who avail of the new entitlements to ante-natal classes and breastfeeding are afforded protection under sections 15 and 16 with respect to the termination or suspension of their employment.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a technical amendment to clarify that the provisions of the 1994 Act regarding periods of probation, training and apprenticeship, <Col N="1102"/>apply to both female and male employees who are absent from work on protective leave. Section 18 strengthens the provisions relating to the return to work of an employee who was on protective leave to give effect to the 2002 gender equal treatment directive. An employee returning to work from protective leave will have a statutory entitlement to any improvement in the terms or conditions of the employment to which she would have been entitled if she had not been absent on protective leave.</P>
    <P>Section 19 applies to employees returning to work on the expiry of protective leave who are offered suitable alternative work because the resumption of the work which they carried out before their protective leave is not practicable. In such a case, the terms or conditions of the alternative work shall not be less favourable to the employee than those of her contract of employment immediately before protective leave. An employee in this position will also be entitled to any improvement in the terms or conditions of the employment to which she would have been entitled if she had not been absent on protective leave. This section gives effect to the 2002 gender equal treatment directive. The remaining sections deal with technical amendments to the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is part of a wider package of statutory work/life balance measures to which my Department is committed under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. The Government has also approved the drafting of amendments to the Adoptive Leave Act, which will apply the appropriate outstanding recommendations of the maternity protection review group to the adoptive leave legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the House that the Government has approved a proposal to increase the adoptive leave period by two weeks to 16 weeks. The increase in adoptive leave is linked to the proposed reduction of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave as provided for in section 3. It effectively means that once the legislation is enacted, both natural and adopting mothers will be able to avail of 16 weeks leave with payment of Department of Social and Family Affairs benefit from the time a child is born or placed into their care. The amendments to the adoptive leave legislation will be published shortly in a new Bill. In addition, the parental leave legislation is also due to be amended in line with the agreed recommendations of the working group on the review of that Act. Work is currently under way in my Department on the necessary heads of a Bill and I expect that legislative proposals will be brought to Government in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of Deputies on this legislation, which will both strengthen and improve the employment rights of pregnant mothers and women who have recently given birth, and to those who wish to resume work while breastfeeding. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on the Bill, which I welcome. There is little wrong with the legislation but we cannot pat ourselves on the back in this respect because it is not introducing many new measures &mdash; it is more like window dressing. While the Bill tidies up matters, there are areas for improvement and we could do much more, as I am sure the Minister of State would admit. However, the legislation represents a good start towards getting things right.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify that the Bill, when enacted, will be retrospective for those who are currently on maternity leave?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which aims to improve maternity protection for employees. A large number of women contribute to our economy and it is only fair that their employment should be protected while taking time off to have children. Many women feel under pressure in this respect and, as the Minister of State said, it is difficult for parents to balance family life with a job. It is becoming increasingly stressful to do so in modern Ireland because work no longer entails 40 or 50 hours per week and, in addition, people have to commute for 20 to 25 hours per week. As the working day has become longer, it is becoming more difficult to take time out to start a family. When the cost of living is added to the equation we can understand that it is getting harder to balance work with family life. In this regard, while the Bill deals with certain aspects of maternity protection, it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the recommendations made by the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation, which was established in accordance with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The group consisted of the social partners and various Departments, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Health and Children. The Health and Safety Authority and the Equality Authority were also represented on the group. However social these partnerships may be, their interests do not always coincide precisely, so it is perhaps almost inevitable that any legislation devised in such a way would be somewhat timid, as evidenced in the Bill, which does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill as it marks a step forward in terms of protection and is more progressive than the 1994 Act, which has already been extended to afford protection by means of <Col N="1104"/>a statutory instrument. The other recommendations, however, required primary legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of the pre-confinement period to two weeks, which some members of the review group felt would serve the needs of pregnant women. It is well known that many women applying for maternity benefit put false dates on their application forms because they want more time off after the baby is born. This amendment, which was made in the Seanad, will now allow new mothers greater flexibility in managing their leave entitlements in a way which best suits their personal circumstances. In this regard, when the Bill is enacted, it is likely that the Government will be regarded in awe by the World Health Organisation for its ability to stop the vast majority of premature births by a new medication called the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill. We are gaining something from this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 4, which safeguards an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to the extended minimum period of 18 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave in instances of premature birth. While the reduction of the pre-confinement period to two weeks is a welcome measure, it will also be good for the planning and organisation of businesses. It can be awkward if when unexpected news arrives, an employer has made plans assuming that he or she will lose certain staff on a certain date. It is good for everyone and I am pleased to see it provided for. Although it was highlighted a number of years ago in the Seanad, it is a pity it took so long. Like everything else, it takes time but is good when it happens.</P>
    <P>While section 5 is also welcome, it simply amends the principal Act of 1994 by incorporating the provisions in the extension of period of leave order of 2001, which increased additional maternity leave entitlement to a maximum of eight weeks. I understand that is a sufficient period of time as the child is usually progressing well and the parents wish to get back to work. However, this should be monitored and, if there is a demand, we should be open to considering the provision of more time, especially where difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 11 provide that additional leave ceases if the mother falls ill, and that the absence from work due to sickness shall be treated in the same manner as any absence from work of the employee due to sickness. It is welcome that the employee can choose to transfer from unpaid additional maternity leave to sick leave. This is a good provision for all involved &mdash; children, parents and employers. I am open to suggestions on the issue of allowing maternity leave to resume after sick leave and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 12, inclusive, allow maternity leave to be postponed if a child is hospitalised, which is fair and welcome. If a child is hospitalised and the mother is able to go to work, the mother may prefer to do this and take the <Col N="1105"/>postponed leave with the child when he or she leaves hospital. While I welcome this, I am also concerned that the time left must be taken in one block. If a child of that age is sick, he or she would generally leave hospital but might soon return. I understand that parents have seven days before they must return to work. However, a child might often have to return to hospital within two weeks even though it might suit a parent to go back to work. It is perhaps too harsh to stipulate that the leave must be taken in one block. I would appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides paid time off work for expectant mothers to attend one set of ante-natal classes. This is misleading as the mother must attend the last three classes at her own expense unless the employer agrees otherwise. This arises because of an anomaly in regard to the change of pre-confinement time from four weeks to two. Parents should attend the last three ante-natal classes unpaid, with these classes spread over three weeks. It was assumed that the mother would be on maternity leave at that stage of a pregnancy and that, therefore, the classes were not an issue. However, a mother might still be at work for one of the three classes. I ask that this be addressed to ensure that mothers need take unpaid leave only for the last two classes. This would make the provision fairer and as family friendly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there is provision for fathers to attend ante-natal classes before the birth of the child. However, why does it allow for only two classes? Why is the father not entitled to attend the same number of classes as the mother? Both parents are encouraged to attend and this should be allowed for in the Bill. While the Bill goes far by allowing fathers to be paid for attending two classes, I am told that the two classes before the last class are the most important, as the last class is generally concerned with what happens after a birth, and goes as far as teaching how to put a baby in a car seat and so on. In view of this, mothers would prefer to have their partners attend for four of the five classes. Ideally, they would like their partners to attend all classes and perhaps the Bill should make provision to encourage this. I understand many of the classes are held in the evening so it would not cost much. It would set a good example and make a statement that we expect fathers to try to attend more than two classes.</P>
    <P>If classes are available both day and evening, could an option be provided whereby an employer could compensate a mother in order that she could work as well as attending the class at a more convenient time? While it is not a major issue, there should be scope to enable employers and employees work out arrangements which suit them best, rather than forcing employees to take time off. It would be good if an employee was allowed to take time off but she might not necessarily want that. Members will understand that some businesses find it hard to <Col N="1106"/>manage without certain staff, especially key staff. I would find it hard to survive if my assistant &mdash; my boss, as I call her &mdash; had to take time off. It would be good if other arrangements could be made and I would be grateful if the Minister of State could clarify this point.</P>
    <P>Section 9 refers to breastfeeding breaks and allows time off from work or a reduction of working hours for women who are breastfeeding. While this is welcome, there are no indications in the Bill as to the length of the period that the mother is entitled to breast-feed at work or an indication of the number of hours that she is allowed to have off in order to breastfeed. I understand this will be clarified by regulations and that the issue of time periods and the number of hours will be dealt with later, but I would like to hear more from the Minister of State on this. He mentioned a period of six months in this regard, which is the recommended level. The period was changed in the Seanad from four months. I am not convinced this change is any great achievement because maternity leave is currently 18 weeks plus eight weeks extra unpaid leave, if that is wanted, which is a total of six months. The change is not significant because the majority of mothers would take as much maternity leave as they could. Perhaps the period should be increased to 12 months. I understand that a high proportion of mothers are not breast-feeding, which is why it is being encouraged. To increase the period of leave even to nine months would be an improvement, but given that it is common for mothers to breast-feed for longer, a 12 month period would be preferable.</P>
    <P>Employers are not obliged to provide breastfeeding facilities if the provision of such facilities would give rise to a cost, other than a nominal cost. While this is fair, why has it been included in the Bill because it will make it easy for employers not to bother providing facilities? While I am perhaps underestimating this, it is not question of providing new rooms or having new wings built onto buildings; it is concerned with providing a suitable setting, such as a room with basic facilities. It would not cost much but, by including this provision, we may be giving employers too easy a way out if they do not provide such facilities. I will revisit this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill may discriminate against mothers who are bottle-feeding. While I understand that we are trying to encourage breastfeeding because it is good for the child, there are also mothers struggling with jobs and responsibilities who bottle-feed rather than breast-feed. Should they not be entitled to feeding breaks? What is the intent of the Bill in this regard? If a mother works near her home, is it intended that a child minder would bring the child to the workplace during breaks so that it could be breast-fed? If so, such mothers would have the luck to spend more time with their children but this would lead to jealousy among other mothers who, by choice or not, do not <Col N="1107"/>breast-feed. Should they not be allowed to bring their children into the workplace to bottle-feed and spend time with them? I raise this matter because I have heard such questions asked when speaking to people about it.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Bill protects women&rsquo;s entitlements and rights while on maternity leave and additional maternity leave, as laid out in sections 14, 18 and 19, the provisions of which are necessary and welcome. Women are the only sex which can bear children at present, unless science changes that, and it is only fair that they are not placed at a disadvantage in their place of work when taking time off to give birth and have time with their new-born babies. A significant number of queries that the Equality Authority receive are related to pregnancy, time off etc., and I hope the Bill will give some comfort and clarity to women who fear that their positions in work will be in some way jeopardised due to pregnancy.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is welcome and family friendly, it is a missed opportunity to go a step further at a time when most parents are in employment and seeking improvements in the position and flexibility of working arrangements, because modern life demands flexibility. The Bill is a start in the right direction but more should be done to help working families. It is difficult to provide child care in most areas and, while it is fine to give people time off, we must go further. Child care must be provided close to where people work and at an affordable price. The Minister of State has heard that child care can cost up to &euro;900 in some Dublin areas, whereas in Navan it can be &euro;150 a week. Even with child benefit allowances, this is a large amount of money, especially after tax is deducted. Is enough being done to facilitate child care? There needs to be more investment in non-profit child care facilities and more incentives to encourage employers to provide cr&egrave;ches. If there is a restriction in the provision of such facilities, employers should allow employees to work from home. There has to be more of an effort because the cost of access to good quality child care is very high.</P>
    <P>In the D&aacute;il, we do not set much of an example to employers, as there are no cr&egrave;che facilities. Some Deputies, God love them, have to bring their children to their offices and let them play on the computer. It is not always a female issue, as this morning I noticed two male Deputies with their children. One Minister who wanted to have some time with his son had to bring him into the restaurant which was full of us lugs talking politics. The Minister, who probably works a 140-hour week, simply wanted an hour with his child, but there is nowhere else to go but the restaurant.</P>

	<P>So much for family-friendly sitting hours.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, I was speaking with Deputy Enright, the other baby in the Fine Gael cr&egrave;che, on how sitting hours affect rural-based <Col N="1108"/>Deputies. It is said that the only cr&egrave;che in the House for us youngsters is the Fine Gael Party. It is difficult for rural-based Deputies if House sittings increase to five days per week. The D&aacute;il could sit six days a week and I would not be affected as I live in Meath and have no family. However, for rural-based Deputies, I wonder if we are going down the right route by increasing sittings just for the sake of keeping the media happy. The Fine Gael Party is calling for an overall reform of D&aacute;il sittings. It does not matter to me or to most people if the House sits late on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. However, it makes a big difference if another day is added. A rural-based Deputy will not be at home at 3.30 p.m. on four days to spend time with his or her children.</P>
    <P>A Member referred to the having a family as a factor in keeping women out of politics. Deputy Enright disputes this, claiming that there is nothing stopping a 20 year old coming into politics because she may plan for a family when she is 30. However, there is no maternity leave for a Deputy. I agree it is not possible to give a female Deputy three months off because she will probably lose her job. However, more paid time could be given to the father.</P>
    <P>Many young mothers get confused with maternity benefits, thinking that they will get full wages for the 18 weeks. There are information booklets on maternity benefits but for many mothers it does not occur to them until their employer informs them that they will not get their full wages for the 18 weeks. Maternity benefit is only 70% of income to a maximum of &euro;233 which is not much money. For a person on a wage of &euro;400 per week, 70% of that income means he or she is over the maximum threshold. How can one survive with rents alone costing &euro;800 per month? I understand money cannot be thrown around but these benefits should be examined. People need to be made aware sooner that they will not have all their wages.</P>
    <P>Moves need to be made on the spatial strategy and decentralisation programme. It is hard to be a working parent living in Navan and commuting to Dublin for up to three hours. Many of these jobs could be based outside of Dublin, allowing people more time at home with flexible hours. Flexible hours are useless for people working in Dublin and living in, say, Navan, as the journey time back and forth takes three hours. A policy of putting jobs beside homes must be developed. The Government must admit its failure in not getting jobs to follow the thousands of houses built in Navan, Kildare and Wicklow in recent years. The spatial strategy and decentralisation programme are only just talked about with no action being taken.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some of the Seanad amendments have been taken on board. There will be more amendments to the Bill in the D&aacute;il. Despite some missed opportunities in the Bill, I will be supporting it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the general thrust of this Bill. It is important that the rights of spouses be enshrined in this Bill. However, we constantly give rights through legislation but do not bestow responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It is right that the policy of breast-feeding, as identified, should be encouraged and supported. However, I notice that in the event of somebody not taking a breast-feeding break, they can take time off in lieu. It could be easy for someone who is not breast-feeding to claim she is doing so and take time off. What safeguards to prevent this will be in place? Will everyone get time off once they claim they are breast-feeding even if they are not?</P>

   <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that these procedures become automatic after a while and yet the breast-feeding policy will not be advanced.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that certain rights are being given to fathers, as many have felt hard done by. I believe John Waters is right when he gives voice to those fathers. At times, in the politically correct society, fairness does not govern what is acceptable as commentary. When John Waters tries to make a case, he ensures it is valid. There is a case to be made for men which is not often articulated by others. For that reason alone, the courage John Waters has shown in raising these issues for fathers is important. I do not want anything I will say about fathers to be misunderstood. We have to be fair, reasonable and careful to both parents in any situation.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>As we are bestowing rights on fathers, we should also consider bestowing responsibilities too. This is particularly the case where fathers leave all responsibilities regarding children with the mothers. Some fathers make no effort to contribute to the support of their children but instead enjoy the Bohemian life while the mother is tied to the child, even if she is working. I support John Waters in his argument for giving men a fair crack at the whip. However, there is also a case for men to take on their share of parental responsibility, particularly those who might not be in the family home. In the House, we are constantly talking about rights but it is time we also spoke about responsibilities. It is one of the ills of society that we all look out for our own rights but none of us seek to identify our responsibilities. Happily, most fathers, like most mothers are diligent and attentive, whether married or living together. Most fathers want to spend time with their children. I do not wish to make a general allegation or adverse comment, but many fathers do not take their responsibilities seriously and, literally and metaphorically, leave the mothers carrying the babies. That should be <Col N="1110"/>borne in mind and considered. When we come to tackle the rights of fathers we need to look at the responsibilities of both spouses.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of male suicide, although it is not covered by this Bill. The Minister of State referred in his speech to the increase in the number of women in the workforce In 2002, there were more than 678,000 women in the workplace, an increase of almost 175,000 on the 1996 census and more than twice the number recorded in the 1981 census. Much of this is due to women finding freedom and not being compelled to stay at home, which is welcome. In many cases the absence of both parents from the home has not been replaced by some other support for young males in particular. What contribution is this making to the level of young male suicide which appears to be at epidemic levels? I am not saying that mothers or fathers should not be out working. Nowadays both parents often need to work simply to pay the mortgage because house prices are so high. They are entitled to choose to work. Our economic growth would not have been possible without the contribution of women to the workforce because the participation of women had been so low heretofore. If we were to experience growth at the same level for the next ten years, we would not be able to draw on that. We would have to bring in immigrants.</P>
    <P>Have we left a vacuum in the home? Is it necessary to conduct a study on the relationship between the changes in the home environment over the past ten or 15 years and the level of young male suicide? Deputy Neville is the expert on this topic in the Oireachtas. He confirms that part of the problem is that young males have lost their way or their sense of a role. The man is no longer the breadwinner, the person who goes out to work while the wife stays at home. While there is nothing wrong in that, we have not taken into account any of the drawbacks to which that change may have inadvertently or directly contributed. It is a matter to which we should give some attention.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the general thrust of the Bill, and women, like men, make a significant and necessary contribution to the workforce, some of the tax incentives, especially individualisation, suggest to women who work in the home that their work is less valuable. That is not right. We should recognise the rights of women in the home as equal to those of women outside the home. If someone chooses for whatever reason to stay at home, because her children are at a certain age, as a temporary decision, or to take a few years break from the workforce to spend with her family, that should be construed as working. Those women are working in the home and they should be supported to work at home. There is a feeling among some that the work of women who choose to do so is not regarded as important.</P>
    <P>It may not be a fashionable view but this is important work. My colleague, Deputy John Bruton, has raised this in the past pointing out <Col N="1111"/>that the contribution of a mother to the home is not assessed in measuring gross national product. A mother can contribute not just to a happy home but to a happy community with all the implications that has for the future of society and the ability of young people to succeed. We need to examine the way we measure such aspects of society. Women working in the home should not be set against women working outside the home or <i>vice versa</i>. We should value both equally. Some women will find that they wish to do both throughout their careers. We should be flexible and support and recognise both because both make a significant contribution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill which I broadly welcome and will not oppose on this Stage. Of all the Bills that have come and will come before us during this session, such as the safety, health and welfare at work Bill, the health and social care professionals Bill and the adoptive leave (amendment Bill) Bill, the Maternity Protection Bill is one of the most important. Anything which affords more protection to our pregnant workers, is to be welcomed. However, it is outrageous that in 2004 we are tightening up legislation which should have been in place for many years as in other European countries. We are lagging far behind our European counterparts in dealing with such issues. More women are in the workforce and, in recent years, women have been targeted to enter the workplaces. While there is no doubt that some opportunities have opened up for women, many issues and obstacles remain in their path.</P>
    <P>The statistics bear out just how many women have joined our workforce between 1976 and 1996. By 2001, women in the workforce stood at 50% while the number of women with partners and children working increased from 44% to 50% in recent years. Numerous obstacles prevent women from participating fully in the workplace. The Maternity Protection Bill could go some way to ensuring this would no longer be the case. The Bill needs to address how to make it easier for women to make the transition from maternity leave back into the workplace, if that is what they wish. This Bill achieves that end.</P>
    <P>One major obstacle which stands in the way of women returning to the workplace, is cost and the lack of affordable child care. Ironically, this is not addressed in a Bill which deals with maternity rights, but we must consider this. Previous speakers have addressed the issue. While the contents of this Bill are welcome, we must deal with this issue if we are to be serious about helping women to enter the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes it is the responsibility of the State to provide child care and not that of the private sector which dominates the market. Every year, parents wait with bated breath for some help from the Government in the budget, only to find <Col N="1112"/>themselves repeatedly excluded. Parents are forced to make their own child care arrangements, as public child care facilities are not available in many cases. One of the biggest barriers in accessing child care is cost. Many people, particularly lone parents, earn less than &euro;19,000 per annum. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has estimated that nearly one third of that income is spent on child care before rent or mortgage payments or any other bills.</P>
    <P>Those earning between &euro;19,000 and &euro;24,000 spend an estimated 21% of their income on child care. The ICTU also found that 72% of women who work part time cited child care costs as the reason they work part time. More than 33% of women in the workforce work part time, predominately in the low-paid sectors of employment. How can a mother, who is on the minimum wage, afford to go to work unless we address child care issues?</P>
    <P>While being a Deputy entails long, hard work, it has its benefits. However, there is no great encouragement to Deputies considering starting or adding to their families. There is no maternity leave afforded to Deputies, there is no cr&egrave;che and there are no specific facilities where a mother can breast-feed her child. Politics is not a family-friendly business. It is shameful that in 2004, despite proposals for a cr&egrave;che in Leinster House circulating for many years, there is still no sign of one. Women representatives with children need the full support of a partner who is willing to spend more time at home with the children.</P>
    <P>This is made even more difficult for those who live outside Dublin, as I know. While I do not have a family, if I did, I would probably not be a Deputy. I left home last Tuesday morning at 5.30 a.m. and I will get home tonight at about 11 o&rsquo;clock. The health board would probably take my children into care if I had any, as I would hardly get to see them. If we had a cr&egrave;che here, such a facility would be used not only by the women Members but the fathers, including the Minister of State who also lives far away. I was reared in politics at home. We never saw our father and our mother did all the work. We were lucky our mother was able to stay at home and look after us. We were effectively a one-parent family as our father was out and about. That was back in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it is much the same in 2004.</P>
    <P>If our predecessors in this House had been able to bear children, we would have state-of-the-art facilities. However, unfortunately the majority of those in the House were male. If we want to encourage more women into politics, these issues will need to be addressed. Otherwise, we are only paying lip service to women. Many women are involved in politics at local and branch level. However, those women are discouraged from national politics due to the lack of child care facilities and by being away from home for so long. Even local authorities should hold their meetings at night to facilitate women <Col N="1113"/>representatives to attend when the fathers return home.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about D&aacute;il reform, which is topical and on all our minds, we must be serious about families and we must address these issues. We should not be afraid of the media and what it might say about us. It will be talking about us anyway so we might as well go ahead and do what is best to encourage the best people to stand for election. Most of the benefits gained for women in recent years came, not from Government initiatives, but from the demands of European directives.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Protection Bill 2003 will provide more protection against discrimination for pregnant employees, which is to be welcomed. There is still a cloud of fear hanging over many women when it comes to telling their employers they are pregnant. It is horrifying that this fear is not without grounding. I know of women who are afraid to tell their employers they are pregnant. It is criminal that in this day and age, some women are still being discriminated against by their employers because they are pregnant, despite legislation being in place to protect them. Implementation of this legislation needs to be addressed. There are still employers who believe they can ignore the law and I hope this Bill will send a clear message to them that they flout the law at their peril.</P>
    <P>Laura Fearn was awarded &euro;15,000 by the Equality Tribunal in 2003 after she was found to have been demoted and sidelined for no other reason than she was pregnant. During 2002, the Labour Court reached a decision on 13 dismissal cases. Five of these involved complainants who alleged they were dismissed because they were pregnant. All five cases were upheld with awards of between &euro;6,000 and &euro;15,000, and these are only the cases which were brought forward. There are many women who, out of fear, will not take their case to the Labour Court and this is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I hope that these types of high-profile cases will act as a deterrent to this type of discrimination but unfortunately it continues. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has recommended a fast-track procedure to deal with complaints relating to maternity issues. As we know, such complaints need to be addressed urgently. We also need to extend this anti-discrimination cover to those women who are not represented by a union and who have been employed in an environment where they have felt unable to take action against their dismissal. Unfortunately such cases still occur. While those in a union have that backing, unfortunately there is no union in many workplaces and those women feel very isolated and need our support.</P>
    <P>Women need to be informed of their rights in these cases. Employers have attempted to dismiss a woman who is pregnant under the guise of poor work and this Bill should protect against this practice. However, if women do not know about this protection, it is redundant. We need a broad <Col N="1114"/>information campaign informing women of their rights. The Minister of State should have leaflets printed and placed in health centres, maternity hospitals, doctors&rsquo; surgeries and other such places. Many women, particularly those who are not union members, are not aware of their rights. The Minister should consider a public information campaign.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill acknowledges that many women wish to work as close to their due date as possible in order to have as much of their maternity leave spent at home after the child is born. This will allow new mothers to take 16 weeks of their paid maternity leave after the birth of their child, if they so wish. This is very welcome. I could never understand why the legislation insisted that women take a specific leave before the baby was born. A mother or her doctor would never jeopardise her baby. I am glad it is now up to the woman to make her own intelligent choice and I commend the Minister for implementing this change. Pregnant women are not ill and are able to work up until the day their babies are born.</P>
    <P>For many mothers who work outside the home, they need this time after the birth because many cr&egrave;ches will not take children below a certain age. This should address the problem of women having to take annual leave after their maternity leave.</P>
    <P>During 2002, almost 30,000 women made applications for maternity leave, the vast majority of whom wanted to take their leave after their babies were born.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the so-called provision for breastfeeding mothers, allowing them to take breaks for breastfeeding for up to six months after the birth, without defining how long these breastfeeding breaks will last. These provisions were originally intended to last for four months but the Government has since realised this would be redundant as many women are on maternity leave in the four months after their child&rsquo;s birth. This also raises the question of mothers who bottle-feed their babies. Are they not entitled to the same benefits of as those who breastfeed? Some mothers may not be in a position to breastfeed and they should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>If the measure is to encourage women to breastfeed that is fine, but now that we are debating the long-awaited Bill, can we not deal properly with this matter? The Bill merely pays lip service to breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding until a child is at least two years old. The six-month timeframe set out in this section falls far short of this recommendation. Who is benefiting? Is it new mothers, or is it the Government, patting itself on the back for coming up with an innovative proposal?</P>
    <P>The health and safety provisions contained in the Bill must also be welcomed. This should go some way towards affording pregnant workers the safety in work they deserve. Workplaces can <Col N="1115"/>be dangerous for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Employers are obliged by law to carry out a risk assessment of hazards in the workplace. Who supervises this? Is it enforced? Perhaps the Minister of State could look into this. Have any employers been taken to task for allowing pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to work in unsafe conditions? What proposals has the Department made for ensuring there are personnel to investigate these very important health and safety issues?</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for paid maternity leave to be extended from 14 weeks to 18 weeks, which is one of the minimum amounts of time given to mothers within the EU. Paid maternity leave should be seen by employers as a way of increasing the number of valued employees who return to work after having their babies. It also reduces a company&rsquo;s training and recruitment costs and improves morale within a company. Ireland is still lagging behind its European partners on this issue. Women in Sweden are afforded 96 weeks of maternity leave with one year of maternity leave on 80 per cent pay. The Labour Party believes that maternity and parental leave should be supplemented by a further 20 weeks of paid leave, to be taken by either the father or the mother.</P>
    <P>A survey was recently carried out of 400 parents in France, Italy, Denmark and Ireland. Of the Irish parents surveyed, 90% of men and 86% of women had never taken parental leave. For many, the fact that it is unpaid is the biggest disadvantage. The study, which was co-ordinated by Trinity College, also found that 12% of women always use their annual leave when their childminding arrangements fall through, a further 12% often use this option and an additional 30% sometimes use their annual leave. This represents 54% of parents in our workplaces. The State needs to get its act together in the area of child care provision because there is a crisis. I was pleased to hear that the Minister intended to increase the time allowed for adoptive leave from two to 16 weeks in the adoptive leave (amendment) Bill. Many people are now adopting children from abroad and it is wonderful for parents and children to have this time together.</P>
    <P>If we are being serious about families we need a whole package of reforms across different Departments. There are important issues facing families and parents, new and old. It was different in my day. Now, listening to the news and reading the newspapers every day one frequently hears about children being attacked and raped. Society has broken down for children. We need a wide range of measures within every Department to cope with this. I hope other Departments will follow the Minister&rsquo;s lead in addressing this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which deals with ante-natal classes, is to be welcomed, but it does not go far enough. Both parents should be able to attend, particularly for the last three classes. I appeal to <Col N="1116"/>the Minister of State to consider this. Fathers are now very involved in the births of their children and it is important that both parents attend these classes. I welcome the Bill, although it needs to go further in some sections. I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to this effect.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill, as I would welcome any Bill which seeks to improve the rights and employment conditions of workers. However, it is disappointing that the Bill delivers very little for women seeking to combine motherhood with work. All its provisions are minimal and do not seek to make any real difference to the lives of working women. Once again we have a Bill which is being sold as an achievement of social partnership, although in reality we are simply belatedly giving working women basic rights.</P>
    <P>Maternity protection is at the forefront of the battle to bring about a better work-life balance for workers. In the words of the International Labour Organisation, &ldquo;Maternity protection contributes to the fundamental principle of elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.&rdquo; It is also vital in the battle to combat social exclusion and poverty. The necessity for maternity protection legislation is a recognition that in the workplace pregnant women and new mothers face many barriers. The number of pregnancy discrimination cases that have come before the Equality Authority and the courts in recent years is evidence that many employers have yet to accept the basic principles of maternity protection.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, stated: &ldquo;It is a widely held view, supported by leave arrangements in several countries, that the best interests of infants under 12 months old are served where they remain in the direct care of their parents.&rdquo; It is disappointing that this principal did not guide the Government in the drafting of the Bill. This should have been used as an opportunity to facilitate mothers and fathers in caring for their children in the first years of their lives.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.7-?><P>Maternity policy needs to be centred on the needs of parents and children first and then the employer. Employers&rsquo; organisations seek to dehumanise much employment policy in a way that does not take cognisance of needs and lives of workers. Many employers are hanging on to outdated 19th-century industrialist attitudes, viewing the worker as merely another cog in the machinery of their factories. The responsibility of employers in this regard is well captured in the ILO statement: &ldquo;Reproduction is a function of society [and] women workers should not bear the <Col N="1117"/>burden alone.&rdquo; Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe that the maternity leave provided for in this legislation is adequate. We are calling for the pre-confinement period to be left at four weeks and for the total period of leave to be increased to 26 weeks to allow a greater period of leave after childbirth. This is necessary given the difficulties faced by working mothers today in the area of childminding. If we do not facilitate such an increase in maternity leave we will end up forcing working mothers to leave their employment.</P>
    <P>Breastfeeding is the right of every female worker and this must be facilitated at no loss to the worker concerned. Breastfeeding levels in this State are amongst the lowest in Europe despite the clear guidelines from the Department of Health and Children about its benefits for mother and child. The difficulties faced by workers who wish to breastfeed their babies undoubtedly plays a role in the continuation of these low levels. Other countries have achieved much higher rates through family-friendly initiatives, provision of paid breastfeeding breaks and so on.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we must facilitate the realisation of the right of working mothers to breastfeed. In that regard, I welcome the amendment to the section dealing with breastfeeding provisions. The original provisions in the Bill were widely criticised, including by the national breastfeeding co-ordinator in the Department of Health and Children. The removal of the restrictions on the position of women whose infants are under four months old is welcome. However, many of the provisions on breastfeeding are vague and we will have to wait for the regulations from the Minister to see the detail of what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The qualification that the requirement on the employer to provide facilities for breastfeeding in the workplace does not hold if there are more than nominal costs involved undermines the apparent intention of the Bill, which is to facilitate working mothers who wish to breastfeed. The Bill is flawed in that there is a lack of obligation on employers to provide facilities for mothers and their babies. With regard to the provision of facilities, it is not clear what, if anything, the Bill will achieve. It is also flawed in that the reduction of working hours has not yet been set out or defined. The Bill should contain a simple entitlement to interruption of work for nursing without loss of pay. Any attempt to facilitate breastfeeding mothers in a limited and structured way will inevitably lead to difficulties for the women concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk that this Bill is a step to enable the greater participation of women in the workplace. The reality is that the Bill offers little and, without significant advances in the provision of affordable child care, more women will leave the workforce because there are either no child care places available or what is available is too expensive. Good quality child care must be made available to all, especially to those on low incomes. A universal entitlement to free pre-school must be introduced. The progress on child care to date by the Government has been miserable.</P><Col N="1118"/>
    <P>I wish to make a number of brief points about the provisions on ante-natal classes. The Bill provides that the pregnant worker will not get paid time off to attend the last three classes, on the assumption that the woman is on maternity leave. This is made increasingly unlikely by the fact that the Bill proposes to reduce the pre-confinement period of leave to a minimum of two weeks in theory. Clearly this is a case of the cost for employers being put before the health and safety of the employee. Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to amend this provision on later Stages. In addition, fathers should have the right to attend a full set of ante-natal classes since many fathers want to accompany their partners to such classes. This must be facilitated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has undergone fundamental cultural change in recent years and especially in the years of the Celtic tiger. Members, perhaps with the exception of Deputy English, will remember a time when mothers stayed at home and fathers came home at midday for their dinner. I use the word &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; because that is what the meal was called; it was not called &ldquo;lunch&rdquo;. I am always corrected by my children when I refer to that meal as &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That society was probably the leftovers from de Valera&rsquo;s vision of Ireland, in which the right of the mother to stay at home was enshrined in the Constitution. However, the other side of that was discrimination against the mother who wished to remain in work. We have heard many tales of women in the Civil Service and in the teaching profession who, on getting married, were told that their careers were over.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>That happened to my mother.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Many women experienced this. It was clearly discriminatory.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, when the labour market requires women, the laws can be changed rapidly. During the Second World War, manpower was limited because the men were on the front and women were encouraged back into the labour market. Similarly, in the Celtic tiger era, this country required more women at work so the Government introduced individualisation. That, however, discriminated against women who wished to remain at home. They believed they had not only a right but a duty to do so and that it was best for their children.</P>
    <P>In the Celtic tiger era there are many pressures, primarily economic, on the family unit. The mortgage is one such pressure. At a residents&rsquo; association meeting I attended, one of the people told me: &ldquo;I live in the third mortgage on the right&rdquo;. That is how he sees his life. It is dominated by the mortgage. Two people are required to pay the mortgage. Often, therefore, both parents have to commute long distances and endure long hours at work. They rarely get to see their children and have to pay inordinately high child care costs. This is the reality for many parents at present. Recently, I had the opportunity of visiting a cr&egrave;che in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency. I <Col N="1119"/>was brought there by one of the Green Party&rsquo;s candidates, Patricia Forde Brennan, who is doing good work in Limerick. I listened to the parents. It was a fantastic facility but the parents&rsquo; lives were ruled by the marketplace.</P>
    <P>This legislation has not been drafted with parents in mind. The employers have dictated it, which is unacceptable to the Green Party. Compare our legislation with legislation in Scandinavian countries where there is an entirely different approach. It is child and parent focused. This legislation, however, is primarily about the marketplace. This is reflected in the process of childbirth. Our maternity hospitals are becoming increasingly centralised. In 1970, there were more than 100 maternity units. That is now down to 22 and it is proposed to reduce the number to 12. There is a trend towards further centralisation.</P>
    <P>In the past, many women gave birth at home. I believe there is a strong move against home births, which was recently reflected in the Supreme Court decision. I have always been a proponent of home birth. I believe breastfeeding is encouraged by home birth and by the one-to-one care that the midwife offers. Much good work has been done in this area by Marie O&rsquo;Connor who has shown that there is scaremongering about home births through misleading information. Home births are safe. There should be a change in the 1970 Act to facilitate mothers who wish to give birth at home. They should be given the money to do so. That is real maternity protection. We need to find out what mothers want.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell quoted Deputy John Bruton, whose comments reflect core Green Party philosophy. This is that the contribution made by carers and mothers is never factored into the economic statistics. Somebody who produces nerve gas in a factory is a productive member of society but somebody who looks after children does not receive payment and is not seen as productive. The Green Party views that as false accounting.</P>
    <P>We should listen to what women are saying. If one compares what is offered in this Bill with what is available in other countries, one can see it is inadequate. Even the UK permits 24 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave. Fertility rates are plummeting because working mothers believe that giving birth is no longer an option. This is increasingly the case in Ireland. More than 15% of Equality Authority work relates to maternity leave issues. There are particular problems in small to medium sized enterprises where the constraints on women pursuing their maternity rights are acute. This especially applies to the hotel and catering industries.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to breastfeeding. The four month limit is inadequate. The Minister appeared to be nodding in agreement when the previous speaker mentioned this. There appears to be a lack of joined up thinking in Government on this issue. The Department of Health and Children recommends breast-feeding up to six months. We need to sort out the inherent contradictions on <Col N="1120"/>this issue. The La Leche League&rsquo;s recommendation for a longer period for breast-feeding has not been taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is too loose an arrangement to give employers discretion on breast-feeding breaks given the record of small and medium-sized enterprises in accommodating expectant mothers. There is no guideline on a qualifying time for mothers to take breaks at work. In Sweden, for example, mothers get a 20-minute lactation break every two hours and they are allowed to accumulate time. We have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children invited the La Leche League to address it. It pointed out the problems that occur in regard to breast-feeding on which we have a very poor record. This is possibly the best start one can give a child in terms of building up his or her immune system. We need to encourage breast-feeding through legislation, but, unfortunately, the Bill falls short of what is required.</P>
    <P>Women have referred to the concept of a mother tax; this is a tax on lifestyle, career and income. One in three women in their 20s fear the impact on their career of having a child, while 42% worry about the effect on their finances if they become mothers before they are 30. Almost one in four people in their late 30s do not have children. One in five people in their 30s without children who want them in future are unsure as to when they will have them. These are the realities of living in modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>According to the National Family and Parenting Institute, 57% of mothers with children under the age of five now work, compared with 43% in 1991. More mothers complain of being pushed towards work. Only 1% of women want to work full time when their children are very small. What are we doing about the other 99%? Are we really encouraging them into motherhood or are we encouraging them into the workplace? The answer to that is quite clear. It is regrettable that we are not accommodating those women; that we have moved so far in the ideological direction of the Government. Two thirds of women would prefer to work part time or not at all at this stage of their children&rsquo;s lives. We are falling short in our response to the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin referred to some of the issues arising from the Bill. I am interested to hear how the Minister of State will respond to the issues that have been raised by previous speakers. We are all agreed that to avoid potentially significant health and safety risks, the pre-confinement period of maternity leave should remain at four weeks and the total period of leave should increase to 20 weeks to allow a greater period of leave after the birth to compensate. This is dealt with in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the termination of additional unpaid leave. Again, an employee must have the employer&rsquo;s consent to exercise this right. This could lead to an employee who does not have a contractual right to sick pay in the event of certified medical illness, being prevented <Col N="1121"/>by an employer from claiming that entitlement simply by the employer refusing termination of the leave. This area needs to be examined and I hope this will happen on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>An employee should be allowed to challenge before a rights commissioner an employer&rsquo;s decision to refuse to allow the termination of additional maternity leave. The employer concerned should be obliged to show that there is an operational justification for such a refusal.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with postponement of leave where a baby is hospitalised. The Minister of State dealt with some of these issues in the Seanad. I suggest that the potential right to postpone maternity leave should apply at any point during maternity leave. In addition, a refusal to allow the postponement of such leave by an employer should be open to challenge before a rights commissioner. The employer concerned should be obliged to show that there is a justifiable cause for such a refusal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin referred to ante-natal classes. This is very important and again, we contrast badly in this regard, particularly with Sweden. These classes should be available to pregnant employees without any loss of pay and we must make sure this is the case.</P>
    <P>The legislation needs to go much further. I received many submissions in recent days and while I will not go into them in detail, there is a great deal of disappointment among women that the Bill has not addressed some of the more fundamental questions. It is an improvement but we are only doing so in baby steps, if the Minister will pardon the pun. We are not making the advances which are required to make Ireland a truly equal society and to give women the opportunity, if they wish, to stay at home for longer periods of time to look after their children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. It has taken some time to come before the House due to pressure of business.</P>
    <P>Balancing work and life commitments is important, not only in the context of assisting employees in combining employment and personal responsibilities, but also in underpinning social and equality objectives. It is imperative, therefore, that we meet the challenge of developing innovative measures which reflect the reality of today&rsquo;s workplace and the personal and social responsibilities which employees encounter.</P>
    <P>The increased number of women in the labour force has been one of the main contributory factors in our economic growth which has allowed the economy to expand without being stifled by major skills shortages. In 1994, the female labour force participation rate was only 39%. According to the latest CSO figures, it is now almost 49%.</P>
    <P>The EU Presidency conclusions on equal opportunities and social inclusion as outlined in Lisbon and Nice in 2000 set a target of 60% employment for women by 2010 with an interim target of 57% by 2005. We still have some way to go to meet those figures. It is unlikely that we will <Col N="1122"/>reach 57% by 2005, but I hope we will reach the 60% target by 2010. Complying with these targets will mean a further increase in the number of women of child-bearing age in the labour force.</P>
    <P>Our economic climate is, in itself, a driving force in addressing obstacles to women&rsquo;s participation in the labour force, particularly in skilled employment. Employers do not want to lose trained and skilled women and are looking at ways of retaining them in employment. The need to ensure continued economic growth is putting the employment and retention of women in the workforce at centre stage. This is not only an equality issue but also an economic one. Recent statistics show that, of the number of women in employment in Ireland, more than 62% are aged between 15 and 45. These ages approximately correspond to childbearing age. Almost 30,000 maternity benefit payments were awarded to employed or self-employed women in 2002. In all, 60,000 children were born in the same year.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that our legislation recognises the valuable contribution made by working mothers and provides support for them in the workplace. I am delighted to see the regulations whereby women are entitled to 14 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave but must take four weeks of this before having the baby will be changed under this Bill. Many babies do not arrive on time and can be born up to two weeks&rsquo; late. This can mean that women find themselves going back to work much sooner than intended. The majority of women applying for maternity benefit put false dates on their application forms so that they may spend more time with the baby after it has been born. Everyone that has worked in this area recognises this has been a major problem.</P>
    <P>Last year, almost 30,000 women made applications for maternity leave. The majority of these women wanted to have the maximum time available to them after the birth and want the right to decide when they will take their leave. The four weeks&rsquo; provision was a frustrating regulation and not a defined right. The amending of this will allow new mothers to take up to 16 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave after the birth of their child. It offers greater flexibility in managing leave entitlements in the way that best suits their personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill also strengthens maternity protection rights for breastfeeding employees. Now, mothers will be allowed breastfeeding breaks, or adjusted working hours, for up to six months after the birth of their baby. This puts the welfare of the family ahead of the employer. Breastfeeding provides the best opportunity for a healthy start in life for infants and young children. The incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland continues to be lower than that of our European counterparts. In 1994, only 36% of mothers breastfed their children, although this figure has increased since then. The majority of infants are not breastfed and are therefore deprived on the major nutritional, immunological and psychological benefits breastfeeding confers.</P><Col N="1123"/>
    <P>The evidence for the superiority of breastfeeding for mothers and children is compelling and continues to grow. Research indicates that many of the health enhancing and disease preventative benefits of breastfeeding in infancy are sustained throughout childhood and into adulthood. A baby&rsquo;s first year of life is a time of unprecedented growth and development. Breast milk is specifically designed to optimise the baby&rsquo;s potential during this time and for years after the breastfeeding has ceased. There are health benefits for breastfeeding mothers too, as they have some protection against pre-menopausal breast cancer, ovarian cancer and osteoporosis in later life. Just as importantly, breastfeeding provides unique and precious early bonding experiences for infants and their mothers. This contributes greatly to the baby&rsquo;s psychological, emotional and social development.</P>
    <P>We must offer all women and their families the opportunity to make informed choices about breastfeeding. We must provide support and develop greater awareness of these benefits. We must also look at how barriers to breastfeeding may be overcome. It is essential that the Government does everything to influence and change society&rsquo;s attitude towards breastfeeding. We should aim for a society that offers support and recognises the enormous benefits of breastfeeding. In creating better awareness and support for breastfeeding, the establishment of a national committee on breastfeeding and the appointment of a national breastfeeding co-ordinator were of great importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill increases the support. Many working mothers who would like to breastfeed their children for four months or more have not had the opportunity to do so in the past as they have had to return to work when the baby is around three months old. As a result of this, many mothers give up breastfeeding after the first three months and in some cases decide not to breastfeed at all. According to a recent study, babies who are breastfed develop higher IQs than those who are not and, the longer they are breastfed, the more intelligent they are likely to be. Researchers analysed data from more than 9,000 babies born between 1959 and 1961. The researchers looked at how they were fed as children and recorded their adult IQ. The study found that babies breastfed for two months or longer had a slightly higher IQ than the general population &mdash; the average is approximately 100. Babies breastfed for seven to nine months scored the highest IQs with an average of 106. The American and Danish researchers involved in the study believe the link may be due to the nutrients found in breast milk.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not make women who decide not to breastfeed feel inferior. While it is a personal decision, we should do everything possible to encourage them to breastfeed. This Bill will assist every mother in doing this if she so chooses.</P>
    <P>The institute of obstetrics believes pregnant women need to attend at least one complete set <Col N="1124"/>of ante-natal classes in the interests of her health and safety during pregnancy. Ante-natal classes form an intrinsic part of the ante-natal care package, especially in the woman&rsquo;s first pregnancy. These classes are essential to provide information on all aspects of giving birth so that they can assist each expectant mother on how to make informed choices. Through a wide variety of skills and knowledge, the classes aim to educate the expectant mother and her partner and promote confidence in her ability to give birth. Ante-natal classes provide the expectant mother with information about pregnancy, labour, delivery and baby care. They allow both the mother and her partner to discuss any concerns they might have with other expectant mothers. Many women and their partners find this to be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>While many ante-natal classes focus on labour and delivery alone, more are beginning to include practical advice on how to care for the baby and adjust to parenthood. Childbirth and parenting, especially for first-time parents, can be a daunting and scary time. Ante-natal classes can be exceptionally helpful in preparing future parents for what is ahead of them. This Bill ensures that every expectant mother will be legally entitled to attend those essential classes without loss of payment. It also ensures every father will be able to attend two classes prior to the birth. This will be of assistance to both mother and father during the delivery.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an extremely important measure for the health of the mother and child. It is an important move for many mothers and gives them the entitlements they need and deserve at one of the most important times of their lives. I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

	<P>I thank everyone who contributed to this debate. I thank them for their generally positive remarks and support for the Bill. In the course of the debate, people lost sight of the fact that this legislation is the product of social partnership. It represents a deal worked out between employers, who are naturally concerned to protect their interests and minimise their costs, and the representatives of working mothers, namely the trade unions. While the Government was a party to the agreement, the legislation is the product to the agreement between the employers and the trade unions. When two sides sit down to hammer out a deal, each will try to get as much as they can and minimise their obligations to the greatest extent possible.</P>

    <P>I appreciate the many constructive proposals I have heard. I have received representations from all sorts of people suggesting that the period should be increased or not taken <i>en bloc</i> and that we should have more benefits. While I take on board and appreciate the many constructive proposals I have heard, I am frankly not able unilaterally to unravel that package to give a better degree of <Col N="1125"/>accommodation to one party and less to another. I am not entitled to do so. Deputy Gormley brought up the old chestnut of the Scandinavian countries. Whenever there is a debate on such social issues, we are bound to be beaten over the head at some stage by someone talking about Scandinavian countries. I know of no one in this country who would not like to have the social benefits and system enjoyed by people in the Scandinavian countries. However, having said that, I know very few who would want the rates of tax that people must pay in Scandinavia either. At the present time in our economic development, successful though we may have been in recent years, one cannot have both.</P>
    <P>Deputy English raised the question of retrospection. I would like to clarify something that I indicated to him. The increased periods of leave &mdash; the 14 to 18 and the four to eight &mdash; were brought into effect in 2001. That was done by way of secondary legislation. This Bill brings the statutory instrument into the form of primary legislation. The other provisions will not have retrospective effect. Retrospection is not an issue in that regard. The other regulations will kick into effect only when the Bill commences.</P>
    <P>Deputy English also raised section 5 and whether additional maternity leave should be extended. I remind the House that we also have parental leave. Someone who takes paid maternity leave and additional maternity leave is also immediately entitled, additionally, if she so wishes, to take an additional 14 weeks&rsquo; parental leave, albeit unpaid, as Deputy Moynihan-Cronin has said. However, in this case we are talking about extending the additional maternity leave, which is in any case unpaid.</P>
    <P>Deputy English also raised the question of whether leave might be postponed to be taken in the event of the illness of a child. He is unhappy about the fact that it must be taken in one block. I can look at that, but, as I said, I must be very careful to stay within the terms of the agreement on which this legislation is based. I can answer some of his other points in the same way. He asked about the number of antenatal classes and why fathers could not have extra classes. He also made an interesting observation regarding breast-feeding. If someone is entitled to take a breast-feeding break where no breast-feeding facilities are provided on the job and agrees to go at night to facilitate her employer, she can look for compensation. There is total flexibility, and the employer and employee can work out any deal that they wish. Deputy English also asked where the six-month period was in the Bill. Essentially, a breast-feeding employee is defined in the 1994 Act as an employee up to 26 weeks after her confinement. The 1994 Act and this Bill must be read together. The definition is clear in their conjunction.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It was clearer in the one before. Perhaps I am wrong.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1126"/>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This amends the earlier Act, and anything that is not amended still stands. A breast-feeding employee is defined as an employee up to 26 weeks after her confinement. However, we will re-examine that to ensure it is absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell raised a query about what safeguards will be in place to prevent people from skiving off work on the pretext that they are breast-feeding. This law will be covered by regulations. The sort of evidence that one must produce, which will in any case be fairly clear, will be incorporated into those regulations which are now being prepared. Generally speaking, one currently needs at least a medical certificate. Deputy Mitchell also raised a point about measures to force men to face up to their responsibilities if they leave the family and their wives and kids to fend for themselves, believing that they have no contribution to make. If someone in that situation is working, of course his deserted wife can seek maintenance from him. However, that is not always very effective. Some Deputies, to my surprise, do not seem to realise that, if someone gets a lone parent&rsquo;s allowance &mdash; it is one of the options, and the social welfare authorities may say that he or she is entitled in such cases &mdash; the Department of Social and Family Affairs pursues the other partner &mdash; the father in that case &mdash; to make what it would regard as a reasonable contribution judged on his circumstances. I know from the personal experience of constituents coming to me more frequently with this problem that it seems to be stepping up its campaign, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said that we were lagging behind the rest of Europe. I do not agree with that. Our legislation is already fully compliant with the EU pregnant workers&rsquo; directive, and our statutory entitlements are more generous than those set down in it. For example, the directive provides for 14 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave; we provide 18. We also provide an additional eight weeks of unpaid leave. This Bill further enhances the rights of working women who wish to bear children and remain in work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin also referred to the lack of cr&egrave;che facilities in Leinster House, and I agree with her about that. However, the provision of such facilities is an administrative matter. I am told that it is now up to the newly created Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is tasked with providing for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I believe that she mentioned something about which she is mistaken, though it may also have been another Deputy. Deputies are entitled to maternity benefits. We learn something new every day.</P>
    <P>Several people mentioned child care, and of course this legislation does not deal with that; it has a specific mandate to deal with certain matters. There have been very significant developments regarding the provision of child care over the last few years. Child care was <Col N="1127"/>identified as a priority area for investment in the national development plan and the equal opportunities child care programme 2000 to 2006, which was launched by my Department in April 2000. The principle aims of the programme are increasing the number of child care facilities and places, enhancing the quality of child care services and introducing a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of such services. The total funding allocated to my Department for such purposes during the seven years of the programme is &euro;437 million, a not inconsiderable sum.</P>
    <P>The programme is working to address the child care needs of parents who are working or engaged in training and educational activities through the provision of capital grant assistance to community, not-for-profit organisations and private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. It also offers staffing grants to community-based, not-for-profit organisations which focus on meeting the child care needs of disadvantaged families. It also offers support to the national voluntary child care organisations and other groups working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 1,952 grants to child care providers and community groups approved to date will create 27,955 new child care places and also support over 26,577 existing places on completion of the projects. In addition, another &euro;42 million has been allocated to quality improvement measures, including support for the national voluntary child care organisations in the city and county child care committees. City and county child care committees have been established in 33 city and county areas. They have developed and are currently implementing co-ordinated strategic plans for child care provision in their local area over the period from 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley asked me about the Health and Safety Authority and the provisions for pregnant workers. The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for health and safety issues surrounding pregnancy and breast-feeding. The Health and Safety Authority was represented on the review group which recommended the changes being introduced today. It did not draw attention to widespread abuse or non-compliance with the health and safety provisions of the Maternity Protection Act 1994. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin suggested a promotional leaflet campaign. I know that the Equality Authority will want to do something of that sort once this Bill becomes law, and I will certainly pass on her comments to it. I agree with her on the need to disseminate information. I am constantly amazed at the lack of information <Col N="1128"/>regarding these matters among those entitled to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin also mentioned paid parental leave. The principle of paid parental leave was among issues discussed by the parental leave working group in the course of its deliberations. I understand that some members of the working group expressed concerns about the adoption of new measures which would result in increased costs for employers, especially small employers, given the uncertain economic climate at the time and the need to maintain international competitiveness. Consequently, no agreement was reached on the issue of paid parental leave and the Government has made no commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Department has worked out the potential cost per annum of such a measure. Social insurance payment in respect of parental leave, based on an earnings related maternity benefit rate and a 90% parental leave uptake by women and a 15% uptake by men, would cost nearly &euro;79 million. Public sector employer costs, where the rate of payment for parental leave to public sector employees would in all likelihood be full pay, would be more than &euro;50 million. The cost to the social insurance fund and the Exchequer if parental leave attracted a payment on the same basis as maternity leave is estimated to be in the region of &euro;130 million.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the measure could not be introduced without pain and no commitment has been made on the matter thus far. While I am not inimical to the idea of amending the Bill if it would improve it, I stress that any amendments I accept in the course of Committee and Report Stage debates will have to be within the parameters of the agreement which has been hammered out as I do not have any authority to change them unilaterally in favour of one side or the other. I thank Deputies for their constructive comments and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
