    <Title>Request to Move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the prevalence of the MRSA antibiotic-resistant superbug in our hospitals where we have the EU&rsquo;s worst rates of hospital acquired MRSA; the Dutch search and destroy MRSA policy, which has reduced the incidence of MRSA to 0.3%; and to call for similar measures, greater accountability and better use of existing legislation to combat the increasing threat from MRSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, a study by the Migrant Rights Centre showing that migrant women workers suffer serious exploitation and abuse as domestic servants; the need to inquire into how extensive this abuse is; the need to establish structures to protect workers in this situation; and the need to bring forward specific legislation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to resolve the postal dispute and to ensure payment of moneys owed to postal workers and to ensure the retention of postal services to rural areas are adequate through adequate support of rural Post Offices by An Post and the State and allowing them to provide extra services to rural customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the failure by local authorities and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure <Col N="910"/>proper standards of water supply with 76% of small and medium plants and 50% of larger plants failing to meet standards; and that the Minister be requested to provide a statement on the matter.</P>

	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 15, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations 2004, back from committee; and No. 5<i>a</i>, Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 &mdash; Order for Second and Second and Subsequent Stages.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that (1) No. 15 shall be decided without debate; (2) the following arrangements shall apply with regard to No. 5<i>a</i>; (i) the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3 p.m.; the opening speech of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and that of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; (ii) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, with regard to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children; and (3) the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 January 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 15, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations 2004 agreed? Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 5<i>a</i>, conclusion of Second and Subsequent Stages of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not agreed. While I understand the difficult position in which the T&aacute;naiste finds herself, she is asking the D&aacute;il to undo in one day what her Department has failed to address over 21 months, since it first got legal advice as to the frailty of these provisions.</P>
      <P>We are introducing highly questionable provisions here. We are introducing the concept of retrospective legislation affecting thousands of people. We are introducing the concept whereby an arbitrary date will be introduced so that people cannot take legal action under the pre-<Col N="911"/>existing provisions. These provisions are sufficiently legally questionable, but rushing them through the D&aacute;il in one day without proper debate creates further frailty if they are tested in court. This is no way to do business in this House.</P>
      <P>These are serious matters. The legal trail is complex and needs careful scrutiny by Members of the Oireachtas. The numbers of people in vulnerable positions that are affected are significant. We must take great care in dealing with these provisions, but I do not see the opportunity to take that care in the provisions of this order today.</P>
      <P>The 2001 good news announcement for the over-70s has been found frail by the Comptroller and Auditor General on financial grounds, by the Attorney General on legal grounds and &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate the context of the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that. However, we need to explain the context and it is important we give proper and careful consideration to the issues involved. These are extraordinary issues that the D&aacute;il is being asked to approve in the space of a couple of hours. I cannot accept that this is a proper way to proceed on such an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that whereas it is feasible to make procedural changes by retrospection, it is questionable whether one can retrospectively impose a levy. That is what is being done here because what was deemed to be illegal is now deemed to be legal in the Bill. My understanding is that the Department was advised in early 2003 that there was no legal basis for these deductions. I am also informed that the Department was advised before the receipt of advice from a particular chief executive of a health board, which means that the Department of Health and Children was aware of all this since the early part of 2003.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has come into the House on the last sitting day without giving us an opportunity to examine the implications of this legislation or what it is we are asked to do. We are expected to railroad through all Stages. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Government brought some of this on its own head, in so far as the decision on the over-70s is concerned because the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children was not given an opportunity to assess the cost and implications of it. It was done as a stroke coming up to the general election. He had about 24 hours to try to put together an assessment of the cost. This is one of the costs. It was a typical Fianna F&aacute;il stroke to which the Progressive Democrats happily acquiesced because there was an election to be fought. Now the Government wants us to save the Exchequer a month&rsquo;s outlay to railroad through legislation, the frailties of which we have <Col N="912"/>had no real opportunity to examine. We oppose this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the first time we have warned about the difficulties and problems created by rushing legislation. In this case we are dealing in a retrospective fashion with a complex problem that perhaps could have been anticipated with more thought. The problem with which the Government is grappling is not helped by the conflicting advice and conflicting accounts of how we come to be in this situation. We will not help matters by rushing this legislation through today.</P>
      <P>Will the Government reconsider the adjournment of the D&aacute;il which is due to commence today? It is proposed to take most of January off as well as the end of December. I will be around for the best part of next week and am aware that many other Members will also be here. There is no reason we should not extend the time available to allow for reflection on this matter at the weekend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>Not many would agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that we would come back on Tuesday. I am serious. This is not meant to be some kind of pantomime session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is no laughing matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with a complex matter which relates to major expenditure. I ask that we would not rush it. I hope we can learn lessons from the Government practice of standing at a remove from the operation of nursing homes which indicates a lack of concern and certainly a lack of monitoring. We should learn our lesson and put right what is wrong. At this stage we need more time and I advocate we take time next week as well as today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for taking time to brief the parties in regard to what is proposed. That courtesy must be acknowledged. However, the proposition to take all Stages today of what has been accurately described as complex legislation with complex issues at its core is simply not acceptable. Real and substantive questions need to be addressed, which will not be possible in the course of today&rsquo;s deliberations through Second and subsequent Stages.</P>
      <P>One of the key questions is whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who is a former Minister for Health and Children, was unaware of the South Eastern Health Board&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;legal advice which was being considered for months within his Department.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="913"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise. The question is whether the proposal is opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It may not arise at this point but it must arise in the course of the deliberations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to make that point during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not the way to do business. I have no doubt that flaws will be identified in the legislation that will result in mounting legal costs in the future due to legal challenges. The derisory so-called <i>ex gratia</i> payment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, you are going well outside the debate before the House. I call on the T&aacute;naiste to respond before I put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not be sorry, a Cheann Comhairle. It is the T&aacute;naiste who should be sorry because she will be viewed, and quite correctly, as a very bad Santa by all those to whom this payment is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy. Does the T&aacute;naiste wish to respond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not be sorry, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make it clear that the proposed legislation does not arise as a consequence of the 2001 extension of the medical card. That is legally a fact. That is correct. I will make it clear in my address. This legislation is necessitated by the 1976 regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, the legislation is coming forward on foot of advice from the Attorney General. He also got outside advice from two counsel on this legislation. I agree that it would be desirable to have a longer debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is essential that we have a proper debate.</P>

	<P>For every week we do not have these charges it will cost &euro;2.5 million in health care provision. We want to ensure we have as much provision as possible for the elderly and others in long-term care. We need that &euro;2.5 million per week.</P>

The Fine Gael Party has tabled 11 amendments to the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the other Opposition parties have as many. This is an issue of such importance that, even if temporary provisions are agreed to, as the Government wants, the D&aacute;il should return in early January to put in place proper and robust legislation.</P>

	<P>There are many other elderly people in nursing homes for whom the legislation is grossly inadequate. Many people cannot get into public nursing homes and are forced, despite holding medical cards, to go into private ones. Many of them have to sell their homes to continue in care. There is a need for the D&aacute;il to <Col N="916"/>return in early January to put through systematic and properly thought-out legislation. For that reason, the D&aacute;il should not adjourn for such a long period. If we give the Government temporary cover over the Christmas period, we should be back early in the new year to deal with this issue in a comprehensive and robust way.</P>

	<P>On No. 3, that the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 January 2005, I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P LI="1">To delete &ldquo;26 January&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;12 January&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">For the D&aacute;il to adjourn for so long is an injustice to those Members who have many questions to ask of Ministers, particularly in terms of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill. That democratic opportunity will be denied to Members while the D&aacute;il is in recess. In the meantime, the Taoiseach tries to placate public outrage on several issues, particularly over the hiring of a public relations consultant by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. However, this matter is to be investigated in a non-sitting period. The D&aacute;il should return on 12 January 2005 for the Minister for Transport to make a statement to the House, not unlike the way former Deputy Ray Burke accounted for himself. This investigation cannot <Col N="917"/>be done behind closed doors. This is one of many items that the D&aacute;il must discuss. The nursing home situation, which is full of complex legal problems, also needs to be debated properly. Legislation cannot be rushed and the Government cannot be allowed to be unaccountable. I ask that the House return on 12 January 2005.</P>

	<P>The applause confirms what everyone knows. Paddy Behan is a man of great common sense and good humour. He has tremendous inter-personal skills and he gave great service here for 36 years. I wish himself, his wife, Kathleen, his son, Simon, and his daughters, Orla, Niamh, Aoife and Aisling, the very best of luck for the future. We will certainly miss him in Leinster House.</P>

	<P>I join the T&aacute;naiste in wishing a constituent of mine, Paddy Behan, well. We are also losing two other ushers, Frank Lane and Dessie Edwards, over the Christmas period. These people have brought a very high standard of professionalism to their work in the D&aacute;il. They have seen the good, the bad and the ugly go through the House and they treated everyone with respect, dignity and professionalism. They have created a wonderful tradition in the House, which will remain long after they are gone. I wish them a very happy retirement. I know both Dessie and Paddy whom I see walking the streets of my constituency, Dessie with his dog and Paddy at Clontarf Golf Club. I am sure they will have many activities to enjoy in their retirement. They are full of energy and I am sure they will have an opportunity to advise Members how to conduct themselves in the future if there are consultancy positions available. I have been told they are still members of the rugby team representing the Oireachtas. They will be the main carriers for that important squad. I wish them well. They have been great in the House and I think everyone will recognise the value they brought to our work.</P>

	<P>I cannot recall any former Taoiseach getting the applause in the House that Paddy Behan received, which obviously speaks for itself. I have no idea how he is so youthful looking. I have known him since I was a boy when I came in here just out of short trousers. I had an opportunity last Friday night, with the Ceann Comhairle, to say goodbye to Frank Lane and I now join in the remarks of my colleagues about both Dessie and Paddy and thank them for their tactful and professional service down through the years.</P>

    <Col N="920"/><Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sad day, but it is also one which gives us an opportunity to thank Paddy Behan, Frank Lane and Des Edwards for their unfailing courtesy over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Dessie Edwards will be with us until the end of January when there will be an opportunity to pay tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought Deputy Bruton had knowledge I did not have. Unless we come back before the end of January, we will not see much of him and, therefore, I take this opportunity, on the basis that he might feel neglected during January. However, we can still address the issue then if the T&aacute;naiste is amenable to it.</P>
      <P>The unfailing courtesy over many years of Paddy, Frank and Des had a very settling effect on many new Deputies who came in here, having gone through the fracas of general election campaigns. To come in and be told that one will be able to do the job and to be given the support one needs has a very good influence on the House and democracy, and their influence carries far and wide beyond this House to many of our constituents. Perhaps sometimes they do not appreciate the extent to which their influence and courtesy benefits the country. I pay tribute to them and, on behalf of my colleagues in the Green Party, I thank them for their help over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in paying tribute to Paddy Behan and Frank Lane. Unfortunately, the Friday night event does not allow for out of the city Deputies to attend these events. I wish Paddy Behan and Frank Lane every health and happiness in their retirement. As a new Deputy to this House in 1997, were it not for their courtesy and help it would have been a very difficult place to find one&rsquo;s way around, and a steep learning curve. They were very helpful. I say in all sincerity that they have duly earned the thanks and appreciation of every Member of this House.</P>
      <P>The tributes to Paddy, Frank and Dessie reflect the thanks which is due to all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, because they are not exceptions. The words offered on their future and retirement is a reflection on all the staff to whom I say thanks. I wish them all a very happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Independent group, I wish Paddy Behan and his family well. As a new Deputy, I pay tribute to him because he was one of a number of staff who welcomed us to the D&aacute;il and looked after us very well. He is a good example of a public servant who works with Deputies, Senators and the rest of the staff with whom he had a good and warm relationship. As Deputy Bruton said, he is a constituent of ours and, therefore, I wish him and his family well. I agree with the T&aacute;naiste on the way Paddy, Dessie and Frank treated everyone in the D&aacute;il. On <Col N="921"/>behalf of the Independent group, I wish Paddy and his family well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Paddy worked here for 36 years, for 32 of which he worked continuously without sick leave, which must be a record. He was a real professional in his work. Paddy&rsquo;s courtesy, commitment and dedication in looking after the interests of Members and staff is appreciated by everyone who came in contact with him. On my behalf and on behalf of the Members and staff, I thank Paddy for all his hard work and wish himself and Kathleen very many healthy and happy years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I see from the Order Paper that we are rushing through legislation on health. We also have the final obsequies of previous emergency legislation on electronic voting. There is a salutary tale in that report for the approach the Government takes in rushing through legislation without proper foresight. I do not think the same can be said of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. When the Government presented its legislative programme in April it included nine Bills by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be published in 2004, which has not happened. It appears extraordinary that important items such as the judicial conduct Bill, the coroners Bill, the prisons Bill, the parental leave Bill and so on, which were promised to be introduced before the end of the year, do not now figure as high priorities in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. What is happening in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with its legislative programme? Why is it all falling off the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that the parental leave (amendment) Bill was cleared by the Cabinet recently and I am sure it will be published shortly. A number of Bills in the justice area were delayed because of the priority given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill. I think it is the intention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish as soon as possible many of the Bills mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is taking the Order of Business because she was concerned with the Bill I want to ask her about. The work permits Bill has been promised for six terms and is still not published despite the shameful exploitation we hear about of immigrant workers in domestic service in this country. How soon we <Col N="922"/>forget where we all came from. Some of the stories one hears about the abuse of young foreign women in domestic service in this country are shameful.</P>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What Deputy Rabbitte said is further strengthened by the fact that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told me last month that just under 1,000 work permits had been given out last year for workers in domestic service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. We must stay with the promised legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important issue and I too would like an answer, but I want to raise two matters regarding promised legislation. On the marine services Bill, there is a note saying it is not possible to indicate at this stage when it will be published. We might reflect in the new year on whether there is any point in having legislation on the legislative programme when it says it is not possible to indicate when it will be published. Half the mammals in this country reside in the marine environment, sometimes humans included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the T&aacute;naiste to answer his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not seem to give the matter any priority. Regarding the charity regulations Bill, every time the list is published, that Bill is <Col N="923"/>marked down for the following year. In 2005, will the Bill be noted for the following year or will we see it in 2005?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the T&aacute;naiste to answer his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that a four-month public consultation process is under way and that the Bill will be published next year.</P>

	<P>Which Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

I also wish all the staff of the House a very happy Christmas and thank them for the extraordinary service they provide to the Oireachtas. In particular I wish Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il, a speedy recovery. I wish the Opposition, too, a happy Christmas. I am delighted they acknowledge we deserve a rest. So does the Opposition. People do a job on both sides of the House. The Opposition Members have a difficult job to do as well and they do it with great effect. I wish all Members of the Opposition, the Independent Members and all the staff of the House a very happy Christmas.

It certainly has been a long year and in fairness, we deserve a break. I question whether it needs to be as long as the one proposed.

While we are looking forward to the break for Christmas we have an important year ahead of us. My hope going into this Christmas holiday is that 2005 will see the realisation of many of our hopes, certainly as regards matters we have addressed specifically during the course of this week on the resumption of normal political engagement in the north of the island.

If I have a complaint about Members, it is that many of them do not take sufficient time off to look after their own health. I appeal to Members to take some time off, to relax, rest and enjoy themselves with their families. Again, I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a very pleasant and successful 2005.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the debate on this Bill in the House today, I believe it is important that we address the issues with clarity, purpose and fairness. It is important that people in long-term care and their families should have clarity about how care will be provided and paid for. It is important, too, that any charges made by the State are on a fully legal basis, as it is that we should have confidence in our public administration operating effectively in the public interest at all times. It is important, too, that where mistakes are made, they are recognised, responsibility is taken and the lessons are learned and applied.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with three areas, the provisions of the Bill, the scheme of repayments the Government will put in place and the issues arising from the handling of this question within the <Col N="929"/>Department of Health and Children. I am placing on the record of the House a number of documents as an annex to my prepared remarks. I am putting all the facts I know before the House. This is the only way each of us can form clear and fair assessments.</P>
      <P>I wish to introduce formally the Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 to the House. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal framework for the charging of patients in long-term care in health board run institutions and publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes. The Bill will establish a sound legal basis for the long established practice of health boards charging for the costs of maintenance in institutions providing long-term care.</P>
      <P>Most people accept that it is fair and reasonable that those who can afford to contribute to the cost of their long-term care should do so. This has been implemented by successive Governments, and by Ministers for Health from all parties, since 1954. The charges raised are used to support the provision of care for those in long-term residential care. These charges currently generate approximately &euro;100 million for health boards each year. The cost of long-term care is clearly more than this amount. The loss of this income would have an adverse effect on our ability to provide the health and caring services people need.</P>
      <P>I am circulating to Deputies a brief background note on the history of the legislative basis on which charges have been raised up to now. I am also circulating a report by the Secretary General of my Department, prepared at my request for the Government meeting on Tuesday. The basis for charges, made since the McInerney Supreme Court judgment of 1976, arose from a circular issued by the then Department of Health to health boards. This circular, which is included in the annexed documentation, authorised a practice by which the CEO of a health board could regard patients as not meeting the criteria for full eligibility while remaining in long-term care, on the basis that the necessary GP and surgical services were being provided for them. The decision to withdraw medical cards and full eligibility in this manner was taken to enable a charge for inpatient services to be raised under the 1976 regulations, which provided for charging for people other than those with full eligibility. The extension of full eligibility in 2001 to all persons over 70 years of age, irrespective of means, was not the reason the practice of charging in this way was found to be without a sound legal basis. The flawed basis for charges for anyone with full eligibility goes back to the 1976 circular which continued to be implemented after the 2001 decision.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for an amendment to section 53 of the Health Act 1970 as follows. It replaces the existing enabling provision in subsection (2), which provides the Minister with discretionary power to make regulations, by a provision which requires the Minister to make regulations in order to impose charges on all persons, that is, <Col N="930"/>those with either full or limited eligibility. A new subsection (3) is inserted which specifies the categories of person exempted from charges imposed under subsection (2). A new subsection (4) is inserted which empowers the chief executive officer of a health board to reduce or waive a charge having regard to the financial circumstances of the person and with a view to avoiding undue financial hardship for that person. It is intended that the regulations will impose a maximum weekly charge of &euro;120, which is approximately 80% of the weekly rate of the maximum level of the non-contributory old age pension. The regulations will also make clear that individuals are to retain a minimum amount of pocket money of &euro;35 per week. A new subsection (5) is inserted to provide, among other things, that charges levied under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 prior to 14 December 2004 are and always have been lawful. My Department is satisfied, in the light of legal advice available to it, that this is constitutional and in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Department has received advice from the Office of the Attorney General which includes advice from outside counsel including Dr. Gerard Hogan Senior Counsel, a leading expert in Irish constitutional law and a co-author of Kelly&rsquo;s The Irish Constitution. A new subsection (6) is inserted to provide that the retrospective regularisation provision of the new subsection (5) does not apply in the case of a charge which is the subject of civil proceedings instituted on or before 14 December 2004 for the recovery of the relevant charge. A new subsection (7) is also inserted to provide that the provisions of the new subsection (5) do not affect any other ground which may be raised in civil proceedings to debar the recovery of the relevant charge. A new subsection (8) is inserted to make it clear that any current regulations remain in force. This is to make it clear that the Bill does not interfere with other existing regulations. A new subsection (9) is inserted to provide that the charges shall only apply for inpatient services after a period of 30 days or periods aggregating 30 days within the previous 12 months. The new subsection (9) also limits the weekly charge to an amount that does not exceed 80% of the maximum of the weekly rate of the old age, non-contributory pension. A new subsection (10) is inserted to clarify that the period of 30 days referred to in subsection (9) begins to run immediately the person concerned is provided with inpatient services. A new subsection (11) is inserted to define &ldquo;in-patient services&rdquo; for the purpose of charges made.</P>
      <P>These provisions of the Bill implement the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area, which is that it is reasonable that charges should be made, that charges must be on a sound legal basis and that clarity is brought to charges made in the past so as to avoid needless litigation and potentially large instability in health care funding. As I said at the outset, mistakes made should be recognised and redress should occur if at all possible. The <Col N="931"/>Government recognises that a mistake has been made for 28 years on the legal basis for charges. Notwithstanding the fact the policy had consistent support and that people did actually receive a benefit for their payment, the Government believes that some repayment should be made because a mistake was made. It is clearly beyond our financial and administrative ability to repay all charges since 1976. We have therefore decided, by way of a goodwill gesture, to make repayments to people with full eligibility who have paid charges to date. Approximately 20,000 people will benefit from this repayment. Each person will receive a repayment of up to &euro;2,000. These payments will be made automatically, where possible, as soon as possible in the New Year. We will also advertise to allow people to apply for a payment. This is to ensure that no-one who has made payments is left out, or is unduly delayed in receiving payment. For example, there may be people who may previously have been in long-term care but have since left or moved to another setting and records may not be as readily available. The Government believes this is a reasonable and fair way to recognise that a mistake was made. People who are now in long-term care will benefit directly and exclusively. Administrative and legal costs will not absorb any part of the repayment and it will be done speedily and fairly.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2002, the South Eastern Health Board, in the context of a number of claims about charges by and against the board, obtained legal advice on a range of issues related to long stay care in both public institutions and private nursing homes. An extract from the legal advice was handed to the Department at a meeting with the South Eastern Health Board on 11 March 2003. The broad content of the advice was also made known by the South Eastern Health Board to the CEOs of the other health boards. The relevant aspects of this advice were considered within the Department over the following months. It was not, however, brought to a particular decision point during this period.</P>
      <P>The charges for long-term stays in public institutions were discussed in some detail at the end-year review meeting between the Department&rsquo;s senior management and the CEOs of the health boards on 16 December 2003. I am circulating the minutes of that meeting to the Deputies. It was concluded at the meeting that it would be necessary for the Department to get a definitive legal assessment as the first step in drawing up legislation on eligibility and charges.</P>
      <P>Arising from that meeting, a small group was convened within the Department to prepare a position paper on the legal issues surrounding charges for long stays in public institutions. This position paper was drawn up at the end of January 2004, as was a letter to the Office of the Attorney General requesting legal advice that would have been signed by the Secretary General. Unfortunately, this letter was not sent at that <Col N="932"/>time. Following questions on the issue from Deputies Kenny and Perry in the House in October 2004, I immediately sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The legal advice provided on 5 November made it clear to me that new primary legislation would be required urgently to underpin a policy that requires persons to contribute to their costs of maintenance, costs such as shelter, food, bed and clothing, in a public institution or a contract bed in a private setting.</P>
      <P>In light of that advice, work began immediately in the Department on the preparation of the necessary legislation. I made it clear in this House that we would bring in legislation before Christmas if possible. I received further advice on 8 December from the Attorney General on legal problems arising from continuing to make such charges. On foot of that advice, a letter was issued on my instructions to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking them to stop making such charges immediately, pending the introduction of amending legislation. The CEOs of the health boards confirmed last Friday that they had taken the necessary steps to do so.</P>
      <P>Drafting of the legislation continued between the Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and, when it was completed, I was in a position to bring a memorandum to Government last Tuesday. That is how we have come to today&rsquo;s debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Clearly, serious issues arise from how this important legal issue was handled in the Department of Health and Children. The Government proposes to deal with the charges by new law and by making <i>ex gratia</i> repayments. There is also a responsibility on us to deal with public management and administration issues. I have asked Mr. John Travers, a retired head of Forf&aacute;s with a distinguished career in the public service, to examine the management of this issue in the Department and, in particular, the reasons the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was not sought at the earliest possible time. I will ask him to identify lessons that can be learned and applied from these events, in the interests of more effective public administration in the Department of Health and Children and elsewhere. I intend to give him the greatest latitude possible for recommendations in this regard and I expect to receive his report by 1 March next year. I will publish the report.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in blame. I am interested only in achieving excellence in public administration, in the interests of patients, public and staff. There is every reason for the Department of Health and Children to strive for and to achieve excellence, particularly at this time of change when its role will be more focused on policy, legislation and evaluation. I look forward to this report helping us to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The legislation before the House today will bring clarity to an area which has not operated on a sound basis for nearly 30 years. This is a genuine attempt to correct that flaw so that <Col N="933"/>charges for long-term care will now have a sound legal basis. This Bill will ensure that the income from charges will continue to support the provision of quality services to those in long-term care. If we do not allow this funding to be retained, the loss of resources for the health services is estimated to be approximately &euro;8 million to &euro;l0 million per month. It has been accepted that these charges, as contributions to the cost of care, are fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>There are two issues at stake, as far as I am concerned. One is bad government and the second is how we treat the elderly. I am disappointed with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s approach in her speech. She tries to put some blame on the elderly for the cost they will impose on the Exchequer and implies that there will be a reduction in other health services if this problem is not sorted out now and if the State has to repay the elderly patients the charges that were made illegally on them for years. If we do not push this legislation through the House today, somehow they will cause problems for the rest of the health service. That is most unfair.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste also said she did not wish to blame anybody and that we must examine public administration. This was not a problem with public administration. It was a problem with how the Government considered the issue when it was raised. There is no need to go back to 1976. There might be a need to do so when one is framing legislation but there is no such need when examining how this matter was messed up, which is what happened. The many fine words we have heard from this Government on care of the elderly were simply that, fine words. The Government is not really committed to giving the elderly a fair chance. That is why I am even more disappointed, therefore, when the T&aacute;naiste seeks to blame the elderly for this problem.</P>
      <P>According to today&rsquo;s media reports, if patients were able to stand up for themselves, the health boards did not charge them. The health boards have been making a decision on this issue for at least two years. Anybody who protested against the charges was not charged. The patients who said nothing or who were not strong enough to stand up for themselves were charged. It was the poor and the vulnerable on whom the charges were imposed by the health boards. The T&aacute;naiste did not make that clear.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, who published 140 reports, admitted that when he received the 80 page legal document he did not read it. He did not even ask his departmental officials if there was anything in it that might be of concern. Of all the reports published by that <Col N="934"/>Minister, this report had the potential of incurring a charge of &euro;8 million per month on taxpayers but he did not consider it necessary to read it. The character Del Boy in &ldquo;Only Fools and Horses&rdquo; has an appropriate saying for this, although I am not sure if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me to refer to a Minister as a &ldquo;plonker&rdquo;. It is terrible behaviour on the part of a Minister to admit that he never bothered to read the report, especially when the health boards were pressuring him and the Department to give them a clear and defined direction on these charges. The report was ignored.</P>
      <P>What happened since this issue was raised? Deputy Kenny raised the matter in the House on 27 October. The T&aacute;naiste did the right thing and sought advice on it straight away. However, there have been contradictions since then. What about retrospection? The Taoiseach only responded to Deputy Kenny on 7 December although it must have been a topical issue in the Cabinet before last Tuesday. The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;As I understand it, there will be no retrospective element in the legislation.&rdquo; Later, he continued: &ldquo;To deal with this issue we must have primary legislation. There is no retrospective factor in the legislation which is never the case anyway &mdash; we do not have retrospective legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The length of time we have been given to examine the Bill has been too short to have any discussion of it with other parliamentarians, to seek legal opinion or even to allow outside interests to express their views on it. The Bill was only published yesterday morning and we are expected to rush it through the House before 3.30 p.m. Numerous people have tried to contact me to offer their opinions on the Bill but we simply cannot discuss it. There is no time.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said about retrospection. Apparently, this case is unique because of the amounts of money and the number of people involved. The Minister could be challenged on this legislation in court. She should clarify if the legislation is watertight or if we will be back in the House in a few months discussing it again. That appears to be the case from the legal advice we have seen. Given that the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was the Attorney General in 2001, perhaps it is not surprising that the then Minister, Deputy Martin, sought advice from him. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been quite good at re-introducing legislation to the House as well. It has been happening continuously in the House for the past two years, which is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I cannot say much on the legislation at present. We are extremely disappointed with how it is being pushed through the House. It is difficult to give an opinion on where this legislation will lead. We are aware of the Minister&rsquo;s intention. She is trying to clamp down on the illegal charges that were imposed on patients in public nursing homes since 2001. When the T&aacute;naiste responds she should focus on 2001. That was the year this issue was raised. The huge charges involved started in <Col N="935"/>2001. The T&aacute;naiste should try to find out the charges that were incurred by the taxpayer prior to and after 2001. There will be a significant difference between them.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste is trying to muddy the waters a little by referring back to 1976. From a legal point of view she is correct to refer back to 1976 but this originates in 2001 and in the way this Government operates, the inefficiencies and the lack of accountability. That is the year the health boards became concerned about these charges and wrote to the Department about them. It is disappointing that the then Minister decided to ignore the issue but when the health boards made their own decision on it, which was that if somebody complained or raised the issue with them they would not charge those patients, it was a tacit admission by the health boards that it was wrong. Why was this not raised at ministerial level? That is disgraceful.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is a disgraceful way of governing and a disgraceful way to treat elderly patients. It was discrimination between those who could stand up for themselves and those who could not. The patient population involved is made up of elderly and vulnerable people, who need us to stand up for them. As the T&aacute;naiste knows well, all patients have difficulties dealing with health services. Many are intimidated by the way the service operates and the manner in which they are treated. For the House to treat patients this way is absolutely disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Perry, to whom I will hand over, on the hard work he has done in this area. If it were not for his hard work and the pushing of the issue in the House by Deputy Kenny, the current regime would have been allowed to continue. It might have been another ten to 15 years before we saw the Government rush through another Bill to clean up another mess. When the T&aacute;naiste explains the matter, she should be more clearcut on the issues I have raised. We are being misled to a degree by what is being said in the House. A certain amount of spin came through in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech. We need more clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Twomey for sharing time. I give credit to the T&aacute;naiste for acting decisively on the issue in the time since it was raised by Deputy Kenny at the end of October. In her contribution, the T&aacute;naiste outlined clearly the background to the current difficulties. I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts when it was proposed to extend medical card provision to the over-70s. The Comptroller and Auditor General produced a report which indicated the proposal was ill-thought out. It constituted an election ploy which when introduced by the IMO quadrupled the cost of servicing medical cards. The number of cards which would be required was underestimated by 39,000 as the Department could not calculate the number of over-70s who would qualify. Whereas the original <Col N="936"/>estimate was &euro;19 million, the regime currently costs approximately &euro;60 million.</P>
      <P>The legislation introduced to give effect to the provision of medical cards to all persons over 70 years was seriously flawed. It is clear that in legislation health boards were not legally entitled to extend full eligibility to people over 70 or to seek a contribution from them. The 2001 Act introduced for the over-70s confers clearly full eligibility to free inpatient services. Unlike previous legislation, it does not allow for eligibility to be diminished or for charges to be levied. Consequently, since the introduction of the Act, these charges should not have been levied on persons over 70 to whom medical cards have been issued. Charges should not have been levied for long-term care in community nursing units, district hospitals and private nursing homes in which the State has contracted beds for the provision of long-term care.</P>
      <P>I refer the T&aacute;naiste to section 45 of the Health Act 1970, which is important in the context of the case she has made with reference to the 1976 Act. The provisions of section 45 of the 1970 Act permit the levying of charges and were upheld by the Ombudsman in 2002. According to the section, a chief executive officer of a health board is empowered to decide that a person unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself or for his or her dependants shall have full eligibility for health services. A chief executive officer shall, under the section, make a decision subject to his or her assessment of the means of the person on an individual basis and, if approved, will issue a medical card as evidence of full eligibility. Section 52 of the same Act provides that a health board shall make available inpatient services to a person with full eligibility. According to section 53, the provisions of which can be said to apply under the 2001 Act, charges shall not be made for inpatient services made available under section 52. Section 53 allows the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations providing for the imposition of charges on persons who are not persons with full eligibility specifying the amounts of the charges or the limits to the amounts of the charges to be so made.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976, the Minister decided a charge towards the cost of inpatient services provided under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 may be made on a person who is not a person with full eligibility where the person has no dependants and has been in receipt of inpatient services for 90 days or a period aggregating in total 90 days within the previous 12 months. This is the provision according to which charges were allowed to be levied. Under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987, the Minister decided the 90-day limit should be reduced to 30 days.</P>
      <P>This is the body of legislation which provides for the charging of persons in long-term care. It <Col N="937"/>is important to record that the Ombudsman confirmed independently that this was the appropriate legislation in his annual report for 2002. I refer the T&aacute;naiste to extracts from the Ombudsman reports of 2001 and 2002 in which details of refunds are outlined. Refunds were made on the basis of the body of legislation to which I have referred. The Ombudsman confirms the legislation as the appropriate legislation for the imposition of charges.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, a person admitted to long-term care who does not have full eligibility or dependants will, after 30 days, be charged by the hospital a daily amount based on his or her assessed income less an amount the person is allowed to retain as personal pocket money. This income is used to fund services at the hospital to reduce the need for State funding. Persons assessed to have full eligibility while living in the community may have that eligibility withdrawn 30 days after admission to long-term care. This is done on the basis that the hospital is providing fully for the person&rsquo;s medical needs thereby removing the undue hardship criteria. Up to 2001, a chief executive officer had the power to decide to diminish the status of a medical card and impose a charge.</P>
      <P>I appreciate fully that the T&aacute;naiste has come to the House and made a very frank statement and provided the back-up documentation. Clearly, the circumstances in question developed on the watch of the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, who received an 80-page report on the matter. The circumstances should be considered in the context of our talk of caring and sharing. The people in question worked tirelessly to build the State and are on low incomes yet chief executive officers were given the power to reduce the status of their medical cards to hold on to their pensions.</P>
      <P>I will move two amendments on Committee Stage which I hope the T&aacute;naiste will examine carefully which seek to ensure that within three months of the passing of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 the Minister for Health and Children shall lay a report before each House of the Oireachtas detailing the merits and feasibility of establishing a centralised patient database to be used by every hospital and place of care. As such databases have not been available in hospitals, bad management has led to cases in which the next of kin of persons have found funeral expenses could not be met. In health boards where no records were kept, people in many cases had to depend on the death grant. That is hardly good enough given our talk of caring and sharing. The people in question were on pensions of &euro;160, which is why I am delighted the T&aacute;naiste is providing for the minimum retention of &euro;35 per week.</P>
      <P>I will also seek to provide on Committee Stage that within three months of the passing of the Act, the Minister for Health and Children shall lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas detailing the merits and feasibility of providing <Col N="938"/>for the creation of contracts between a caring establishment and next of kin. It is important to make such a provision as it is a sad fact of life that there are cases where fragmentation has occurred in a family of five or six people and no one wants to take responsibility for a person in care.</P>
      <P>When I was its Chairman, the Committee of Public Accounts received numerous letters from next of kin who were completely disgusted by the management of patient accounts within institutions. I hope the T&aacute;naiste will study carefully my amendments in the context of the extent of the Government&rsquo;s error in its inability to calculate the number of persons aged over 70 in the State. While the T&aacute;naiste might be able to provide me with statistics on the exact number of persons in State beds, we require accuracy, accountability and transparency on pensions and incomes.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste must realise that welfare payments are now being paid through health boards and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who is in the Chamber, will confirm that. We are not talking about pensions now but the level of payments channelled through health boards. We need transparency in this matter. We also need a database and someone familiar with accounts to deal with this area. I hope the Minister will deal with my Report Stage amendments effectively.</P>
      <P>On the legality of the charge, persons who were assessed as having full eligibility while living in the community had that full eligibility withdrawn on admission to long-term care not later than 30 days after admission on the basis that the hospital was providing for the person&rsquo;s full medical needs, thereby removing the undue hardship element. That approach was in conformance with the law up to 2001 but the decision to grant full eligibility to persons aged 70 and over from 1 July 2001 has created this problem. According to the amendment to the Act, under section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, section 45 &mdash; this is the critical section &mdash; of the Health Act 1970 was amended. With all the intelligentsia, advisers and legal opinion in Government, how did the Government get it so wrong? Several amendments were made to the 1970 Act but that Act was amended in 2001 to include the provision that a person who is not less than 70 years of age shall have full eligibility by virtue of his or her age. Such a person can never have full eligibility withdrawn. I am focusing my case solely on those aged 70 years and over. The medical card was brought in to give them full eligibility, with no means test, regardless of income. Even millionaires would get full medical expenses paid. This was the case where the Irish Medical Organisation went to Government and got three times the rate to service that card. That card gave full eligibility and that entitlement could not be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wheeling this back to 1976 but I am talking about people aged 70 and over in State contract beds in community district <Col N="939"/>hospitals, community nursing units and private nursing homes. The Minister should do the calculation on those, and I can give her the figures. Under the current law, it is illegal to levy a charge for inpatient services on anyone aged 70 years and over. That is based on the amendment to the 1970 Health Act.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a serious situation here and the report outlines the number of patients in care who qualify under that law. We are talking about those aged over 70 who are the most vulnerable in society. This is supposed to be a caring and sharing Government but this was an illegal charge. The Government is now saying that the banks should refund the money if an illegal charge was imposed.</P>
      <P>Giving people a &euro;2,000 contribution towards their accommodation costs is not good enough. I respect what the T&aacute;naiste is trying to do in theory. She is being very frank and open with regard to this situation but we are talking about an amendment to the 1970 Act, which became law in 2001, giving full eligibility to everybody over the age of 70. Those are the people to whom I refer. They are the people who are legally entitled to a refund. Regardless of the legal derogation the T&aacute;naiste introduced yesterday, there will be a challenge to this action in the courts. People aged 70 and over who were given full eligibility will have remit to go to the courts to get a total refund. They have been let down by this so-called caring and sharing Government. I doubt if the caring and sharing approach being taken here today has got the Inchydoney approval.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5" >We listened to the Minister defend the indefensible in her contribution. It is an appalling record of this Government. This issue was staring it in the face and it did nothing about it. Deputy Perry in particular underestimates his role in all of this. Were it not for Deputy Perry and Deputy Kenny, the issue would not have reached the floor of the House and, in all likelihood, the Minister would not have said anything about it today. At some point in the future the issue might have been addressed but there is no evidence that anybody is being up-front. The Government was caught out and it is now rushing legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she has attached all the facts and information available to her but she has not <Col N="940"/>done that. She has not attached the legal opinion that we should we see, and that I have requested. I want to see the legal opinion that was available to the Minister for Health and Children in early 2003 from the South Eastern Health Board that we now know extended to 80 pages. That should be attached to the speech, along with the legal advice from the Attorney General. It would be interesting also to attach the position paper that was prepared but never acted upon in the Department.</P>
      <P>I found the Minister&rsquo;s contribution quite harsh. She referred to sensitivity being important in dealing with any legislative change in respect of the elderly. Most people would agree with her on that score but these are very serious matters that are her responsibility, ultimately, to address yet we have not had a word of apology. These people in long-term residential care do not have power. They are mentally ill, disabled and elderly. They do not have the power to change history, like Reverend Ian Paisley, but Reverend Ian Paisley got his apology. These people got an outline of what happened, in part, and no expression of remorse. That is very disturbing. An apology would have been appropriate and would not have compromised the Minister, rather it would have put what happened in the right context.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being rushed through the House without proper preparation and debate and without consideration of its constitutional implications. It arises because of a failure by this Government to address an injustice that consisted of the State raiding the pockets of the elderly and the infirm. In fact, the Bill adds to the injustice exerted upon these people by declaring that the charges levied against them are and always were legal, even though we know that is not true. They are and they were illegal. Not content with mugging the elderly once, the Government is now intent on mugging them twice and the Minister, Deputy Harney, is trying to soften the blow by returning a paltry amount of the stolen money to its rightful owners.</P>
      <P>This issue could and should have been dealt with either in 2001, when I understand the Government was made aware of the issue arising, presumably, out of the over 70s scheme or in early 2003, when the South Eastern Health Board provided full legal opinion to notify the Minister for Health and Children of the problem, but nothing happened. It was not even referred &mdash; and the Minister confirmed this today &mdash; to the Attorney General. The Minister has a duty to tell us the reason nothing was done in such a serious matter. It is clear that even when the Department was alerted about this information and did nothing about it, it was supposed to be dealing with the growing evidence that the illegality of the charges was already well-known. At health board level, the pattern appears to have been that when elderly residents were compliant, the money was taken from them and when they resisted, it was not. When a resident went to the Ombudsman, the money was invariably returned. <Col N="941"/>We know from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on nursing home subventions the extent of the money denied illegally to elderly residents of nursing homes and, in that instance, I understand the Attorney General also said the money did not have to be returned and restitution did not have to be made. Nevertheless, it was made. The Minister needs to explain to the House why restitution is not being made in this situation.</P>
      <P>Health professionals providing care for elderly people are concerned about what may happen to their elderly patients who are rehabilitating in long-stay units. An elderly person might remain in an acute hospital for quite a long time with no question of his or her medical card being removed. However, it is uncertain what will happen to such a person recovering in a long-stay unit for more than 30 days. Presumably, such a person will be charged. This will create difficulties for people who are inappropriately placed in acute hospitals. We support the Minister&rsquo;s attempts to deal with the accident and emergency crisis but the key to those efforts is to ensure the smooth transfer of patients to step-down facilities. We need to hear more about the effect of the legislation on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill defines, for the first time, inpatient care with regard to the maintenance of the person. Until now, no such legal mechanism existed. We are being asked to do something quite significant, but in a manner which allows for no scrutiny. The Bill is being rushed through to be got out of the way before Christmas and to save money. There is to be no proper parliamentary scrutiny or consultation. We are being told that &euro;2,000 is to be paid to everyone affected. This is intended to keep everyone quiet, although the measure is not even included in the Bill. That amount is roughly the equivalent of 16 weeks of care. In most cases, more than &euro;6,000 per year was taken from these people but they will only receive a fraction of that amount. When banks overcharged their customers, the Government, the Minister for Health and Children in particular, was very clear about proper practice in the private and commercial sector. Customers were assured of full restitution. When taxes are unpaid, the Revenue Commissioners get full restitution with penalties. However, when the Minister for Health and Children presides over an overcharging regime affecting 20,000 vulnerable people, she considers it unnecessary to do the right thing and make restitution.</P>
      <P>With regard to this partial payment, since each individual has already been identified as a target for the extraction of money, there must be no question of any unnecessary form filling. These are known individuals and they also happen to be elderly, frail, mentally ill or disabled people who should not be subjected to any kind of bureaucratic demand.</P>
      <P>Shaky emergency legislation is being rushed through the D&aacute;il because no one appears to have learned from experience. I cite the experience of the married women&rsquo;s equality issue. In that case, <Col N="942"/>rushed legislation did not work and the issue ended up in Europe. Ultimately, married women were paid £550 million, which was not an insignificant amount of money. Nevertheless, the State paid it, and rightly so, and the country was not bankrupt as a result.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 53 of the Health Act 1970. The effect of sections 52 and 53 of that Act, taken together, is that persons with full eligibility cannot be charged for inpatient services, meaning institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto. This prohibition extends to long-term residential stay and this is the prohibition which was, effectively, ignored in the regulations under which charges were imposed. The Government now concedes that the regulations are unlawful. The charges were levied without statutory authority. If a court were seized of the issue, it would declare the regulations to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Act and they would be held to be a legal nullity invalid from the day they were made. A separate set of institutional assistance regulations made under an earlier Health Act were continued in force and suffer from a similar invalidity.</P>
      <P>Those who had paid money on foot of demands made without statutory authority would, if nothing were done, be entitled to sue for their money back. Their claims would presumably be covered by the Statute of Limitations and limited to six years&rsquo; arrears. If all 20,000 residents had been so resident for six years and had been paying the current rate of &euro;120 per week, the figure would be approximately &euro;750 million.</P>
      <P>The essential purposes of the Bill are to authorise charges in the future and to declare previous charges to have been legally imposed. The new section 53(5) of the Health Act 1970 as inserted by section 1 of this Bill states: &ldquo;It is hereby declared that the imposition of a relevant charge is, and always has been, lawful&rdquo;. A relevant charge means a charge imposed under regulations made under the new section 53(2) of the Act as inserted by section 1 of the Bill and paid at any time before the enactment of the new section 53(5).</P>
      <?oasys _ic20-?><P>So far as retrospection goes, the only specific constitutional prohibition relates to declaring Acts to be infringements. Article 15.5 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo; Retrospectively validating an invalid provision where those subsequently found to have been in breach of that provision, even at a time when it was invalid, are nonetheless exposed to liabilities for their infringement of the law is prohibited by Article 15.5. A health board recovers an unpaid charge as a simple contract debt rather than through the criminal process. Section 74 of the Health Act 1970 states: &ldquo;Any charge which may be made or con<Col N="943"/>tribution which may be levied by a health board under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970, or regulations thereunder may, in default of payment, be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person in respect of whom the charge is made, from the person&rsquo;s spouse (if any) or, in case the person has died, from his legal personal representative.&rdquo; Although the charge would be recoverable if it were a simple contract debt, it is not a contract debt because there is no contract. The action is for the recovery of a statutory charge imposed pursuant to ministerial regulations in respect of the provision of public services by a public body. Even if the payment of the charge were simply a matter of contract, the imposition of a charge makes non-payment a breach of that contract. It would follow that non-payment is, thereby, to be classed as an infringement, breach or contravention of the civil law.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
      <P>It follows that what the Bill seeks to do, in seeking to make the charges valid necessarily also involves making civil court proceedings for the recovery of unpaid charges valid, which could only be so if non-payment of outstanding charges infringed the civil law. This is to create an infringement of the law with retrospective effect and is unconstitutional. There might be difficulties in finding a plaintiff with <i>locus standi</i> to make this point in a challenge to the Bill. A good potential plaintiff would be someone with unpaid bills which the health board was seeking to recover.</P>
      <?oasys _ic20-?><P>However, we are concerned with the validity of the Bill in terms of general principle and it is important that we consider constitutional issues. Non-payment of outstanding charges is not something which could ground an action for their recovery today. The action would fail since the charges were invalidly imposed. However, it is claimed by the Government that such an action would succeed at the end of this week and that the defendant would become liable to a health board on foot of a judgment secured as a result of a breach of a statutory obligation to pay. This is implicit in the Bill. One cannot retrospectively declare charges always to have been valid to justify holding on to money already collected without, by necessary implication, also retrospectively declaring that non-payment of those charges always gives rise to a cause of action on the part of health boards as a breach of a statutory obligation and an infringement of the law by the recipient who is in default of payment. This legislation is in conflict with Article 40.3 of the Constitution, which requires the State in its laws to respect and, as far as is practicable, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen. In particular, it must by its laws protect its citizens as best it can from injustice and, in the case of injustice, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P><Col N="944"/><?oasys _ic0-?>
      <P>When a health board unlawfully takes &euro;120 per week from a pensioner, it is breaching his or her property right. The State is seeking by its laws utterly to defeat that right rather than defend and vindicate that right, as it is constitutionally obliged to do. That is why the Labour Party opposes the taking of this legislation before these important constitutional issues are addressed.</P>
      <P>It is important that the constitutional aspects of this legislation should be scrutinised fully and that we should be given time to ensure everything is done to address this issue. There is agreement that the matter must be addressed and there is also universal agreement that services must be paid for. The Government has failed to deal with the issue of long-term care for the elderly. Reports are produced but nothing happens. Hopefully, progress will be made in the next year but, in the meantime, it is absolutely wrong of the Minister to sacrifice vulnerable and voiceless people to whom a wrong has been done. Nobody can support the notion that somehow by passing this legislation a pretence can be created that these charges have always been legal. All of us were reared to be honest and to tell the truth. The Minister has a reputation for being honest and telling the truth and nobody wants to take that from her but what the legislation is saying is untrue.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to collude, as parliamentarians, in something that will rewrite the past, the role of the Department and the failure of the Government to deal with this issue, although it is not solely the failure of this Government. However, the Minister is trying to offload that responsibility from her shoulders. The only way to address the issue is to give the restitution to which they are entitled to the people affected. Their money was taken from them by the State and the Government is responsible for addressing the issue.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister does the right thing but I am afraid that will not happen. A Bill is being pushed through the House, which is based on a lie, an untruth. Everybody wants to ensure care for the elderly is provided because we are not irresponsible. Such provision is difficult and costly but it faces everyone of us and we need to get our act together. I would be more than happy, on behalf of the Labour Party, to co-operate in that regard. However, I will not collude in an untruth. That is what we are being asked to do. I urge the Minister to withdraw the legislation so that we can start again and work on this issue properly.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cowley and Gormley.</P>
      <P>The Government has a duty of care to all who are in long-term care institutions. This includes a responsibility to ensure the vulnerable are always treated fairly and their rights are always upheld. The question that must be asked regarding everything that has led to this legislation is whether the <Col N="945"/>Government measures up to that responsibility and the answer is definitely &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will respond to a number of questions during her reply to the debate. We have been advised that these illegal charges were stopped in cases where people complained. How many cases were involved? Approximately 20,000 people have been subject to the illegal charges regime, despite the fact that senior health board and departmental officials knew the charges were suspect. A newspaper reported today that, in some cases, older people were refunded. However, we were advised charges were stopped in a number of cases where complaints were made. Have refunds been paid? What was the basis of the computation of the refund in each case? If precedent has been set in addressing the issue, that will have an impact in how the <i>ex gratia</i> payments should be processed.</P>
      <P>We were also told the charges were dropped last week. However, I made inquiries last evening, which indicate that people in long-term institutional care were continuing to be subject to those charges in at least one health board area. It may not be the case in all institutions but it is continuing in one area. Will the Minister clarify why this is the case, given that we were assured a communication was sent to each chief executive officer that the charges should cease forthwith? A letter issued to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the ERHA asking them to immediately stop making such charges. I ask that copies of all the relevant correspondence on this matter be made available to health spokespersons of the political parties and members of the Technical Group who are directly interested in this and allied matters. It is important that we know what communications issued and how they are being processed on the ground.</P>
      <P>An <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000 will be paid to the 20,000 people in qualifying care. What about those who have left institutions or who have died in them? Has consideration been given to payment to their estates? These people were clearly subjected to illegal charges over the period of their lifetime in care. In her address this morning, the T&aacute;naiste said each person will receive repayment of up to &euro;2,000. May we have clarification of that? The words &ldquo;up to&rdquo; suggest it may not be &euro;2,000 in every case. Is there a sliding scale of qualification and eligibility?</P>
      <P>Is it possible the former Minister, Deputy Martin, was unaware of the South Eastern Health Board&rsquo;s legal opinion that was considered over several months within his Department while he presided in office? Twelve months ago, the Department raised the matter of charges with health board chief executives and established a small group within the Department to prepare a position paper on the matter. Could that have been going on without the former Minister&rsquo;s knowledge. He stated he was unaware of the opinion obtained by the South Eastern Health Board. That is incredible. I appeal for a return to the premise that we have a duty of care and a <Col N="946"/>responsibility to ensure the rights of the most vulnerable in our society are protected. Does this legislation measure up to that responsibility? I say no. The legislation should be withdrawn and redrafted or fundamentally changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a knock-on effect of a political decision made by the Government and the Department of Health and Children to give medical cards to everybody over the age of 70 on a non-means tested basis. That decision was fine in itself, but it did not stop there. The knock-on effects continue, and this is one of them.</P>
      <P>The decision showed up the deficiencies of the Department of Health and Children and the need for reform. When the decision was initially made, a certain cost was indicated. However, the cost has mushroomed to an enormous level. Nobody knew the number of those over 70 years of age. As a result it cost the taxpayer much more money than predicted. The concession was given before it was negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation. Everybody over the age of 70 has a medical card, no matter how rich or poor. That is the difficulty which exists at this time. We are still paying for the decision.</P>
      <P>That was a concession for older people, and would have been worth doing had we been able to afford it. However, we could not afford it at the time. Minimum wage families with children were in dire need of a medical card. Instead of giving them the medical card, the scheme was extended to everybody over the age of 70. In retrospect it was a bad decision. It also drove a wedge between general practitioners in leafy Dublin suburbs and inner city practitioners as well as rural practitioners in that they were paid four times more for the same care of patients over the age of 70.</P>
      <P>Was it right to give non-means tested medical cards to everybody over the age of 70? We are revisiting that question again. A gross injustice was done to people who were made to contribute when it was illegal for the Government to do so. That now needs to be rectified. The Government is giving a sop towards this end, and the amount deducted should be refunded whatever the cost might be. Right or wrong, that is the situation.</P>
      <P>The Government messed up on this issue. I am glad it has dropped the idea of having old people apply for a refund because that would have been difficult for them. Cynical people would say it was a deliberate attempt to ensure there would be no great pay-out.</P>
      <P>This issue opens up the important debate about funding of care for older people. Greater support is needed for older people. Everybody says they should be kept in their own community if possible, but there is too much lip service. In reality many end up in profit-driven, non-community nursing homes. Where can older people go when they can no longer live in the community by themselves? Currently, they are given the choice of going to a State-run institution, if such a facility is available. There is a limited number of beds. <Col N="947"/>Political pressure ensures these institutions are located in particular areas.</P>
      <P>Community nursing units, formerly called welfare homes, form a patchy network in certain areas but not in others depending on political clout. Ballinrobe, County Mayo, still does not have a facility to care for the aged. This is an important and necessary debate. There are community alternatives. There is no reason people who are needlessly in nursing homes should not be in their own community. The potential is there for them to be kept in their own community. Some years ago, a Green Paper on psychiatric services stated the majority of long-stay residents in institutions were over the age of 65. Long-stay was defined as being resident for more than one year. The majority of these people could be brought back to their communities if facilities existed. That should be the real debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier the T&aacute;naiste paid tribute to the Opposition, saying we perform a valuable function, and that is true. Deputy Perry&rsquo;s role has been pivotal, and he has performed a valuable function as an elected Member of the House. I pay tribute to him and compliment him on his assiduous pursuit of the matter. It has come to a head in what should have been a productive manner. However, what is happening today is appalling. We are rushing legislation through.</P>
      <P>The Government should acknowledge at all times our role and function, not just at Christmas. We try to raise important issues, keep tabs on the Government, make it accountable to the public and ensure it correctly spends public money. I raised an important issue this morning. We should be involved in the framing of the terms of reference of the inquiry into the hiring of a PR consultant by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. The terms of reference should include conferences that were attended and whether they were relevant to the PR consultant&rsquo;s role. However, we were excluded from framing the terms of reference. I was regrettably blocked by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>With regard to this legislation, we are looking at how the most vulnerable people in society have been treated. The Bill is being rushed through in the same way we rushed through the legislation, comprehensive in terms of reform, on the health service in three days. We complained then, but then as now and always our complaints fell on deaf ears. This is not a listening or caring Government. This legislation confirms that.</P>
      <P>We know the Government has been illegally charging the old and vulnerable. Now it is patting them on the head, giving them &euro;2,000 if they are lucky and saying &ldquo;Happy Christmas&rdquo;. This is extremely cynical. The Government is trying to patch up the mistakes of the past but, as has been said, it is riding roughshod over the constitutional rights of our citizens, especially the elderly who have made a fantastic contribution to building up the State. They were there from the beginning, <Col N="948"/>not just through the good Celtic tiger times but through the bad times of the 1950s and beyond. Many of them had to emigrate, but we got a demographic bounce from that. However, we are looking at those in the country.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste was at pains to point out that this has nothing to do with the granting of medical cards to the over-70s. One only has to look at the Department&rsquo;s briefing document to know that was the catalyst. I have no doubt about that. The report from the Secretary General, dated 13 December 2004, points out:</P>
      <P LI="1">The capacity of health boards to raise charges from persons with full eligibility has been contested on numerous occasions over the past 30 years. Instances include the McInerney case (1976), the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Report on Nursing Home Subventions (2001), various cases pending against health boards, and the raising of the matter in the D&aacute;il over recent months. Overall, this body of law is quite complex, and has previously been regarded as allowing for some uncertainty as to interpretation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">If this body of law is so complex, why are we rushing it through with unseemly haste? The Secretary General comes to the conclusion &ldquo;It is quite clear that it now requires radical review and updating&rdquo;. We do not dispute that assessment. It may well require this, but why are we doing it in just one day?</P>
      <P>If we look at what is being said in terms of section 53(2) of the Health Act 1970, the report goes on to say that in its assessment medical card holders are exempt. It is clear that the granting of the medical card to the over-70s was extremely important. It was criticised by Professor Niamh Brennan when she came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. However, the measure, a cynical election ploy, was put through. As we all know, those are precisely the people who vote. The Government benefited from that, but now it is turning its back on those who voted it back into power. These people are being treated with total contempt and cynicism. I intend to speak again on the issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is inappropriate to use the word welcome with this Bill, but while I accept there is a problem with it, I will support it. There is a flaw in the system which has been unearthed in the past year or so. It is correct that the introduction of the free medical cards for the over-70s was the catalyst for this. However, it cannot be disputed that this problem goes back to 1976. There have been four or five different Governments since.</P>
      <P>We must consider the practical reality and Government must govern and be accountable. If we looked back all the way to 1976, we would find significant logistical difficulties in this regard. It has been estimated that this measure would cost the health boards or health authority &euro;10 <Col N="949"/>million per month. A former chairman of a health board to whom I spoke this morning said this is a conservative estimate and it could be up to double that. If that is the case we are looking at a cost of &euro;250 million. He urged me to bring this to the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>If we went right back to 1976 and tried to undo the damage or wrong, it would cause major difficulty for the Government. However, this Government did not create the problem. When I hear the Labour Party spokesperson talking about unkindness to the elderly and unfairness and lack of provision of care, I am reminded that it is not too many years since a Labour Party Minister only provided 75p of an increase to those on social welfare or suffering from disability etc. One should not therefore be critical of this Government&rsquo;s care and attention for the elderly. The most recent budget was an exceptional example of a caring Government and it gave particular help to the elderly etc.</P>
      <P>There was mention of constitutionality and rights of individuals and the elderly. It was also stated that the Bill is being rushed through. The Government, once the problem was brought to its attention &mdash; Deputy Perry and his party take credit for that &mdash; got the advice of the Attorney General who is an independent legal officer. He advised it to take a certain course of action, resulting in the current Government initiating this Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004. The Government did not introduce it to create problems coming up to Christmas. The problem was brought to its attention and the Attorney General, after some months deliberation, advised it on what to do.</P>
      <P>The Government was vilified some months ago when Members felt it was making a mistake and rushing the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill through. That Bill was passed by the Houses and tested in a referendum by the public, which gave it an overwhelming endorsement. We are criticised for rushing Bills through on one hand, but here we have an example of fast action by the Government on the advice of the Attorney General which resulted in a Bill being passed and enacted and endorsed by the public. It is important to recognise this.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I have raised the matter of medical cards for over-70s at parliamentary party meetings on several occasions. Medical cards for over-70s should be means tested. As many as 20% of elderly people are sufficiently well-off to take care of themselves, either through life assurance schemes or other sources of wealth. I accept it is difficult to assess how well-off people are. I am aware of a number of anomalies from my legal experience and work with health boards. In some cases the Department of Health and Children has been led up the garden path.</P>
      <P>Three or four years ago I came across a situation which I brought to the attention of the county manager. An elderly bachelor was in receipt of two grants, a disabled person&rsquo;s grant <Col N="950"/>and an essential repairs grant, to which he was entitled. His house was repaired but due to ill health he had to go to the local hospital where he spent up to 12 months. I assume he made some contribution to his hospital fees. When he died, he was not cold in his bed when his nephew began to look for what was due to him. This would be quite typical of such situations, although many people do not have the courage to say it. In this case, the nephew got the property. He sold the house that had been repaired at the expense of the health board through Government funds, in addition to two acres with a nice sea view, for &euro;380,000. There was also a balance of land left over. This is a common scenario where, in some instances, people with property or land are in homes in the care of the State and somebody else reaps the benefits. I was never a member of a health board but I understand health boards have powers to access bank accounts and other assets. However, I believe this power was more observed in its breach than observance.</P>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General is that this problem dates back to 1976. Some people are of the view that it may go back even further. There are implications for this and future Governments.</P>
      <P>Schull Hospital needs a 14-bed or 16-bed extension and that is on the agenda. Bantry Hospital is looking for a day care centre and it also has plans for a 50-bed convalescent home adjacent to it where land has already been bought. There are probably several other projects in the pipeline. I would prefer the Government to plough that money into the worthy cause of providing extra beds for the elderly in cottage hospitals, many of which exist in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Again being parochial, the Mizen Peninsula, in my constituency, has a population of about 5,500. I was informed at a recent meeting that 22% of the population is over the age of 65. This means there are 800 people over the age of 65 in the Mizen peninsula, which is probably one of the highest statistics for elderly people in Ireland. The 22-bed hospital in Schull is all there is to deal with the elderly in the peninsula.</P>
      <P>I do not particularly welcome the Bill. However, I will support it because the Attorney General has given clear and succinct advice to Government and it would be negligent of the Government not to act on that advice.</P>

	<P>I regret the confined nature of this debate, but I will address a number of key issues.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has said on many occasions in recent days that as soon as she got the views of the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, and Deputy Perry, she raised the issue with the Attorney General and took immediate action. I wish she were in the House to answer my ques<Col N="951"/>tion which I direct to her via the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power. Can he confirm that a meeting took place on 16 December 2003 in the Gresham Hotel, at which three Ministers were present, Deputy Martin, Deputy Callely, who had responsibility for the elderly, and Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley? Questions were raised at the meeting about the legal uncertainty of charging over-70s with medical cards. However, nothing was done. I would like to know why the then Minister, Deputy Martin, did not go to the Attorney General. Can the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, or the Minister, Deputy Harney, give any explanation for his indifference or lack of urgency? I accept the then Minister was taking his lap of honour in regard to the smoking ban but this was a core issue over which a major question mark had been raised. Why did nothing happen until Deputies Kenny and Perry raised this issue? It was only then that the T&aacute;naiste sought the opinion of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that this lack of action by the former Minister, Deputy Martin, is a serious indictment of his ministerial tenure? I suggest it is a sign of incompetence. Who will make him responsible for his lack of performance on this urgent matter affecting the most vulnerable, the elderly and sick? We have heard endless lip service from the former Minister, Deputy Martin. He constantly resorted to review groups and so on while this matter was festering in the Department. He chose to ignore the matter and he should be made accountable for this appalling oversight and for not dealing with the issue on foot of the meeting on Tuesday, 16 December 2003.</P>
      <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, confirm that meeting took place and that the issue was raised? The Department indicated it would make an assessment of the need for a stand-alone Bill in its legislative programme and that it would be necessary to get a definitive legal assessment of the current arrangement as a first step in regard to long-stay charges for the over-70s. Why did that not happen until the persistence of Deputy Perry and the Fine Gael leader led to the matter being raised as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill. I am disappointed there is not time for a more comprehensive debate. I congratulate Deputies Perry and Kenny, particularly, Deputy Perry, for his research and insistence on the matter. It is difficult to comprehend that the Department was aware of this for some time but it had to be exposed over a period of time by Deputy Perry and the leader of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>We must seriously examine our approach to the elderly, which is indicative of our attitude as a society. We have a growing elderly population. Approximately 436,000 people are aged 65 or over, which represents 11.1% of the population. Some 67.8% of these are female. It is projected <Col N="952"/>that within 30 years the number of elderly people will double to 858,000 or 18% of the population. While Ireland has the lowest percentage of older people in the European Union, the life expectancy of older people is also the lowest in Europe. It is important to note that older people are not a homogenous group. Their experiences and needs vary according to cross-cutting determinants such as socio-economic and cultural circumstances.</P>
      <P>Elderly people in hospital are repeatedly being put under stress while people try to make decisions about their future. Families are put under pressure to make decisions about elderly relatives&rsquo; continuing care by hospitals, which want to have them discharged without providing them with a care plan. Families often merely receive a message to state that a relative is being discharged. An elderly woman, who was discharged from a hospital in her dressing gown to a house on her own, walked into a river and drowned herself two days later. We must take a holistic approach to dealing with the elderly.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances to which I refer, the last person to be consulted is often the elderly person in the bed. The family, consultants and ward managers discuss the matter but often do not consult the person in the bed. It is amazing that a person who has paid taxes all his or her life and is cognitively aware, although possibly physically infirm, is not consulted about his or her circumstances. That is an affront to their dignity and independence. We must examine the issue of nursing homes and how we deal with elderly people.</P>
      <P>Elderly people who have worked all their lives do not want to put their families under pressure and stress. They do not want to be forced into the sale of assets, which may be inevitable. It is often distressing for elderly people when their families ask them to sell their houses to pay for their care because they often cling to the hope that they might return home one day. This might not happen and often it does not, but it is reasonable that they should have such hope. However, families often sit down with elderly relatives and, having worked out their level of subvention, inform them that they must sell their house to pay for their continuing treatment. If the homes of such people are taken away, they have nothing tangible from their past to cling to. There should be a policy examination of the social and psychological impact of those decisions on elderly people.</P>
      <P>We often rightly refer to the distress of families under pressure on this issue and, as politicians, we experience the difficulties and conflicts in families when they make decisions about fathers, mothers, uncles or aunts, for whom they are responsible. This in turn places extra stress on the elderly people involved. We should try to visualise the circumstances of a person who is infirm, not in control of his or her physical movement and must be confined to a hospital and subsequently realises that his or her children are fighting over him or her. We must examine the issue and ensure that stress is minimised, if not eliminated.</P><Col N="953"/>
      <P>The National Suicide Research Foundation, under the direction of Professor Ivan Perry, today published its report for 2003. The figures show an 8% increase in the incidence of attempted suicide, a 5% increase in the incidence among young women between 15 and 20 years of age and an 8% increase among young men between 20 and 25 years of age. These figures relate only to those people who attended accident and emergency departments. At least 60,000 people attempted to take their lives last year in respect of which nothing has been done, no concern has been shown and no prevention programme has been established. The T&aacute;naiste is new to her brief but I plead with her not to ignore the issues of suicide and attempted suicide in the way that has been done for decades. I am not pointing the finger at anyone in particular but rather at everyone. I implore the Minister of State and the Minister to examine the issue as a new year&rsquo;s resolution.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation and I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on introducing it. I commend Deputy Perry for highlighting on a number of occasions the shortcomings of the legislation and regulations, whereby health boards applied charges to individuals who availed of long-stay institutional care. Few individuals are not prepared to pay for the care and attention they receive in institutions throughout the State. However, this Bill will bring clarity to a practice which, as we have discovered, has not operated on a sound legal basis for almost 30 years. The charges for long-term care will now be based on a sound legal basis, which is to be welcomed. Some Opposition Members who have contributed to the debate failed to recognise that if the Government sat on its hands and was not prepared to introduce amending legislation now, the Department of Health and Children would lose approximately &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million per month. At a time when we hear cries for more resources and financial assistance for the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what is called wheeling the scrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the loss of &euro;120 million per annum to that or any Department could not be condoned.</P>
      <P>I commend and compliment the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board who highlighted this discrepancy and made the position known to the Department of Health and Children some time ago. The legal advice on the issue of charges being made in respect of medical card holders who are long-stay patients in publicly-funded residential care was requested by the South Eastern Health Board and the legal advice it received at the time was passed on to the Minister for Health and Children and the Department. The Department consulted the health board representatives on this matter and the issues raised <Col N="954"/>were considered over a period of months in the context of an overall review by the Department of the eligibility arrangements. The health board&rsquo;s position has been vindicated by the fact that this emergency legislation must be introduced.</P>
      <P>While I regret that we must sometimes introduce legislation at short notice, in this case there is no other option for the T&aacute;naiste and her Department. It is important to point out that where mistakes are made, they should be recognised. This is the case now and action is being taken to rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework for charging patients in long-term care in health board-run institutions and publicly-contracted beds in private nursing homes. It is important we acknowledge the first class care and attention elderly people receive in both publicly funded and private nursing homes. In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of private nursing homes because of increased demand due to people living longer and receiving much better care and attention, all of which puts pressure on the resources of the State and the health boards.</P>
      <P>There is long-standing acceptance that it is fair and reasonable that those who can afford to contribute to the cost of their long-stay care should do so. Moreover, the vast majority of people are prepared to do so. This scheme of making a contribution has been implemented by successive governments, not just by this one. In 1976, as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in the McInerney case, a circular was sent by the Department of Health which authorised the practice by which health board chief executives could regard patients as not meeting the criteria for full eligibility while being maintained in long-term care on the basis that necessary general practice and surgical services were being provided for them. Medical cards were then withdrawn which enabled the health boards to request payment from these patients. Most patients and their families did not have difficulty with this. From my experiences of visiting individuals in long stay care, I have never encountered a patient who resented having to make a contribution. The only case I came across, where the charge was questioned, was with an individual who was to inherit the estate of the patient. Greed is part of it but it is not on the part of the patient.</P>
      <P>The contribution made by local authorities in the form of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and essential repair grant must be recognised. Where possible, elderly individuals and couples who wish to remain in their homes in their twilight years should be facilitated to do so. These grants are available for the upgrading of houses to provide central heating, draft proofing to windows and other essential repairs. The popularity and success of these grants is evident as there is always an outcry for more funding to local authorities for their provision.</P><Col N="955"/>
      <P>One shortcoming in the application of these schemes, is the length of time taken to process the applications. The individuals applying for them are in their advanced years and it is uncaring for the application process to be strung out. I am not blaming the individual health board personnel because I know the pressure they are under. However, the Department of Health and Children, in consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, should examine a way of fast tracking these schemes.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides a generous carer&rsquo;s allowance. This scheme ensures individuals, whose families may have moved on, are looked after in their home environment. It is a scheme worthy of support. I ask the Minister to examine these schemes to ensure that individuals, particularly the elderly who have contributed to the building of this country, are looked after as far as is possible in their own homes. Only as a last resort should they avail of institutional hospitalisation. I commend the Minister for Health and Children for introducing the Bill, although it is at short notice. It is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that it is passed by the House.</P>

	<P>In normal circumstances, I would warmly welcome a debate on the challenge of ensuring that older people are adequately provided for into the future, whether this be in the home, the community, accident or emergency or hospital wards, or public and private nursing homes. However, the Bill is being rushed through the House without proper preparation and debate. With less than 24 hours notice it is difficult for Opposition spokespersons to do justice to the detail of the Bill, which will have such long-term implications. This is not the way to deal seriously with such an important issue. The T&aacute;naiste informed the House that this emergency legislation is necessary to close off a loophole that the State was aware of as early 2003. It now proposes to implement retrospective legislation. However, when issues are raised in the House, we are told they cannot be resolved retrospectively.</P>
      <P>The people in question were overcharged and are entitled to retrospective payments. If a person owes money to the Revenue Commissioners, or a lone parent is overpaid through a social welfare payment, the full rigours of the law are put in place to ensure that the money is repaid. In recent weeks, numerous cases of social welfare overpayments have been brought to my attention. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is pursuing individuals for liabilities of up to &euro;5,000. It is unacceptable that there is one law for the State and another for the ordinary people, in this case, frail elderly people. Older people are just as entitled to get what is due to them. If the Government made an error they should not be short-changed. Bundles of money are available when it is required for tribunals and the like.</P><Col N="956"/>
      <P>The demographic profile of the population is changing with increasing numbers of people living into old age. While having the youngest population in Europe, Ireland also has one of the fastest growing older populations. Our social and economic policies need to reflect this change. Most people will enjoy an active and healthy old age. However, a sizeable minority is likely to require special care as they grow old. Details of age groups from the 2002 census show that there are 436,000 people in the State over the age of 65 years and 190,398 people over the age of 75 years, more than 10% of the total population. Projections also suggest significant growth in the numbers of older people as a whole over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>This projected increase will result in a strongly demographically-induced growth in demand for health and social care services for older people. Significant services will be required to meet this demand and they will have to be funded. People in their working lives do not tend to provide for their pensions. With these changes in society, the requirements of our older people will become more evident. If services are not provided in the local community, the State will have to provide them. Surveys and reports indicate that older people want to be cared for in their homes and with minimum health service involvement. The majority want to continue to live at home. In this context, it is a scandal that community care is not adequate and is not being delivered as envisaged to deal with the legitimate requirements of older people, both now and in the future. If this issue is not addressed, there will be a knock-on effect on the care of older people. The problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The public nursing homes sector and the private sector are both important providers of long-stay care and this is an area that must be better planned. There must be emphasis on community care and long-term care for older people. I read recently in a senior citizens&rsquo; parliament document that older people must be treated in the health system in the same way babies, teenagers, adults and other groups are treated. The Labour Party fully supports that. The reality is that elderly people in need of long-term care in a public nursing home in areas of Dublin face a waiting period of up to 12.5 years.</P>
      <P>There are three subventions which are related to the assessed level of dependency. Medium dependency costs approximately &euro;114.30, high dependency &euro;153.40 and maximum dependency &euro;190.50. An enhanced subvention can be offered by the health boards up to &euro;600 per month depending on the financial circumstances of the applicant and the availability of finance within the health board region. Personal subvention rates for long-stay care, particularly in the greater Dublin area, are inadequate. They do not meet the needs of older people in nursing homes or those seeking such care. Along with this, there is no uniformity in the allocation of subventions throughout different health boards. I also recog<Col N="957"/>nise the lack of equity in the subvention scheme and the lack of transparency regarding means testing and disposal of assets in the private and public sector as demonstrated in this debate. The cost of nursing home care makes it prohibitive for the majority of people to gain access to a nursing home facility. Even with the maximum subvention, there is still a significant gap that presents a serious difficulty for most people and their families. There must be a dramatic increase in the funds allocated and changes introduced to the means test applied under the scheme pending a review of the scheme and the introduction of a proper community care service.</P>
      <P>I had reason to raise on a number of occasions in this Chamber the scandalous situation regarding the lack of access to nursing homes. As I said at the outset, I would like to have an opportunity to debate the issue of care for the elderly and how the service can be financed in future. This Bill, which is being rushed through the House, deprives older people of their entitlements, particularly at a time when a different approach is being taken to other people. This is a lost opportunity to deal adequately with the problem.</P>

It is a challenging and difficult job which is evident in the emergency legislation before the House. I also pay tribute to the outgoing Minister, Deputy Martin, who put many new procedures in place in the administrative area. He was a very innovative Minister during a difficult time in the Department.</P>
      <P>It is easy to come to lecture Ministers on the services that should be available. However, we must examine the fact that the health service costs in the region of &euro;11 billion and whether we are getting value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can identify the people if he wishes. The Department of Health and Children is the highest spending Department in the country and I empathise with the need to introduce this emergency legislation. I thank the Southern Health Board for extending the SouthDoc primary care service in the remaining rural areas of north Cork. This service employs 18 general practitioners in my area. The decision was made on Monday at a cost of &euro;1.82 million. The campaign has been in existence for a long time. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, made a promise in Mallow on Good Friday last in this regard, which has been honoured. However, it took a long time for the health board to face the reality of the necessity for this service. This will <Col N="958"/>improve the service in the area because all medical problems will first be seen by GPs in local areas.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the medical card system. We have a two-tier system, and there may be a three-tier system with the introduction of a new card. All health boards operate different systems and have different criteria. There was a more rigid approach taken in the Cork East constituency to the availability of medical cards and other services than was the case in the north Cork area of Midleton and Mallow. It was much easier to get concessions on medical cards, to which people are entitled, in the Mallow area than it was in the southern part of the constituency.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I visited a family encountering some difficulties and the woman involved told me her story. When I was leaving the house, she said that she had the medical card for those over 70 years of age and for which she was grateful. I asked her how her husband was, to which she replied that he was very well but had problems at times. I asked if she had home help and she said she did not but was paying for it. I told her that she would be entitled to home help on the medical card and that she could get home help outside the medical card. The woman said that the public health nurse told her she was not entitled to home help on the medical card for those over 70 years of age. Surely a medical card would be of less value to those under 70 years of age than for those over 70 because the second group would have more requirements. I knew that trouble was brewing in this regard. I do not understand why health boards interpret the regulation in this way.</P>
      <P>Most people have a desire to get into public nursing homes. These come under the Southern Health Board and Mid-Western Health Board areas in my constituency. Care for an elderly patient in a Southern Health Board nursing home costs approximately &euro;1,100, while the maximum charge in a private nursing home is &euro;700. While the standards in private nursing homes are very high, most people have a desire to get into public institutions because the service is better there. However, this service cannot be provided in a public nursing home at a cost of &euro;700. This issue must be addressed somehow because demand is increasing. There are more and more elderly people in need of support and help because of people being in the workplace. We must have a more liberal form of subvention if we are to address the issue of the elderly and private nursing homes because there are not enough public nursing homes available for the elderly.</P>
      <P>We could accommodate people if we had a more liberal approach to home help, with more hours available. That would be a big help because most people do not want to leave their homes but to stay in their own environment. They do not want to be institutionalised or forced into nursing homes. The home help scheme should be more liberal because a very rigid approach is being <Col N="959"/>taken to it. Different assessments could be made, with different criteria applied.</P>
      <P>In this modern world, people suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. God forbid but many of us might suffer from it when we leave this House and retire. The disease can appear at an early age. Many of those who suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are not welcome in private nursing homes because the homes have not got the facilities to care for them. Such people are more prone to going into public nursing homes. The matter is all about facilities and the kind of accommodation that can be made available.</P>
      <P>It annoys me that the means test for the subvention is very strict, especially for old people, which annoys relatives and causes friction in families. Workable criteria should be laid down so that there are fewer difficulties. There is a kind of hide and seek game played among relatives, with a daughter perhaps unwilling to support a mother or <i>vice versa. </i> This goes on quite a lot. If there were proper criteria and simplified means testing, people would find it easier to use the system and would work better with the officials.</P>
      <P>Different figures have been mentioned by Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan, with enhanced subventions. To qualify for an enhanced subvention one would want to be on the breadline. Means testing is always dreaded, but if criteria were laid down we would have a better system.</P>
      <P>The medical card was introduced in the 1960s and was very welcome at the time. I was a youngster then, and I am not the oldest Member in the House. Since the introduction of the medical card scheme there have been many changes to it, and it has been issued to many people. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report in the 1990s should have been implemented. In recent times we have had the report of the Committee of Public Accounts which is before us today. There are many reports around. The medical card is a discretionary document. After the 1976 report, a new Government came to power led by the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill if it can improve the situation. There is a long way to go in this area where so many people are seeking hospital beds, particularly long-stay beds. If we cannot alleviate that problem we will have further difficulties. We must consider a more liberal approach to means testing and increase the subventions. The entire area will be a minefield for the next 12 months because many other issues will arise from it. I do not envy the task of the Minister in trying to solve the problem.</P>

	<P>For a number of reasons, this Bill should be withdrawn. It is being rushed through <Col N="960"/>the House with no scrutiny, effectively to save money. There are other issues related to that of the elderly and nursing home care, public and private, which are not being addressed in the Bill. They include constitutional issues, the retrospective nature of the Bill, private nursing home subventions and family home and community care facilities for elderly people.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that following the payments taken illegally from elderly people, we are offering them the sop of about &euro;2,000. When the banks overcharged individuals and organisations, we in this House demanded full compensation for them. The Revenue Commissioners were short-changed by taxpayers and demanded not just repayments but interest and penalties. We are now dealing with about 20,000 vulnerable, elderly, frail people, some of them disabled or mentally ill. Rushing this Bill through the House is out of order. It should be withdrawn and the areas I have noted should be addressed.</P>
      <P>There are situations where elderly people who cannot be accommodated by health boards in public hospitals and homes are forced into private nursing homes. The question arises of the subvention for those people. I support the report issued some years ago in which the Ombudsman indicated that those people are also eligible persons under the Health Act and should be fully subvented. That matter is not addressed in the legislation. Items arising under that heading include the situation whereby very many elderly people are forced to sell the family home to fund nursing home charges. That is wrong. It puts elderly people and their families under great pressure.</P>
      <P>Community care facilities should be available for elderly people. There are not enough home help or care attendant hours available. Even though the carer&rsquo;s allowance system has been expanded over the years, the allowance remains minimal. The vast majority of carers get no payment, while those with a payment get about 70 cent per hour.</P>
      <P>I have come across a case, one of many, where two elderly people aged 90 who were forced into a private nursing home had to leave it because they could not afford it. They had to return home. That is not acceptable in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004. I share the concern of many Deputies about rushing legislation through the House without a detailed debate and sufficient time. | am open to the idea of coming to the House during the Christmas recess to allow adequate time for all Deputies to debate, analyse and examine this legislation. Rushed legislation can often be flawed. I am dismayed that we do not take a few days to deal with this important issue. I do not want to return in the future with further legislation or cause the taxpayers and citizens of this State to pay further hundreds of mil<Col N="961"/>lions of euro because the Minister and the Cabinet have got the legislation wrong.</P>
      <P>I raise these issues because legislators must give time and professionalism to all legislation. We must first acknowledge that it is the national and civic duty of everyone in this State, especially the Government, to look after our elderly. We must also acknowledge that they have played a valuable role in society as citizens and as taxpayers for many years. The Government and State have a duty and responsibility to look after them. The scheme to use the pensions has been in place since 1954 but an anomaly arose under the 2001 Act which gave the medical card to those over 70. In principle, they are entitled to free medical care but their pensions have gone automatically to the institutions. The charge is about &euro;10 million per month and the refunds could cost in the region of &euro;300 million.</P>
      <P>I urge caution on this issue. We must focus on the elderly, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients and people in their 70s and 80s to ensure that they or those directly helping them are the beneficiaries of the returned money or the income distribution.</P>
      <P>In recent days I received a letter from a constituent family of mine one of whose members is an Alzheimer&rsquo;s patient. This man is 76 years old and is suffering from age-related Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia. In early August he was assessed by the psychiatric unit for the old age team and was admitted to an institution. When members of the family visited him they had to go searching for the man and eventually found him sitting in a chair in the women&rsquo;s ward. The letter says:</P>
      <P LI="1">We then went in search of his bed and after numerous inquiries, finally found it. He was beside a window which was very draughty and we noticed how cold it felt. In relation to his hearing aid we discovered that it was not turned on, which meant he could not hear and therefore it would have been impossible for anyone to communicate effectively with him. When we explained this to one of the nursing staff we were told it was a good job that he could look after his hearing aid.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Such a comment did not inspire confidence in the family. As regards clothing etc., there were no personal items in his locker or wardrobe. They were told that his clothes had been sent to be marked with the unit brand and that they were due back on 26 October. During this visit the family noticed dirt beside the man&rsquo;s bed and described what looked like dried-up vomit which appeared to have been there for some time. These are the type of institutions in which people are being held and such issues should be dealt with as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much annoyance at the manner in which this legislation is being rushed through the House. There are concerns over the propriety of the retrospective element of the legislation. As my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has stated, &ldquo;the State has <Col N="962"/>a duty of care for those in State-provided care and institutions&rdquo;. The charging scandal, which this Bill has been brought forward to redress, has shown that the State has been remiss in its duty.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a related matter, namely, the threat hanging over the provision of respite care in County Louth. The Order of St. John of God raised concerns in 2003 regarding the level of funding available for staff at St. Mary&rsquo;s residential institute in Drumcar, County Louth. At that time it was accepted that an additional 94 staff members were required to provide a safe environment and reasonable quality of life for the people who live there. Following negotiations with the Department of Health and Children and the North Eastern Health Board, it was agreed that funding for additional staff would be made available over a three-year period. Despite the agreement, funding has been granted for only 30 extra staff to date. That is hardly a success story. This failure to fulfil the terms of the agreement is threatening to have a major impact on families who completely rely on the respite services provided by St. Mary&rsquo;s. As a result of the failure to resolve this issue, despite ongoing negotiations with the Department and the health board, the management has been forced to consider a number of options to deal with the crisis in which the institute now finds itself.</P>
      <P>One of the options under serious consideration is the closure of the respite units until funding for adequate staffing levels is made available. St. Mary&rsquo;s management does not want to close the respite services, but feels there is no choice if it is to retain an appropriate level of care for patients, given current staffing levels. Respite care gives carers a short period of relief from care work that in many cases is being provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They save the State uncalculated revenue through the services they provide. The least they deserve is to be able to access respite for those for whom they care. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to intervene, as a matter of great urgency, to ensure the people in County Louth who rely on respite services are not denied them because of delays or failure in providing funding promised to St. Mary&rsquo;s. I ask the Minister to address this crisis in his response to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004. I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward legislation so quickly. It might appear that this legislation is being rushed, but the fact is that the Government has reacted with commendable speed to a difficult situation. People in receipt of a pension who, for whatever reason, have had to go into long-term care, have a portion of their pension payments deducted by the relevant health boards. This is in line with a long-established principle of paying for bed and board, which has operated in this country for the past 50 years. It is worth noting that this has been the situation under successive Governments of all <Col N="963"/>political hues. However, it has recently emerged that the legal basis for such charges may not be sound. As the Taoiseach indicated in the House yesterday, once it was shown that there might be a legal difficulty, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children immediately ordered all the health boards to desist from charging patients who were in long-term care, while the same time she sought a definitive opinion from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>That opinion is now to hand and the Government has moved with commendable speed to put any such charges on a sound legal basis. It is important that any charges made by Government must be founded on legal security. Hence the reason for today&rsquo;s Bill. These charges relate to the cost of shelter and maintenance and amount to approximately &euro;120 per week. There is no charge for any medically related expenses incurred by such residents. The State pension is provided to people who qualify as a contribution towards their living costs of shelter and maintenance. In that regard the Government has stated that it hopes to have the old age pension raised to &euro;200 per week by the end of its lifetime. That promise was made in An Agreed Programme for Government and it will be reached. The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government delivers on its promises and this is a prime example of how the elderly may be looked after in a caring fashion.</P>
      <P>In the past it appears that various health boards followed different patterns as regards whether patients in long-term care should be charged. Indeed, even within individual health boards different approaches appear to have been followed by separate institutions. There was a high degree of confusion over how the charges were to be applied. I know of some people who were notified on admission that the deductions would come into operation after a certain length of time, while other residents were not charged for a considerable interval. This type of administrative bungling led to confusion and a degree of inequality. The Bill before the House will remove any such indecision and place any charges to be made on a sound footing. It will ensure uniformity throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the <i>ex gratia</i> payment being made to every person who has been charged in the past. Anybody who has been a long-term resident in a State institution and has had at least &euro;2,000 deducted from his or her means, will receive a &euro;2,000 refund. I welcome the fact that it will cover people currently in long-term care or who have received such care in the past. Some concern has been raised which suggests many of these people may not be able to apply for this payment. I am delighted the Taoiseach made it clear that the State will make these payments automatically. People who qualify will not have to make applications. The State will do the administration.</P><Col N="964"/>
      <P>The new Health Service Executive will be in charge of these payments and I urge it to send the money out as quickly as possible to the people who qualify. For those who may not be aware of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment, advertisements will be placed to alert the general public to the scheme. I urge the Health Service Executive to concentrate the advertising on local newspapers and local radio stations. Many elderly people listen to local radio and I hope that word about this payment will disseminate as widely and as quickly as possible. The sum of &euro;2,000 is not inconsiderable and will be warmly welcomed by the recipients. It is right and proper that the State should make this payment, as a recompense to the elderly who have had to pay for long-term care when there was not a sound legal basis for such deductions being made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>For many people the State can often appear to be distant and far removed from their daily activities. It can often appear to be cold and unfriendly. This will put a human touch to the State&rsquo;s business and it is being done out of sense of moral obligation rather than as a legal requirement. It has been mentioned that approximately 20,000 will qualify for this payment. I do not know how that figure was arrived at. It is conservative and I believe the figure to be much higher. The Department of Health and Children got it wrong when it estimated the number of people who would qualify for medical cards on reaching the age of 70. Whether the figure of 20,000 is right or wrong, the important point is that all people who have had money deducted should receive this <i>ex gratia</i> payment as soon as possible. This Bill will correct the confusion of the past and bring clarity to the issue of payment for long-term care. I congratulate the Minister on her speed in correcting this important issue and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Deputy McCormack.</P>
      <P>I want to be fair to the Minister and I compliment her for dealing with this matter when it was brought to her attention. She made a big play about the fact that the Attorney General gave her the information. In 2001, the Attorney General cleared the last Bill and he is now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He made a mess of that Bill and he has now made a mess of his Department.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On 16 December 2003, a meeting was held in the Gresham Hotel with CEOs of the health boards. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was at that meeting, as were the Ministers of State at the Department, Deputies Tim O&rsquo;Malley and Callely. They discussed at that meeting the overcharging of people over the age of 70. The then Minister knew well about it, as did the Ministers of State, so let us not pretend that this was brought to their attention in the past few weeks. They robbed the old people of this country.</P><Col N="965"/>
      <P>What about those who were over 70 who had medical cards and for whom no State bed was provided? Such people in my county were refused beds and had to go into private accommodation. They are not being looked after, so what will happen to these people? Their pension was taken away from them and their family members had to subscribe. They were hardly able to afford it, even though they had a medical card which obliged the State by law to provide for them. Many people made great play about this. I pointed out four years ago on the health committee that the Ombudsman said that the State was obliged to provide a bed for someone over the age of 70. I put that on the record four years ago when I was junior spokesperson for Health and Children, and the Minister can check that if she wants.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Devins talk about the GMS scheme. If he was owed &euro;100,000, would he accept &euro;5,000 from the State? I deal with people on social welfare who over-claim and I can tell the Deputy that the State will not take &euro;2,000 from them if they owe &euro;15,000. When the State attacked people with off-shore accounts, it penalised them and did not take a subsidised amount of money. If the State owes money to the public, it has to pay it back. We cannot have two laws; one for the State and one for the ordinary people. If the State owes money to the elderly, it must be paid back.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, knew about all this. I compliment the current Minister for dealing with the matter before the House today. However, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and members of the previous Government should not wash their hands of this issue as they knew all about it. There should be a public inquiry into this, but we should not get solicitors and barristers involved as they have made enough money from inquiries. The Committee of Public Accounts should now conduct an inquiry into this incident to find out who knew what. If the Minister, Deputy Martin, knew about it, he should resign like they do in Britain. People who were over 70 had money taken from them. The Ombudsman identified that and I identified it, as did many other Deputies in this House. What will happen to those who had a medical card, who needed and were approved a State bed, yet got nothing from the State? We have opened up a can of worms and instead of rushing legislation through the D&aacute;il, we should have closed off the loophole and had a full debate about the elderly.</P>
      <P>This is a disgrace. The State robbed the poor and it should at least pay back the money. There should be no excuses and no &euro;2,000 payments. This is not a cattle subsidy, but money the State took off old people. It should be paid back as the State has an obligation. This House is not a private institution. The State lays down the law of the land, and the law of the land states that if one takes something wrongly from another person, it must be paid back. The State must pay <Col N="966"/>the money back to the elderly and to the family members left behind.</P>

	<P>This Bill shows the hypocrisy of the Government, particularly the Minister for Health and Children. I do not compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation before the D&aacute;il. This is a cruel attempt to retrospectively legalise something that was illegal for three and a half years. It brings this House into disrepute and subjects politicians to deserved ridicule. It will certainly lead to more cynicism among the public about politicians. Rushing through this legislation on the last sitting day before Christmas should cause an outcry among the public. Health boards and the Department have confirmed that they have been illegally deducting money from old age pensioners. The Government is now making an attempt to muddy the waters. Despite such an attempt to confuse the issue by referring back to earlier Bills, it is very clear that since the Health Bill 2001 was enacted under which people over 70 qualified for medical care, health board deductions from pensioners were illegal.</P>
      <P>Health boards have illegally taken &euro;100 million from pensioners in health board nursing homes, or 80% of patients&rsquo; pensions. That amounts to &euro;80 per week per patient in 2001, &euro;104 per week in 2002, &euro;117 per week in 2003 and &euro;120 per week in 2004. That means that over the past three and a half years, health boards have illegally taken &euro;19,812 from a person on a non-contributory pension. The Minister now wants to wipe the slate clean by offering such people &euro;2,000. Who does she think she is codding?</P>
      <P>I was intrigued to hear Deputy Devins suggest that those people would welcome &euro;2,000. Would he welcome &euro;2,000 if he was owed &euro;19,800? No one would welcome that in this day and age. It is not clear if pensioners in private nursing homes with public beds also had those amounts illegally deducted from their pensions. What about the person in a private nursing home who could not get a bed in a public nursing home? Is such a person to be treated as a second class pensioner compared to others? There is no way the Minister will get away with that.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be passed today with the support of the Government parties. That is a tragedy because it is bringing this House into disrepute. What is the position on compensation for the next of kin of such pensioners who have died since July 2001? Will they be refunded? One would think that the Government was in liquidation, offering people 10 cent for every euro illegally taken from them. If this Bill is not challenged, it will attempt to make three and a half years of illegal activity retrospectively legal. We as legislators are a disgrace if we allow such legislation to pass through without protest. That is all we can do on this side of the House, because the Government has already decided that it will do that, which is highly questionable. We as legislators are a bad example to tax dodgers, cheats and others who see the Government rushing through legis<Col N="967"/>lation to help it avoid paying money legitimately owed to people. It is no wonder that people are cynical about politicians.</P>
      <P>The Minster for Health and Children is giving all politicians a bad name because the public will say that just because politicians owe money, they are able to fix it up. When members of the public owe money, nobody can fix it. A person on social welfare who is accidentally or otherwise overpaid has to pay back the money to the State. Yet the State will not pay back the money to the old age pensioners who had this money deducted from them. I was a Member of the Seanad when, on 17 December 1987, the famous rod licence Bill was rushed through the House. That, too, was rushed legislation. Rushed legislation is never correct. The then Government, after rushing that Bill through, discovered its mistake and spent the following two and a half years trying to get off the hook before abandoning the legislation. I warned the then Government that day in the Seanad and I warn this Minister now that rushed legislation is bad legislation.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister not to make the same mistake. Our citizens live 70 years to qualify for medical cover but now, in less than 70 minutes, the Minister will illegally take more than &euro;19,000 from them. Our senior citizens deserve better and this D&aacute;il should not be used to rush through legislation that makes a farce of Members as public representatives and leads to cynicism about politicians and what they do. This Minister for Health and Children is adding to that cynicism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>As a long-standing Member of the House, party Whip of the Progressive Democrats and former Opposition spokesperson on health, I regret that we must rush through this legislation on the last day of the session. Patently, it will receive inadequate scrutiny. However, I accept the advice of the Attorney General and the political judgment of the T&aacute;naiste and the Government that these are extenuating circumstances and that to protect the Exchequer from the loss of an income stream which has been accepted for the past 50 years by all parties in the House, it is appropriate to move quickly to regularise the situation with these charges.</P>
      <P>The legal advice is that the current system of charging for long-term care is without legal basis, notwithstanding that such charges have been made in good faith under the relevant regulations for 50 years. This legislation seeks to regularise the matter and to protect the Exchequer against liability for the total cost minus the charges, which is deemed to be approximately &euro;10 million per month. That income stream amounts to approximately &euro;100 million per annum. It is important, in the context of the overall review of <Col N="968"/>the health services system, that every Member of the House supports endeavours to get maximum value for taxpayers&rsquo; money which will amount to &euro;11 billion in the Estimates for next year&rsquo;s health budget.</P>
      <P>The question is whether the T&aacute;naiste is doing the right thing. Obviously, the Opposition queries that. I believe she is. The political call the T&aacute;naiste has made on this issue is that she has a constitutional duty to protect the taxpayer against this patent loss of income as a result of a malfunction or maladministration. I welcome that the T&aacute;naiste took immediate action when this matter was brought to her attention.</P>
      <P>This saga raises questions about who knew what and when. For that reason, the T&aacute;naiste, in characteristic form, decided to put an inquiry in place. It will be headed by an eminent individual who will go through the various aspects of this matter and test how robust the administration was in dealing with it. It is clear that the matter was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Children in March 2003 and that it was discussed at departmental level. The minutes of that meeting, which was attended by three Ministers, senior officials and chief executive officers of the health boards, were circulated. It is clear the matter was raised and an instruction was given that legal advice be sought. For some reason, following receipt of the legal advice, a letter was drafted by the Department but not sent.</P>
      <P>There are issues of legitimate concern. The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that she is not seeking to blame but to avoid a situation whereby such a malfunction, maladministration or mistake can recur. I was involved in 25 debates in this House about the hepatitis C scandal. In that situation, legitimate questions were raised by Opposition Deputies over a period of two years. They tried to extract the truth about what turned out to be a total disaster in terms of the effectiveness of the then Department of Health and the blood transfusion service to protect vulnerable women and to protect the taxpayer against huge liability due to negligence.</P>
      <P>Credit is due to the Opposition for tabling the appropriate questions to the Minister on this issue. It succeeded in extracting the truth in so far as we know it. I applaud the Deputies who tabled questions in that regard. It is essential in a Department so large and costly as the Department of Health and Children that there be a system of proper accountability for its massive, multi-billion euro expenditure. This is one such case. I regret that the Government is forced to introduce this legislation in such a hasty manner but it has a constitutional obligation to move speedily when it is apparent, and legal advice from the Attorney General indicates, that the State must protect the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It is disingenuous of the Opposition to suggest that no charges be levied for persons in full-time care&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when Deputies from all parties have accepted these charges over the years. If people examine the substance of this issue, they will see that the Government is trying to do the right thing. The issue of charging for people in full-time care, particularly the elderly, will have to be dealt with on a more long-term basis given the demographics. Every Deputy knows that.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House. The Opposition should understand the situation in which the Government finds itself. I look forward to the results of the inquiry that has been established by the T&aacute;naiste. It will be to the benefit of the Department that when mistakes are made, people take responsibility for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD"><NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I take serious issue with the emotive, over the top and exaggerated language used by some Opposition Members, particularly Deputy McManus. Talk of mugging the elderly is outlandish and calls for an apology and full restitution are grossly unfair. If Deputy McManus had listened to the Minister for Health and Children, she would have heard her say that where mistakes are made it is important that they be acknowledged, that responsibility be taken for them and, if possible, that they be redressed. As is her trademark, the T&aacute;naiste is doing that and ensuring that lessons are learned and applied.</P>
      <P>I particularly take issue with the attempt to draw a comparison with AIB&rsquo;s recent episodes of overcharging customers or the penalties imposed by the Revenue Commissioners on individuals for deliberate attempts at tax evasion. The charges on people in long-term residential care were not being levied for base profit considerations or to fill the State&rsquo;s coffers. They were being used to support the provision of quality services for those in long-term care. The situation in the AIB or any other institution is utterly different. Attempts to draw such comparisons amount to cheap, political points scoring. The money raised by these charges was used to provide essential, long-term care services for those from whom they were raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus has been her party&rsquo;s spokesperson on health for a considerable time. She is aware of and understands the cost involved and the resources required for the provision of high quality appropriate long-term care. It is highly disingenuous of her to suggest there was something morally wrong in what the Government was doing. These charges were illegal; they were not immoral. That is an extremely important distinction.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice of successive Governments since 1954 &mdash; Governments in which colleagues of Deputy McManus served &mdash; to levy appropriate and necessary charges for those in long-term care. Is Deputy McManus now suggesting that if her party were in power, no charges <Col N="970"/>would be levied on anybody in public nursing homes? I had a cursory look at the Labour Party manifesto but have seen no such commitment in its pages. In fact, the manifesto makes very little reference to care of the elderly. I recall that it was the T&aacute;naiste at our party conference in April who made a political commitment to the elderly by pledging to their care Exchequer funding currently used for SSIA schemes. Nobody recognises more than she the contribution of this group to the country over the past 50 years or is as anxious to ensure they are cared for and cherished in their later years. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s record stands on its merits.</P>
      <P>While Deputy McManus paid tribute rightly to Deputy Perry of Fine Gael for raising the issue of the legality of charges, I detected a certain regret that she missed the opportunity to do so herself. I wonder if that is the cause of today&rsquo;s naked opportunism. Deputy Cowley wants all deducted moneys to be refunded. While we would all love that, Deputy Cowley knows full well that he and other Members will be back in the House seeking extra funding for various health services nationally.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s legislation will bring clarity to a regime that has not operated on a sound basis for nearly 30 years. It represents a genuine attempt to correct flaws in the system. It is imperative, therefore, that the Bill is passed today. I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Crawford and Hayes.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know whether any additional words can be summoned by Opposition Members to express our outrage at the emergency legislation before us. The analogy has been made whereby it is suggested the T&aacute;naiste runs the risk of being considered in future political history in the same way as Ernest Blythe who took a penny off the pension. The effect of her legislation is an attack on the most vulnerable citizens who find themselves in need of care, who had been in receipt of State money and then that money was taken from them. They are now being given half a horse to repay the damage done by the Government.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I find it incredible that information was made available to departmental officials but not, according to Deputy Martin, to the Minister. We must accept that information was available and made known but resulted in political inaction. A particularly offensive aspect of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response in providing for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000 is that it will not only fail to meet the costs of the people who were overcharged, but will send a series of mixed messages on the care of the elderly. Where do those who choose to care for aged relatives in family settings stand in terms of Government policy? <Col N="971"/>Will they be promised an <i>ex gratia</i> payment on foot of the money they save the State? The recent budget was particularly deficient in the provision of additional resources for carers. Will the voluntary agencies which visit and provide resources to those who cannot receive full-time nursing home or family care and consequently live alone receive an <i>ex gratia</i> payment based on the number of people with whom they work?</P>
      <P>The lack of joined up thinking in this context is as typical of the Government as the reactive approach to legislation we have seen far too regularly in the 29th D&aacute;il. We are beginning to lose count of the number of Bills that have been introduced on an emergency basis. Emergency Acts always come back to the House at a later date to receive the more extensive consideration required to formulate better legislation. Unfortunately, the Government has chosen to travel down the wrong road again. Rather than to own up properly to its mistakes, the Government has chosen to create a new set of victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important legislation. I am vexed that it should be introduced at the last minute in the session. It is another example of rushed legislation, which has always proved in the past to have had negative consequences. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Perry, for bringing this matter to the attention of the public. He has done a wonderful service to the elderly and the system of care provided for them. While I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste has come out with her hands up, her offer falls far short of what is required.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the T&aacute;naiste can introduce retrospective legislation when it is required to save the Government money. It should be remembered that when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it was decided it would be illegal to legislate to apply increases in redundancy payments retrospectively when I wanted her to backdate them for workers at Lissadell Towels. The Taoiseach himself said it would be illegal to make the Bill before us retrospective. Who are we to believe? What is the legal position? I remember a previous scenario in which animal health grants were made retrospective to January and subsequently to an earlier date to suit the individuals concerned in legislation introduced in May. If money could be provided to deal with an animal health issue, it is strange that we are so anxious to prevent the payment of money to care for the over-70s. They are people and they built the State.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the problem was known to the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, and Minister of State, Deputy Callely. It is stated in the documentation supplied by the T&aacute;naiste that a meeting attended by Deputies Martin, Callely and Tim O&rsquo;Malley took place this day 12 months ago at this exact hour at which the subject of long-stay <Col N="972"/>charges for persons over 70 years of age was discussed. Why, despite written evidence from a senior health board representative that the matter was signposted in July 2001, must the Bill be introduced suddenly a few hours before the House breaks for Christmas 2004?</P>
      <P>There are many things I would like to discuss in this context. I cite the example of a farmer who lives in his own home, but as it is in his mother&rsquo;s name, its value is taken into account in an assessment for subvention. Will the legislation before us provide that family with a chance to obtain a subvention? Cavan-Monaghan is a Border area that is supposed to be well looked after due to the peace initiative. At the last election, we had 254 people in receipt of subvention but there are only 214 now. People must register on a waiting list to receive one. The House must reconsider the issue as soon as possible when sitting resumes after Christmas to ensure we make proper provisions for care of the elderly. The Minister of State opposite should note that this is not a laughing matter but is extremely serious. The people involved built the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill. We must commend Deputy Perry on his insistence in seeing this issue through. It is a demonstration of the importance of the job of backbenchers that Deputy Perry was so successful in his efforts. His achievement must be recorded.</P>
      <P>While it is positive to see the issue involved addressed, it is a pity in some ways that we must have this debate. Once again, older people have been treated unfairly.</P>
      <P>The truth is that elderly people are very vulnerable. They depend on the State in their later years and need security. This legislation has highlighted the insecurity this problem has caused many elderly people and the need for legislation. When the Bill is passed the Minister should ensure that people are informed of their entitlements, either by way of an advertisement campaign or through direct contact. I was on a local radio programme this morning and listeners were telephoning in inquiring about entitlements. There is total confusion surrounding the issue and the Minister should clear it up and ensure everyone is aware of his or her entitlements.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not the best country in the world in which to grow old because of our attitude, this problem that has now arisen and the general insecurity. That affects not only older people but the many families who have to look after elderly parents or other relatives. We have forgotten about the elderly for too long. They have made a major contribution to society. Proposals must be brought forward to ensure the elderly are looked after properly. All the figures confirm that the country is getting better off by the year and in that respect we should examine the way we look after our elderly.</P>

	<P>Who is introducing the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt Deputy Boyle so he might just allow me my few minutes to speak, although I know the Ceann Comhairle will protect me. Other colleagues talked about nursing homes in every parish in their constituencies and I am sure they will not object if I mention Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Power, well in his job. I agree with one statement made earlier by the Opposition. There is a need for a comprehensive debate on the care of the elderly. I represent a constituency with a young population. There is not a large elderly population in Tallaght, although we have some elderly residents. There are challenges in that regard and in my constituency of Dublin South West, particularly in the Tallaght area, we have long had a difficulty with regard to accommodation for the elderly. I made the point in various debates, particularly in debates on Private Members&rsquo; business, that many families come to see me regarding subvention, property issues, which was the subject of some debate earlier, and the problem of finding accommodation. Like many other families in the Dublin region they have to go elsewhere to find accommodation because it is not available in many of those communities.</P>
      <P>Despite being the third largest population centre in the country, Tallaght has suffered in that regard. There are a number of private nursing homes in Tallaght, and there is the Crooksling Hospital in Brittas. I am pleased to refer to the recent development of the Kiltipper Woods care centre, which is a new care centre catering for the elderly and for young, chronically ill people. That centre, which is only a mile from Tallaght <Col N="974"/>Hospital, provides a tremendous service to the local community.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with some of the comments of my colleagues opposite but we should be fair to the T&aacute;naiste who has reacted to a particular problem. She was right to bring in legislation to address it. I am bemused when I hear Members complain about legislation. One day they are calling for more legislation and the next they are saying too much legislation is rushed through the Houses. As a new Member, I sometimes get confused about the situation here and it has taken me some time to realise that many Members are simply scoring political points. As we are so close to Christmas, although not as close as Deputy Crawford appears to think &mdash; it is longer than a few hours away&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>We will gladly sit next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The public can see through that cynicism. They know we are trying to deal with all the business. That is what we are doing here today and on which we will vote later in the afternoon. There is other legislation we could have dealt with today but the Government would be in dereliction of its duty if it did not respond to a problem that was brought to its attention. Like other colleagues, I am not afraid to compliment Deputy Perry and his colleagues in that regard. They are in opposition and that is what the Opposition does in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister and other colleagues have put on record the view that the legal advice on the issue of the charges being made in respect of medical card holders who are long-stay patients in publicly funded residential care was requested in the first instance by the South Eastern Health Board. The advice it received was then passed on to the Department in March 2003. The Department consulted on the matter with health board representatives and we were told on a number of occasions &mdash;I do not understand why it is not believed &mdash; that the issues raised were considered over a period of months in the context of an overall review of eligibility arrangements under way in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The legal position on long-stay charges in health board institutions is based on a succession of provisions in the Health Acts, various sets of regulations made under those Acts and interpretation of those provisions arising from judgments on cases in the courts. The capacity of health boards to raise charges from persons with full eligibility has been contested on a number of occasions over the past 30 years, and those matters have been placed on the record.</P>
      <P>The overall position about charges in public institutions was discussed at the end of year review meeting held with chief executive officers of the health boards on 16 December 2003. The record shows that as a result of that discussion a small group was convened in the Department to prepare a position paper on the legal issues sur<Col N="975"/>rounding charges for long-stay patients in public institutions as a prelude to submitting a request for legal advice to the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The Minister impressed me when she said the work of the Department during 2004 was dominated by a number of issues including the unprecedented requirements of the health reform programme which have demanded a large commitment of time, particularly at senior level, in the Department and on the part of successive Ministers; the requirements of an active Presidency of the EU in regard to health issues; the management of ongoing service pressures in areas like accident and emergency, disability services and services for older people and the management of ongoing financial pressures. I am glad some colleagues acknowledged that, in those circumstances, the follow through on the position paper prepared in the Department did not receive the priority that would otherwise have been possible. In the event, the request for legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General was made, as the Minister said, on 27 October 2004.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General gave initial legal advice to the T&aacute;naiste by letter of 5 November 2004. In light of that advice, work was immediately commenced on preparation of a short Bill to amend the Health Act 1970. That culminated in preparation of the draft Bill submitted to Government on 14 December 2004. I am told a further advice was received from the Attorney General in December 2004. On foot of this, a letter was issued to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking them immediately to stop making those charges, pending the introduction of amending legislation. I am told the health boards confirmed on 10 December that they had taken the necessary steps to do so.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and I sympathise with many of the points made. It is the job of the Opposition to oppose and the job of the Government to govern. The Minister for Health and Children has been applauded, not only from the PD benches but also by other speakers, for the manner in which she is dealing with this matter. Sometimes one is damned if one does and damned if one does not.</P>
      <P>The legislation will be welcomed. Some of my colleagues have drawn flak in response to their stated opinions regarding payments. That may be fair enough. However, the Minister is right to deal with the question of payments and I hope the matter will be dealt with as efficiently as possible and the cheques paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike other speakers, I wish to make a few points relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I was following the example of Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will amend section 53 of the Health Act 1970 by substituting, &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in the Health Acts 1947 to 2004 but subject to subsections (3), (4) and (9), the Minister shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;, which is the wording of the Health Act 1970. If this Bill amends the Health Acts 1947 to 1970, where stands the Health Act 2004?</P>
      <P>Because the Bill proposes to impose a retrospective liability, contrary to the constitutional rights of people thereby affected, the Labour Party does not support it. The Bill substitutes the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the 1970 Act. The health authority did not act on the Supreme Court judgment of 1976 and no legislation was passed to deal with the matter. We were told that because of major pressures, such as the health reform programme and the EU Presidency, time could not be found to deal with this matter. Consequently, the elderly were forgotten and continue to be forgotten.</P>
      <P>The Bill prevents people from seeking rebates if they did not claim before 14 December 2004. Certain parties can claim because they had been advised to do so by their legal advisers and have lodged claims. They will be fully compensated because they were fortunate enough to go to their legal advisers and make applications. Others will be prevented from doing so.</P>
      <P>The measure applies to community hospitals and where the health boards have contract beds in private hospitals. No reference is made to the fact that families of elderly people are directed to private nursing homes. Health board officials are providing them with application forms and telling them that places are not available in public facilities. These families have no choice but to accept places in private nursing homes. They then find they are liable for the full cost, except for a subvention of &euro;190 per week, which is what most of them are entitled to. Medical card holders are entitled to the full cost of private care. Surely it should be taken into consideration that many people are being directed to private nursing homes. It is not their choice. They go to private nursing homes because health boards do not have adequate provision for them in public hospitals.</P>
      <P>In some instances, family homes are sold to meet the cost of private nursing home care. Old people lying in hospitals know their family homes are being sold. Legislation requires that it be done in order to pay for private nursing home care. Such people have full eligibility under the Health Act 1970 but they are not receiving the service for which they are eligible. In introducing this legislation the Government seeks to renege <Col N="977"/>on future payments for medical card patients. Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, health boards pay a subvention to assist a person in meeting the cost of nursing home care. I call on the Government to review this system. The Minister says she has asked Mr. John Travers, a retired head of Forf&aacute;s to examine the Department&rsquo;s management of this issue and the reason the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was not sought at the earliest possible time.</P>
      <P>Given this situation, what can we expect when power is handed over to the Health Service Executive and full control is given to 11 people? What is happening is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for sharing time.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the extent of the information given to the House by the Minister this morning. She outlined very clearly the position pertaining to this issue and the sequence of events surrounding it. I thank her for that clarity and openness.</P>
      <P>However, the manner in which the issue has been handled since it first came to light in 2002 throws up many questions which need to be answered fully. We must ensure that there is accountability. When issues arise which affect the vulnerable they must be dealt with urgently and fully.</P>
      <P>Another disquieting aspect of the case is that people who complained were not charged while others who did not complain were charged, even though they were in the same health board area. That is despicable. It resurrects a comment made by the Minister for Finance on budget day that people with disabilities were treated poorly in the past because they had a weak voice. Unfortunately, that is true but it illustrates a reprehensible trait in Irish society. The strong prosper at the expense of the weak. Government must guard against this trait. We must always protect the weak.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence of any attempt to protect the weak in the handling of this matter. The initial approach taken to the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000, that elderly people in nursing homes would have to make a written application, is proof of that. The strong may be able to do this but the weak would not. This is not how a caring, sharing Government should operate and it bestows no credit on the Government that it only backed off from this proposal in the face of opposition.</P>
      <P>This came to the attention of the Department in 2002. At the very least, all money taken from patients since that time should be refunded, together with the <i>ex gratia</i> payment. We cannot have one law for the Government and a different law for the citizen. For example, if a social welfare recipient unknowingly receives an overpayment from the State, he or she will be pursued by the State for repayment of that amount, even where he or she is unaware of the overpayment and the fault lies with the Department of Social <Col N="978"/>and Family Affairs. The Government is obliged to repay the money knowingly and illegally taken from those vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why yet another report must be compiled by the Department on this issue. Is the Department not expending money that could be used elsewhere in the health service? There has been a total cock-up in the handling of this issue since 2002. It has been allowed to continue for a number of years without being acted on because it was judged that other matters were more important. The Minister does not need a report. The circumstances are clear and she can and should take action to ensure there is not a repeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I refer to the charge that the Government is rushing the legislation through the House. It would be a highly irresponsible Government that would not rush it. If it was left until after the Christmas recess, a bill of &euro;30 million would be amassed, and such an amount would be better spent in other areas. It would be reprehensible if the Government did not take its duty seriously and seek to remedy the issue as soon as possible. The charges about rushing the legislation are extremely disingenuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>What about 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Good Government is about priorities and making sound judgments. State spending is finite and a decision to levy a charge on people in long-term care who have the means to pay is the principle underpinning the legislation. The question of how much it costs if it is free does not have to be addressed by Opposition Members. The Government must constantly think of this wise oxymoron. It is easy for Opposition Members to say that if they were in a position of power and influence to make this decision, they would let the public finances run riot and refund every person who has made such payments since 1976. That would be highly irresponsible and no party in Government would consider that option. It is a cheap shot and politicking on the part of Opposition Members to throw these accusations at the Government. The language used has been anything but temperate. It is a pity because it does politics no good to throw an issue such as this around like a football.</P>
      <P>References or attempts to make comparisons with recent overcharging scandals in the AIB and other institutions are also highly unfair. The Minister pointed out yesterday that in these cases the bottom line in for-profit organisations was involved whereas, in this case, State resources are involved. It is in our interest that they are managed correctly and in the most efficient manner possible. The resources generated in the State should be devoted to those who are not in a position to pay and they should be provided in the <Col N="979"/>most appropriate way possible. That is why choices must be made.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s gesture is generous. The &euro;2,000 payment is a sign of goodwill. Many people may feel it is not enough but it is a measure of goodwill and an acknowledgement of the imposition of an illegal charge. If limitless amounts were refunded, one would have to ask what health services would be cut back to provide the money. It is a wise gesture on the part of the Government for this reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister pointed out in her opening contribution, the legislation is necessary to provide a legal framework for the long-established practice of charging those patients in long-term care in health board run institutions and publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes. The Office of the Attorney General has provided advice on the current system of charging for long-term care and has concluded that health boards have no legal entitlement to charge persons who are fully eligible, including those who are 70 and over.</P>
      <P>Given this advice, my Department wrote to each of the health boards instructing them to stop imposing charges on fully eligible persons in receipt of health services, pending the enactment of legislation to regularise the power to impose <Col N="980"/>such charges. If this loophole is not closed to allow this funding to be retained, a significant loss of resources for the health services will result. As the difficulty may date back to 1976, the need to bring in the legislation becomes even clearer, given the potential liability for the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated a number of people who complained had their charges stopped and that refunds had been provided in some cases. He asked what is the basis for the refunds. We do not have details in this regard but we will contact the health boards and ask them to investigate these issues. We will provide information to the Deputy when they report back.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>It is generally accepted these charges, as contributions to the cost of care, are fair and reasonable. In addition, if more money is refunded, less money will be available for services. It would be irresponsible not to endeavour to continue to collect these charges in these circumstances. The charges in the legislation are intended to cover maintenance of patients in publicly provided long stay care.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>I am aware of concerns about the provisions of the Bill that declare that the imposition of charges prior to the enactment of the legislation is and always has been lawful. However, my Department is satisfied, in the light of legal advice available to it, that it is constitutional and in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Department has received advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which includes advice from external counsel, including Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, a leading expert in constitutional law and co-author of <i>Kelly on the Constitution</i>.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The Bill seeks to protect the State from having to refund moneys that could date back to 1976 in regard to charging practices, which were accepted under successive Governments. The refunds issue could have a significant impact on the finances of the State and its ability to provide public services across the board as well as health services. This key aspect of the legislation is vital to preserve the resources available to the Exchequer and it is in the interests of the taxpayers. The subsection as drafted, therefore, is the best way to protect the resources of the State contributed by the taxpayers and the only financially responsible way to proceed.</P>
      <P>The Minister earlier made it clear that one of her immediate objectives was to place on record all the facts that she knew. Deputy McManus asked for copies of all relevant legal advice. It is a long-standing policy of Departments not to release legal advice as it would be prejudicial to the State&rsquo;s ability to defend litigation in the courts.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputies referred to comments in the report of the Secretary General regarding the complexity of the legislation and the need for overall review. The comments refer to the overall body of law surrounding eligibility, and the policy and legal complexity involved helps explain the time it has taken to conduct the overall review that has yet to be completed.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed with regard to the language in this Bill. There is no additional cost associated with the two amendments I put down. I suggest that within three months of the passing of the Act, the Minister for Health and Children should lay a report before the D&aacute;il with regard to <Col N="984"/>a database of patients. I am astonished that the T&aacute;naiste would not incorporate that. It should not be outside the scope of the Bill. The provision for the contract with the next of kin should also be included. Can she give a commitment that these two critical amendments will be accepted? In State health institutions there is no database of any patient account and next of kin is not identified. There is mayhem in the system.</P>
      <P>The language of the Bill is intemperate. In section 1 it would be easy to insert the words &ldquo;shall not be&rdquo; with regard to the charge. It would mean no ambiguity. However, as we speak , there is no database of patient accounts. There should be an account in every patient&rsquo;s name where debits and credits could be clearly identified as well as the reason for deductions.</P>

This is critically important. Equally important &mdash; I am speaking when I get the opportunity &mdash; is a patient database and my amendment on the next of kin.</P>

	<P>This amendment has been tabled to try to put a short life on this Bill. There is much unease and concern about how this Bill is being processed through the House without proper scrutiny. That is probably what prompted this amendment.</P>
      <P>While I have the opportunity, I object strenuously to the fact that amendment No. 1 has been ruled out of order on the basis it would likely result in a charge to the State. However, if this amendment is not adopted, I suspect there will be a much bigger charge to the State because many lawyers will get fat as a result of this Bill and many hours will be spent in the courts challenging aspects of it.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to another issue and Deputy Se&aacute;n Power has raised a new one. We have received the minutes of a significant meeting where this issue was debated and discussed by all the key players in the health service, Ministers, Department officials and CEOs. They were all there in one room. The senior Minister may have been out of the room at the time but the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, was there. This is new and crucial information because it clearly signifies that the matter was discussed and that the Department and the Minister had knowledge at that time. I am happy to accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, is giving us a message. I have no quibble with him.</P>

	<P>They are entitled to have an opportunity to speak on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I think is of concern to the Ceann Comhairle as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is concerned that we stay within Standing Orders.</P>

	<P>Under Standing Orders we are debating amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who was previously Minister for Health and Children should make a full statement to the House. We do not want messengers coming here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It does arise and it is important that it is dealt with. To protect the interests of this House and its Members, will the Ceann Comhairle ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has no role in getting involved in a political debate. He has to stay out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Minister, Deputy Martin, who is clearly central to the issue, is asked to make a full statement to the House so we can get to the bottom of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is taking up the time of other Members who wish to speak on the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, which can be regarded as a sunset clause. We want this hastily conceived legislation to cease next year. This makes sense as the way in which it has been rushed through is very bad for the reputation of the House and makes for bad legislation. We are simply trying to patch up mistakes that have been made in the past.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children was not here for my contribution on Second Stage. It appears that, despite her earlier denials, <Col N="986"/>the introduction of medical cards for over-70s was certainly a catalyst for this debacle. She may well claim that it dates back to 1976. Professor Niamh Brennan who came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, in addition to economists whom the T&aacute;naiste would admire greatly, including Se&aacute;n Barrett, said this was an ill-conceived step, that it would be ill-advised to go ahead with it and that it really amounted to a vote-catching exercise.</P>
      <P>We should examine the legislation in greater detail. Repercussions will arise from the legislation, which I hope will not be as bad as I think it could be. The Minister is riding roughshod over the old and vulnerable. They are being given a pat on the head and &euro;2,000. The Minister is wishing them a happy Christmas and telling them to be on their way, which is no way to do things.</P>
      <P>More than that, the legislation is conceiving a new way of dealing with long-stay patients. It is not just dealing with the past, it is setting up a new way of dealing with the matter in future. I find this approach reprehensible, but it is in keeping with the right wing philosophy of this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration. It is saying to the elderly that they have served the country but now they must pay for the treatment they deserve and have earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay the House too much in the short time we have. The Fine Gael Party has tabled a total of 12 of the 14 amendments that have to be taken in 15 minutes. In response to the intervention of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, who said the Minister left a meeting and there was no Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already ruled Deputy McManus out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not have time to speak again on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that but the Chair is obliged to insist the Deputy speaks on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was said that the Minister left the meeting and he was unaware of what was on the agenda. He left the meeting, came back to it and did not get the minutes of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise. I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>In pleading ignorance of what happened, he is trying to fool us further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. That does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not believe it. It is a matter of ministerial incompetence that the Minister sat on a major issue for almost 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="987"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not labour the point, in fairness to Deputies who wish to speak on this amendment. We are debating amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Twomey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point. It reminds me of the former Minister, now Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, telling us that she was in the bath when something else happened. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was possibly washing his hands or was in the toilet when this matter was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are long past Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>We all hear a great many fairy tales at Christmas time but this is one we do not believe. This was gross incompetence and the Minister, Deputy Martin, should make a statement to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Allen should allow Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, which has been described as a sunset clause. The purpose of the amendment is that the Act would cease to have effect as of 1 March 2005. There would be some merit in considering the amendment as it would allow an opportunity to properly explore and review all the elements that are swirling around the core issue at the heart of the Bill. Without question, there are serious matters to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the legislation as presented is not a definitive response. It is flawed in many respects. The Minister did not respond to questions posed in the course of Second Stage. By adopting amendment No. 2, the Minister would afford not only an opportunity to herself but to the Department and the health boards, which without question will face a vista of legal challenge. Adopting the amendment would allow for time to properly <Col N="988"/>explore and prepare alternative legislation to deal with the matter in a substantive and caring way.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, we have a responsibility, and the Government in particular has a responsibility, to ensure that the vulnerable are always treated fairly and always have their rights upheld. The legislation seeks to take away a fundamental right of legal recourse where illegal charges have been applied to a significant number of citizens heretofore, some of whom will pass on in the near future.</P>
      <P>We posed several questions in the course of Second Stage to which there has been no response. We have not been given the necessary clarification to inform a broad debate on this matter. I urge the Minister to accept that this proposition is fundamentally flawed. Amendment No. 2 offers a way to overcome the immediate difficulty and places responsibility on the Minister and her Department to come back with all the information and properly drafted legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. The Minister has the numbers to push the legislation through but she must accept it is rushed and there should be a mechanism to completely review the situation. I do not wish to repeat what I said on Second Stage about my concerns in regard to the area of treatment of the elderly which could be evaluated, examined and legislated for in the context of what is happening here. The amendment would allow for comprehensive legislation to be drawn up following a proper debate.</P>
      <P>It is strange that the Minister did not read the minutes of that meeting 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As it is now 3.30 p.m., in accordance with the Order of the House today, I must put the following question: &ldquo;That in respect of each of the sections undisposed of, the section is hereby agreed to in Committee, the Title is hereby agreed to in Committee, the Bill is, accordingly, reported to the House without amendment, that Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed.&rdquo;</P>

        <Quest>when the Competition Authority will publish its studies on the professions; the likely timetable for implementation of the authority&rsquo;s recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33881/04]</QRef><Col N="990"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Competition Authority published its final report on competition in the engineering profession on 1 December 2004 and concluded that the regulatory regime in that profession facilitates competition. The authority previously published a consultation document on the architecture profession and I expect to receive that report by March 2005. The studies of other professions, across the medical, legal and construction sectors are ongoing and those reports will be released during 2005. A consultation paper and initial recommendations on the veterinary surgeon profession will be published in the first quarter of 2005 and the final report in the second half of the year. The authority&rsquo;s initial recommendations and consultation paper in respect of the two legal professions, solicitors and barristers will be published in January 2005 and the final report will be published later in the new year. Initial recommendations and consultation papers in respect of each of the three remaining medical professions will be published during the <Col N="991"/>second half of 2005. On receipt of the final reports, I will examine the recommendations and take any appropriate action as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that a two and a half year gestation period for the Competition Authority to draw up initial consultation papers and final reports on the professions is considerable? The issue regarding competitiveness was brought to the attention of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste as a serious problem facing the economy as far back as 2001. Will the Minister accept that no action has been taken by the Government in tackling lack of competitiveness in certain areas? Today, the Central Statistics Office published a report indicating prices for many goods and services are higher in Dublin than the rest of the country. What timescale does the Minister envisage to ensure the Competition Authority is given the resources, back-up, leadership and direction that it badly needs to ensure action will be taken on the liberalisation of the professions as early as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Competition Authority has held extensive consultations in compiling these reports. Significant research was also carried out by Indecon and published on 20 March 2003, which was an important part of the process. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s work on mergers has stretched its capacity and, at various times, has created pressures in it achieving its workload. Sanction for six additional posts, specifically dealing with mergers, was recently given to the authority. The Competition Authority recently completed its study on the banking sector, published this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be worried if the banking sector welcomed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Competitiveness is not just about prices but goes across a range of issues in the economy, such as research and development, skills and availability of labour force. With the establishment of the anti-inflation group by the Government several years ago, a significant focus has been brought to inflation and bringing it under control. We must be vigilant with the pricing and competition issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister happy with the Competition Authority&rsquo;s performances in so far as it has only brought four cases to court? Is this an indication of the authority&rsquo;s will to tackle vested interests in the economy in liberalising the market? Will the Minister comment on the statement by the chairman of the authority that bank charges should be left to the banks and market and that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, established to deal with these matters, should have nothing to do with the adjudication <Col N="992"/>and notification of charges from financial institutions?</P>

	<P>I met recently with the chairperson of the Competition Authority. He has been a particularly energetic force in driving forward the competition agenda. The report on engineers was published on 1 December 2004 and it found that the current regulatory regime in the engineering profession facilitates competition. He went on to make a number of recommendations. However, there are more difficult issues in the pipeline. I am satisfied with the role and performance of the Competition Authority to date. I am relatively new to this office, but I noticed the impact of the Competition Authority on other sectors of the economy and on the public service. I hope its impact will grow over time and be evident in the context of future reports. The consultation process facilitates a variety of groups to respond, make submissions and so on. That in itself creates a lengthy process.</P>
        <P>In terms of the banks, I will be in receipt of the report dated 14 December. I would prefer to study it in some detail before making any further comments on it.</P>

        <Quest>if he has plans for amendments to labour law to provide workers here with some degree of protection in situations in which employers decide to lay workers off and replace them with contract labour from other countries paid at a lower rate and under inferior conditions; if his attention has been drawn to the serious concerns expressed by trade unions regarding the outsourcing of jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of issues have been raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question to which I will respond as follows. I do not propose to amend labour law on redundancy as there are adequate protections in the Redundancy and Unfair Dismissals Acts. Severance terms are a matter for negotiation between employers and employees. However, there are conditions for such arrangements to qualify for funding under the Redundancy Payments Acts. Under the statutory redundancy payments scheme, where an employee is immediately replaced in the same job by another employee, whether from another country or not, a statutory redundancy situation is not deemed to arise.</P>
        <P>In any such situation, the employees concerned who feel they have been unfairly displaced in their employment, can then take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001. There are no distinctions as to employment conditions between Irish and non-Irish workers. All labour law on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to non-national <Col N="993"/>workers working in this country in the same way as it applies to Irish workers. If a non-national worker feels he or she is being treated by his or her employer in a way that breaches any of this employee protection legislation, it will be open to him or her to refer their case for adjudication to a quasi judicial body person such as a Rights Commissioner, the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The composition and skill mix of our labour force continues to change in response to the international pressures, affecting both the manufacturing and service sectors. It is fair to say that our strengths and competitive advantages, especially compared with low wage economies, have fundamentally changed. Ireland&rsquo;s economy is now typified by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards. Ireland has become a more prosperous and wealthy economy, converging with the broad income and prosperity levels of other member states of the EU. I doubt if anyone would have it any other way.</P>
        <P>In a borderless Europe, which places no restrictions on where people can work or where investors can do business, there will always be competition for work and investment. One of the Government&rsquo;s key objectives is to develop a competitive economy that will be resilient to the toughest competitive pressures, either from within the EU or elsewhere. It is committed to making sure that when companies decide to invest, Ireland will retain its reputation as a secure, profitable and world class investment location. I am also committed to Ireland having a participatory society based on social justice. We are all committed to ensuring Ireland is responsive to the constantly evolving requirements of international competitiveness necessary for continuing economic and social success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State gave a very long answer and entirely ignored the core of the question, namely, the challenge posed to Ireland and employment here by the yellow packing of Irish jobs. It is not a matter of redundancy payments, because where a worker is satisfied to accept a redundancy package, where that worker is replaced by someone from a new member state, and where the terms and conditions of the new job are well below the terms enjoyed by the previous occupier of the job, it poses a real and substantial threat to jobs across the economy.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to go into the specifics of the current issues in Irish Ferries where an entire crew operating out of my constituency has been told they will be replaced by a new member state crew, at greatly reduced rates, in a clear effort to reduce costs. If that becomes a pattern for seafarers &mdash; it certainly threatens every seafaring job in Ireland &mdash; no doubt it will spread into other sectors of the economy. Therefore, the question I am posing to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is what response does the Government propose to make to this real and <Col N="994"/>substantial threat to employment and the standards of employment in this State to protect Irish jobs in Ireland, Irish standards and Irish wages?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal issue in the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to amendments to labour laws. There are seven substantive Acts already on the Statute Book, some of which I mentioned in the initial response and which appeared to deal adequately with the situation outlined in the question. The Deputy also referred to the current dispute at Irish Ferries and I am pleased that the parties to the dispute agreed to enter into talks. I take this opportunity to commend the Labour Relations Commission and the parties to the dispute for having done so, because it is important progress.</P>
        <P>I am also aware of the other substantive issue raised by the Deputy, namely, what he referred to as yellow packing of jobs. The remainder of my reply adverted to the fact that conditions in the European and world economies are evolving very quickly and the focus of the Government must be to encourage workers to be up-skilled in order to be able to participate at the highest levels and benefit from the highest levels of pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his philosophical musing, but perhaps he will now answer the question directly. Has the Government a response to the decision of any company in Ireland to yellow pack jobs by disemploying Irish people, employing new member state nationals at greatly reduced standards, wages and conditions, or is the Department and the Government happy to let market forces prevail and talk about up-skilling and so on, while doing nothing specifically to address the real and imminent threat to Irish jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is well tried and tested machinery in this area that has been used successfully in a great number of disputes over a long period. That machinery has come into play in regard to the specific difficulty in Irish Ferries. I certainly would not want to undermine the attempts to address the very serious issues that arise in this area. Under the NIB proposals, which have been accepted by the parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

	<P>It is very difficult to respond. When I responded in specific terms, I was told I should do so in general terms, and when I respond in general terms, I am told I should do so in specific terms.</P>
        <P>The situation in regard to the specific issue is one which has progressed considerably and one which I think will have a positive outcome on the <Col N="995"/>basis of a viable service, which is what is required and is the wish of the Government and of both parties to the dispute.</P>
        <P>The more general question is one which must be addressed across several levels. At the risk of again being accused of being philosophical, there are, as I outlined in my initial reply, a huge range of forces at work that make it impossible for the Government to provide an answer to every philosophical question, except to say that we need to be aware of the forces at work. Let us not pretend that we are able to address them or undermine them from day one, which is what the Government is ultimately committed to doing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received the views of the Competition Authority on the floor size cap contained in the retail planning guidelines. The authority is opposed to a cap on the grounds that it restricts competition in the market and lessens consumer choice.</P>
        <P>The consumer strategy group was set up earlier this year to examine a wide range of consumer issues. While the retail planning guidelines were not specifically referred to in the group&rsquo;s terms of reference, the floor space cap may be under consideration by the group in view of its impact on consumers. I expect to receive the group&rsquo;s report after Christmas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for responding and for telling me the Competition Authority&rsquo;s views. I was particularly interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views. It is interesting that he says he expects to receive a report after Christmas. I thought the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government planned to make a decision before Christmas. Does the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment hope to use the analysis that has been carried out under the auspices of his Department to influence the decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or has he a view on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly I would favour a relaxation of the retail planning guidelines. My Department has consistently supported the Competition Authority in this regard on the grounds that it would facilitate greater competition and greater entry into the market, and that it would be beneficial to consumers.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="996"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the report I referred to, a relaxation will come anyway through the work of the consumer. The consumer strategy group is looking at the matter, particularly from the viewpoint of the consumer.</P>
        <P>When the Government introduced the planning guidelines, a study was undertaken by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The issue is how to balance the maintenance and sustenance of economic activity within city and town centres, and on the other hand try to facilitate competition. There are arguments on both sides. Looking around at what has happened over the past few years, even since the introduction of the capping guidelines, the proliferation of major shopping centres on the outskirts of towns and cities has not been halted.</P>
        <P>The degree to which one can regulate the marketplace is questionable. One can consider the size issue. My personal observation in recent years is of changing patterns in cities and towns in terms of services and economic activities, compared to ten or 15 years ago. Likewise, on the outskirts of cities, close to the link roads and motorways, we are witnessing the development of major retail stores. Again, the issue is one of convenience and of facilitating the shopper and the consumer in terms of where they want to do their major retail shopping. They might want to go to the city centre to do different things.</P>
        <P>This matter has been considered by the Government following the submission by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. He will shortly make an announcement and that is a matter for him. He is talking of a modest relaxation of the guidelines but I prefer to defer to the Minister concerned as it is in his domain in terms of any announcement or ultimate decision in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is implying that we cannot do anything, that shopping centres such as the Liffey Valley Centre, and the Mahon Centre in his own constituency, simply arrive, that the market allows them despite Government regulation, and that we should therefore go along with that policy. Is the Minister concerned that there is a possible further development of that type of concentration which would lead to perhaps four or five major centres around the country servicing all of Ireland as main retail centres? Under such circumstances there would be less employment created and less competition, where one might have one major centre effectively serving the whole of Munster, another serving all of Leinster and so on? That is the international experience. We are relatively small and could easily have four major shopping centres for the whole country. We would then have less competition and less employment. Does the Minister see that as a possibility?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, any monopolising that might occur would have to be dealt with in the context of enforcement, competition law and so <Col N="997"/>on. The Government is not about to remove all the existing guidelines. What has been submitted to the Government is the suggestion for a modest relaxation.</P>
        <P>We must also be mindful of global trends. We cannot ignore what is happening around us. Having talked to colleagues more seasoned than I, it is clear that the arguments put forward by the Deputy were also put forward when supermarkets came to the fore. Calamity was predicted and it was thought the world would collapse. That did not quite happen. In many respects we have seen the alternative emergence of small effective shopping centres too, notwithstanding the development of major ones. There are high levels of quality and standards in many of these with good delivery services and good responsiveness to the consumer. They developed their own niches. One can look at the Spar group, the Centra and Musgrave groups and so on. Many of those have grown. They provide an interesting illustration of what has happened over time. One can look at the island economy and at what happens around the world. We need to be careful that we do not always try to withstand the forces out there in terms of a changing society and a changing way of doing things. We often overstate the degree to which we feel we can control matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The company referred to in the question by the Deputy has issued High Court proceedings against F&Aacute;S and these proceedings are currently ongoing. In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter raised by the Deputy while these proceedings are extant.</P>
        <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was commissioned by the F&Aacute;S executive and I understand that progress has been made in the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The objective is to ensure that best practice and quality assurance is maintained in the delivery of the construction health and safety schemes operated by F&Aacute;S. Any outstanding matters relating to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns will be addressed when the legal proceedings have been concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister for State to name the company. There is a sensitivity about naming it, but it is Omlink. It operates as an assessment centre in Trim, County Meath, where 250 workers sought training under the construc<Col N="998"/>tion skills programme which is recognised by FETAC. Those 250 workers who were obliged to undergo training for the purposes of gaining qualifications for working on sites under the building regulations, did not receive that training. Will the Minister for State say if re-training is currently being carried out for workers who should have been trained by the company but were not? How much did each person have to pay to participate in that course? How much did the company draw down from them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that 239 people have been offered retraining by F&Aacute;S arising from the difficulties relating to Omlink. The offer has been made to the people involved and full training will be made available to them in lieu of the difficulties which came to light. In the interim, F&Aacute;S has introduced an entirely new system for the training of people in the construction area and I understand this is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for State does not know how much money was drawn down by the company. I understand that Omlink drew down about &euro;100,000 from the participation of those trainees. It is outrageous that the Minister of State should say today that 239 people are being retrained when this matter was brought to the notice of F&Aacute;S in February 2003. There are construction skills people on building sites over the past two years who are untrained, which is the direct responsibility of the company involved. F&Aacute;S knew about this in February 2003 when it received a complaint from a west of Ireland construction company. Nothing was done.</P>
        <P>Was the Fraud Squad brought in? The sum of &euro;100,000 was drawn down by this company. What effort is the Minister making to retrieve this money from the company? Will he confirm what fraud investigations took place, because in effect this is fraud at its worst? What was done by F&Aacute;S or by the Minister, as far back as February 2003, to seek redress from the company, to seek the return of the money, to bring this company to heel and take it off the assessment list?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said at the outset, this matter is currently subject to legal proceedings and it is a matter for the courts rather than for me to adjudicate on whether fraudulent activity has taken place. F&Aacute;S has provided the opportunity of alternative training for the people involved and when the matter before the court has been cleared up, the intention is to pursue the company for the moneys mentioned by Deputy Hogan.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very much aware of the current situation in Mitchelstown and north Cork generally. I visited the town on 12 November last when I had meetings with the company in question, union representatives and local business and community interests. I had a further meeting with the chief executive officer of the company on 6 December last.</P>
        <P>The company in question is restructuring, which is necessary to maintain the viability and profitability of the company and to continue to provide significant employment in the area. It has also, however, necessitated significant job losses over the past 12 months, 500 of them on a voluntary basis. I have had a full and frank exchange of views with all the interested parties and I will continue to keep very much in touch with the developing situation.</P>
        <P>On a day to day basis, the industrial development agencies are actively involved in promoting Mitchelstown and north Cork generally for industrial development. IDA Ireland markets north Cork, including Mitchelstown, as one area. A business expansion scheme building has been completed in Mitchelstown and is being actively marketed. The current primary focus of IDA Ireland is nearby Fermoy where a new business and technology park is being developed. Enterprise Ireland is working directly with the company in question both as regards rationalisation and future plans for the company. A capital grant of &euro;200,000 has been approved by Enterprise Ireland for a food enterprise centre in Mitchelstown.</P>
        <P>As regards the industrial base in Mitchelstown, I am concerned at the over-reliance on the food and dairy sector. I would like to see the industrial base broadened and expanded to include other industries. I have asked the development agencies to see what can be done in this regard. The initial priority is to secure inward investment for the country as a whole in an environment where we are competing against other countries for decreasing investment volumes. The location within Ireland is a consideration for each project on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>A socio-economic study of Mitchelstown is under way. It is being funded by local interests, including the company in question. An independent chairman has been appointed to facilitate the drafting of a plan for the area. An interim report is due in February 2005. I will continue to be actively involved in the future development of the Mitchelstown area.</P>

	<P>I have a number of questions arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Will he accept that north Cork and Mitchelstown in particular is an economic blackspot? There are a number of such blackspots, notwithstanding the overall good economic and job situation in the country, which need specific attention. Has he any proposals to deal with areas, even within the so-called developed regions, that have been extremely hard hit by the contraction of traditional industries.</P>
        <P>As regards Mitchelstown in particular, when will the socio-economic study the Minister mentioned in his reply be available? What specific steps has he taken to achieve the diversification of employment that he has indicated should happen to lessen dependence on the food sector for Mitchelstown? As regards the movement of jobs from Mitchelstown in north Cork, to the business park at Cork Airport, has he any views on the migration of employment from areas that need jobs most to places which might need them as much and has he any serious plan to lessen inducements for that type of migration and ensure that it cannot happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like to use the term &ldquo;economic blackspot&rdquo;. Taking north Cork in its entirety, I do not accept that it is an economic blackspot. I accept, however, that the region has suffered significant job losses, out of proportion to the average trend across the country. I also accept the Deputy&rsquo;s basic point that there are certain areas of the country that have not benefited as well as other regions or area in the context of a relatively robust national employment scene, and that this requires specific attention. I have asked both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as well as the enterprise boards to work together with F&Aacute;S on the training side, to examine the profiles in each of these areas. That is important as regards the demographic and skills profiles and so forth for identifying the type of interventions that may be made to support those areas. In terms of foreign direct investment, I would like to see the focus placed on companies to locate in these areas, if possible. That might require the State to ensure that certain facilities are put in place in those areas to facilitate such initiatives, as regards educational and infrastructural aspects. I ask Enterprise Ireland to work with indigenous companies in these regions to see if they can enhance their value-added output. In the case of Mitchelstown, I believe there is significant potential on the food side, linking Dairygold with Moorepark research centre and UCC, we believe synergy can be achieved which would allow new products to be developed. That would obviously be attractive on the export side and in particular on the nutraceutical side, that is, the development of foods with a strong health content and impact in terms of probiotics and ingredients that are beneficial to the body. We believe there is a significant potential for such development in the Irish food industry generally, but not least in the Dairygold area in Mitchelstown.</P><Col N="1001"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 11, 18, 21, 22, 26, 28, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 49, 50, 51, 53, 55, 61, 65, 70, 74, 75, 77, 79, 81 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The Enterprise Strategy Group was established by An T&aacute;naiste to prepare a report that would serve as a blueprint for an enterprise strategy for growth and employment in Ireland. Under its terms of reference, the group was asked to develop a medium term enterprise strategy and to propose and prioritise national policy responses which would strengthen the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise environment; promote the emergence of an innovative and knowledge driven economy; ensure balanced regional development; sustain, where feasible, those industries already providing significant employment; underpin the industries of the future where Ireland is or can become a substantial player with particular reference to segments of the ICT, life sciences, food, financial services and internationally traded services sectors; encourage business start ups and companies with potential for growth; and examine the scope for increasing the value of sectors to the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
        <P>In this context the group was asked to take into account a number of important domestic and external factors that will determine our future growth potential. These included long-term international trends in globalisation, EU enlargement, technology and regulation, as well as in the developing structure of industries and markets and Ireland&rsquo;s increased prosperity and changing cost and competitiveness base. The Government <Col N="1006"/>considered the report of the Enterprise Strategy Group, in advance of its publication on 7 July last. Given the large number of recommendations made and the fact that they impacted on a number of Departments and their agencies, the Government decided to set up a high level committee to consider the implications of the report and the best manner to address its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The report contains some 51 recommendations, approximately half of which are appropriate to Departments other than my own. Accordingly, ten Departments were represented on the committee. Given the widespread nature of these recommendations, their importance and, in certain cases their complexity, detailed analyses and extensive consultations were required. My understanding is that the committee expects to finalise its report in the near future and I propose to present it to the Cabinet immediately thereafter.</P>
        <P>My intention is that a specific plan should be drafted on each recommendation to be implemented. These plans would be closely monitored to ensure their implementation within a specified timeframe. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific recommendations in advance of receiving the report of the high level committee and communicating my own views to the Government, I am aware that some of recommendations it contains reflect initiatives already underway or envisaged in Departments and agencies. For example, prior to the publication of the Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s report in July of this year, the Government on 22 June 2004 approved a new co-ordination and governance system for STI, which included the establishment of the position of chief science adviser to the Government, a post that was filled with effect from 1 September.</P>
        <P>I do not need to outline the challenges we face in an increasingly competitive environment. The decisions we make now must ensure that we remain a dynamic economy. I look forward, therefore, to receiving the report of the high level committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an example of the Government stalling over the past six months. Anything that was in the pipeline six months prior to the reshuffle did not happen and not much will happen in the six months after. While I accept that this was a broad-ranging and complex report, my particular question referred to recommendations for change for which the Minister has sole responsibility in his Department. That does not necessarily need to await the recommendations of a committee of ten representatives from other Departments to allow the Minister to make a decision on whether he will pursue change. I refer to the development of Enterprise Ireland and its role in enterprise strategy. It is difficult for him to answer all the questions that have been <Col N="1007"/>addressed to him, but does he wish to make any comment on the broad structures of Enterprise Ireland? It is one small area where we could begin to implement some of the changes outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reshuffle has had nothing to do with the fact that the high level committee has not reported back. It has not come back with final recommendations but has done so on an interim basis and I made observations on some of the recommendations. We should be in a position by the end of January to bring it before the Government. In the interim period, that has not stopped action. Enterprise Ireland has been carrying out a significant degree of internal strategic thinking with a view to revising and reorganising its structures. I had a fruitful meeting with members of Enterprise Ireland last week. It lasted a few hours and we looked at that issue and discussed the future ambition of the agency and the targets it has set itself for 2005 and 2006. Enterprise Ireland, its chairman, chief executive officer and board are dovetailing with the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group. It should be able to outline its position in January on this, but significant progress has been made on that front.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that some analysis needs to be done within Government on the recommendations of the report. However, the recent budget did not contain any recommendation that could be discerned as being influenced by the work done by the enterprise strategy group. That shows a remarkable inability of the Government to act on the very thing that the report highlights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>What is that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main recommendations of the report is that the Government needs to act quickly and to show flexibility. The report took a year to produce and I am sure the recommendations did not come as a bolt from the blue. Despite this, the budget announced four months later was not influenced in any way by such a strategy. That is a remarkable example of a lack of flexibility and a lack of reaction from the Government. Such flexibility was one of the central tenets of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not waited for the outcome of the high level technical group for progress to be made on a range of areas covered by the report. I have outlined significant work undertaken by Enterprise Ireland. With regard to research, the Government acted quickly on the report and appointed a chief scientific adviser to co-ordinate all the science, technology and research and development agendas. There will be a meeting next week on an interdepartmental committee on research to co-ordinate the <Col N="1008"/>research activities of all the Departments. It will also begin preparing work for the Cabinet sub-committee on research which I will establish.</P>
        <P>I addressed a gathering in UCD on research committing the Government to the Lisbon Agenda. I have further refined that by trying to prepare an action plan to ensure we can reach the targets outlined in the Lisbon Agenda on research by 2010. I have asked the group and the interdepartmental committee to draw up a roadmap for research by mid-2005. We have made much progress in recent years in the programme for third level research in education, which I established myself, as well as Science Foundation Ireland, which was established by the T&aacute;naiste. We now need to step it up even more, but we must take concrete steps to reach the 2.5% of gross national product that is recommended by the Lisbon Agenda for spending on research and development. Whatever is required for the next five or six years, the roadmap will enable us to be aware of it and we should then make the necessary resources available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect to announce the form the restructuring may take? Will he publicly announce it? Does he believe it will include specific recommendations on Shannon Development and its possible future connection to Enterprise Ireland? When does he expect to announce that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be ideal if the responses of the Government and Enterprise Ireland to the ESG report were delivered in tandem. Enterprise Ireland is well on the way to announcing its plans, but that is a matter for Enterprise Ireland. Its representatives have consulted me and are anxious that I would be with them on that. I have been very impressed with the initial meetings that I have had with Enterprise Ireland, its focus and the ambitious targets set for the next few years.</P>
        <P>A group has been working on Shannon. There are certain issues that are not as straightforward as one might like. Different Departments must consult on different issues, which are linked with the issue of Shannon Airport, the authority and the financial underpinning of the new independent airport. Those consultations are continuing. I cannot say whether that specific issue will have been resolved by the time the Government considers this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister given any thought to strategies that might improve the supply of scientists and engineers? In Ireland and in the UK, some of those subjects have become extremely unpopular and we may have a problem in labour supply in future. Would the Minister support the fundamental reforms which the university heads seem to be pursuing at present?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1009"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the reform agenda of the heads of the various universities. It is important that they are facilitated because the governance structures that emerge from those reforms would be more robust and more responsive to the needs of the universities. They will also help to achieve a synergy with the national objectives of enterprise, job creation and research. It is not necessarily bad for education to have a strong relationship with industry. It will obviously have its core functions. Education can benefit from the world of business and industry and <i>vice versa</i>. We need strong collaboration between industry and education. The CSETs, which are the major research projects initiated by Science Foundation Ireland, are very significant advances on anything that we have had before between industry and universities and institutes of technology. They allow for and facilitate a major industrial input and a significant financial package for the universities in the context of attracting back world class researchers or giving our indigenous world class researchers an opportunity to get involved in cutting edge research. We would expect products, added value and so forth to emerge from those research enterprises.</P>
        <P>With regard to science and engineering, the Government has agreed to co-ordinate the activities of the various agencies around one major Discover Science agenda. Recently, Discover Science week was held. It was co-ordinated by Forf&aacute;s and involved F&Aacute;S, the Department of Education and Science and my Department and it reaches into primary and second level schools. There is room for more development on that front in terms of awareness, examining the second level subjects and the curriculum for the traditional technology subjects. I understand work is being done by the NCCA in that regard.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties and resource implications, it is important that we modernise the context in which those subjects are taught in second level schools to allow for a better throughput. Ireland, however, still has the highest number of science and engineering graduates between the ages of 20 and 34 years in the OECD, which gives the country a good competitive edge.</P>

	<P>I will return to the issue of Shannon because it is an example of the inability of the Government to make quick decisions. To respond to a question on enterprise development in the mid-west region by acknowledging that it is complicated because there is an airport in the area and by referring to other matters which do not really relate to the key issue of enterprise development is surprising, as is the inability to give a direct answer. It is worrying for the mid-west and Shannon region if we let it be caught in older arguments regarding infrastructural issues <Col N="1010"/>which are not relevant to the fast rapid responses we will need in an information technology economy. The Government appears to be caught in the <i>status quo</i> and unable to make a quick decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The airport in Shannon is important because it is key economic infrastructure. It will be a significant factor in the ongoing growth of the mid-west in tourism and industry and in the general economic and business life of the region. The Green Party always claimed to encourage and nurture the concept of consultation with the various players and the community. That is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>There must be a process of consultation. People have strong views about this in the region. They have strong views about the role of Shannon Development and its importance to how the region develops. We could override that but I hope the Deputy will agree that engaging in the type of structured and informed consultation in which we are engaged is a reasonable response to the concerns and issues which have been raised locally and regionally.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to Irish companies that have traded in dual-use goods with organisations that are based in states that have been the subject of resolutions by the UN Commission on Human Rights in the course of the past ten years; and if he will supply details of such transactions.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Accessible records in respect of dual-use licences are only available for the period since 1996. Details of dual-use export licences issued to Irish companies since 1996 in respect of countries that have been the subject of resolutions by the UN Commission on Human Rights in the course of the past ten years are contained in the tabular statement which will be circulated to the House.</P>
        <P>Exports of dual-use goods are administered in accordance with the EU regulation for the control of dual-use goods and technology. In assessing applications for export licences, a number of considerations are taken into account, including: the end-user; obligations and commitments which arise from membership of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements or by ratification of relevant international treaties; the country of final destination with particular reference to its membership of non-proliferation regimes, its respect for human rights, and the existence of any internal or external conflict; obligations under sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council or agreed in other international fora.</P>

	<?oasys _cl11.5-?><P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor promised legislation on the issue of Irish manufacture of military and security equipment and dual-use components. That was to be based on the report which was commissioned by Forf&aacute;s on military and dual-use goods exports. Does the Minister intend to pursue this issue by following up on the recommendations in that report, which was published in July 2004? Its main recommendations were that a system of checks was needed to identify firms that might be breaching export controls, that we should prepare and publish an annual report on licensed exports in arms and dual-use products to be laid before the Oireachtas each year and that we introduce tight arms control legislation to close loopholes that could enable arms brokers to operate in<?oasys _jy?>Ireland.</P>
        <P>Is this an area in which the Minister believes he will be able to introduce such legislation? The key issue is to have clarity and certainty about what this country is producing and where it is going. My understanding from the details of the report Amnesty International has produced on this area is that the lack of certainty or clarity is a deep concern for that organisation and for many people here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty with national legislation on this is that regulation of trade in dual-use equipment is a matter of EU regulation and is governed by Council Regulation No. 1334/2000 of 22 June 2000. That is the legal instrument establishing a Community system to control exports of dual-use equipment and technology. It has been updated on a number of occasions. The purpose of these updates has generally been to bring the list of specified dual-use items up to date, in line with EU member states&rsquo; undertakings in the various international non-proliferation agreements.</P>
        <P>The overall implication of the existence of this regulation is that the list of dual-use items subject to control is now a matter for the European Union policy agenda, not Ireland&rsquo;s. However, Ireland has some flexibility with regard to how it implements the regulation and the Department has some discretion in that regard. The content of the regulation, particularly the list of defined dual-use items, is a matter for EU common decisions as part of EU internal market and common external trade policy provisions.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for trade is unable to be here this afternoon but I will refer the Deputy&rsquo;s comments to him regarding domestic legislation and ask him to revert to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 17 together.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in the mid-term review of part two of Sustaining Progress, the Labour Court has been asked to review the national minimum wage and this review is currently under way. As provided for in the legislation, the Labour Court will consult with such persons as it thinks appropriate in undertaking its examination of the minimum wage. If the Labour Court is satisfied that general agreement is reached between the parties as to an appropriate minimum wage, it will recommend the rate agreed. If, on the other hand, agreement is not reached between the parties, the Labour Court may still make a recommendation but in doing so it shall have regard to certain matters, such as the likely impact on employment and inflation.</P>
        <P>I hope any recommendation arising from this review will be made known to me by the end of January 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What effect will the review have on those who were removed from the tax net as a result of measures in budget 2005? Does the Minister expect that some or all of them will find themselves back in the tax net after May 2005? How many disputes have been brought to the labour inspectorate in the Department in respect of the minimum wage since it was introduced? Has the Minister data on the rate of compliance by employers with the requirements of the National Minimum Wage Act? If the Minister does not have that data or statistical information readily available, perhaps he would undertake to provide it to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know at this stage what new minimum wage level will be recommended and am not, therefore, in a position to judge its impact on the changes announced in the budget. Any increase is likely to expose only a small proportion of a minimum-wage income to taxation according to the current bands.</P>
        <P>In 2003, 950 inspections were carried out. A total of 435 were carried out this year to the end of November. Breaches of the Act were found in approximately 12% of inspections carried out between July and November 2004. I understand <Col N="1015"/>a similar rate of breaches obtains in figures for other periods. Approximately 57,000 people employed in non-agricultural firms in the private sector are on the minimum wage, which is 4.5% of the labour force. Approximately 14.6% of part-time workers earn the national minimum wage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The information provided in the latter part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply refers to matters arising from inspections. Can he refer to my question on the number of disputes which may have been brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate within the Department? Does he have information on the number of disputes arising since the introduction of the minimum wage? Is there a method apart from inspection employed to ascertain the level of compliance across the board rather than with reference to a statistical selection of cases arising from inspections? Is there a means by which all employment positions are appraised and assessed and statistics produced?</P>
        <P>Will the review examine the terms of the minimum wage in the context of section 15 of the National Minimum Wage Act which provides that young workers may receive a wage less than the minimum wage? In many cases, to my knowledge and I am sure the knowledge of other Deputies, young people work as hard and for as many hours as older counterparts but do not receive the same minimum wage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what submissions have been made to the Labour Court on the minimum wage. It may well be that the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in have been raised. I do not know if there will be an agreement or what recommendations the Labour Court will make.</P>
        <P>The 4.5% statistic I quoted is an ESRI estimate for 2003. While I have information that there were 950 labour inspections, I do not know how many arose from complaints or what circumstances begat them. I will seek to obtain more detailed information if it is available and forward it to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any company been prosecuted on foot of the inspections for failing to observe the law and regulations on the minimum wage? My colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, tabled a question on the significant proportion of the workforce composed of immigrant workers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with Question No. 17.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State provide any assurance to such workers, especially those from outside the European Union, that the allegations heard from time to time of flagrant <Col N="1016"/>abuses of the minimum wage legislation are untrue and that the situation is being monitored closely? The increase in the minimum wage, which I hope will be significant, will almost certainly bring people back into the tax net next year. Has the Department carried out any study to determine the appropriate level of minimum wage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In keeping with the appropriate approach to raising the minimum wage, I intend to wait for the recommendation of the Labour Court. The same level of employment protection is available to non-national workers as obtains for national workers. As with any such body, the labour inspectorate is dependent to an extent on the bringing of matters to its attention. We encourage people to do so on their own behalf or on behalf of others. While I do not have the figures on minimum wage cases, the inspectorate has been successful in court on a considerable number of occasions. A number of cases are before the courts and there have been several successful prosecutions on foot of the actions of the labour inspectorate.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Last May, when Deputy Martin was Minister for Health and Children, I asked him to investigate the disgraceful circumstances of a patient suffering from scoliosis who was forced to travel from Galway to Dublin for treatment because the Western Health Board would not acquire the necessary equipment to allow him to be treated in Galway. Unfortunately, nothing has changed during the intervening seven months. The patient continues to be subjected to appalling treatment. He is not the only patient in the Western Health Board area suffering in this way.</P>
        <P>Family members are at their wits end and have gone public in an attempt to secure the necessary treatment in Galway. As this appalling matter is now in the public domain, I will record its details and outline the case to allow the Minister of State to understand it fully and act to address it. The patient is a 23 year old man from Tuam in County Galway who suffers from cerebral palsy, epilepsy and scoliosis, which is a deformity of the spine. He is fed through his stomach, requires a colostomy bag and has now contracted the MRSA bug. <Col N="1018"/>He is completely immobile and must be accompanied by a member of his family at all times. He is in constant pain and requires constant morphine to control it. A pump has been fitted inside his skin to feed the morphine into his system gradually which must be refilled every two weeks. The patient must be taken on a six-hour return ambulance journey from Galway to Dublin for the procedure which takes ten minutes to perform.</P>
        <P>His fragile state of health means he is not fit for the journey which takes a terrible toll on him and results in a prolonged hospital stay in either Dublin or Galway. On one occasion after an ambulance trip to Dublin he had to remain in hospital for ten weeks as a result of complications. His mother had to stay with him in hospital in Dublin for that time. Dr. O&rsquo;Keeffe, a pain specialist in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, has been very good to the patient and his family. The doctor has offered to instruct a medical person in Galway on the procedures to be carried out, but this offer has not been accepted by the Western Health Board. I am informed that all that is required is a clean hospital area and an anaesthetist to carry out the procedure in a mere ten minutes. The pump was fitted about four years ago and at first the procedure only had to be carried out every three months. That has been reduced now to every two weeks and as time progresses it is expected that the need will become more frequent, resulting in even more hardship for the patient because of having to travel to Dublin.</P>
        <P>The patient&rsquo;s family love him very much. His mother and father, with whom he lives, give him full-time care in a loving way. His sisters, who live locally, give every support to their parents in looking after the patient. His sisters are there to attend to his needs at all times as required. The family has excelled in coping with all the patient&rsquo;s illnesses, but they are weary having to cope with everything and at having been treated in such a cold manner by the Western Health Board. This family needs the support of the State. They need this service in Galway, which would require little funding to put in place. They need the support of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>What I have outlined is an appalling case. This patient is being treated appallingly by the Western Health Board. The Minister of State has responsibility for this matter and his senior Minister has final responsibility. He should not allow this situation continue for a day longer. In the patient&rsquo;s interests, in the interests of his parents and sisters and in the interests of humanity, I beg the Minister to act now, give a boost to this patient and his family for Christmas and engage with the Western Health Board to bring this appalling injustice to an end.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The provision of health services for people who live in County Galway is primarily a matter for the Western Health Board and that will remain the case until 1 January next. The Department of Health and Children has made inquiries from the board about the case referred to by the Deputy. I have been advised that the person is attending St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, on a regular basis and that the services the patient requires are being provided there. I commend Deputy McHugh for raising this matter. I understand from the Western Health Board that the person&rsquo;s general practitioner has offered to assist with the provision of the service to the person referred to by the Deputy if and when required.</P>
        <P>The Government has prioritised the health services for investment. Since 1997, substantial additional funding and staff have been provided for the health services in the west to ensure increased levels of clinical activity, new procedures, better treatments and greater numbers of patients availing of the services. The Government will continue to invest in developing services for persons from the west. For example, we have provided unprecedented capital funding to upgrade and provide for new services at University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
        <P>The Western Health Board was unable to provide the service referred to by the Deputy at University College Hospital, Galway, in 2004. However, the board has informed the Department that it will consider the matter in the context of its 2005 service plan. I commend the Deputy again on raising this issue on the last sitting day of the D&aacute;il before we adjourn for the Christmas recess and I hope this case can be attended to. I will attend to it myself to determine whether the matter can be followed up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for the last time this year. The issue I want to raise concerns the prisoner who was given compassionate temporary release from Mountjoy Prison to visit his seriously ill mother in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice in Harold&rsquo;s Cross. There is something of the Keystone Cops about this case. The prisoner was released in handcuffs with three prison officers attending. He escaped. He visited his mother at that time and, apparently, visited her a second time yesterday morning. The prisoner is still at large and nobody appears to know what is happening.</P>
        <P>I agree with the policy of compassionate leave, and it is important that that is part and parcel of a prisoner&rsquo;s rehabilitation process, but questions arise in this case because the prisoner had only <Col N="1020"/>started a ten year sentence for armed robbery with assault. In those circumstances it is unusual for the prisoner to be allowed compassionate release. On many occasions I sought compassionate release for somebody who had a much shorter sentenced to serve yet the Department, by and large, refused the request.</P>
        <P>First, why was this prisoner, who had served only a short part of a long sentence, granted compassionate release? Second, if this prisoner was in handcuffs and under strong escort, why were the handcuffs taken off? I can understand that would be appropriate considering he was visiting a seriously ill parent but surely the three prison officers in attendance would have been able to position themselves in such a way around the room to ensure the prisoner could not escape. To make matters worse, having had his first visit with his mother he went back to the hospice at 7.30 a.m. yesterday, bewigged and disguised and without the prison officers or the handcuffs, and visited her again. He left the hospice following the visit and remains at large.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on what happened, why it happened, the progress on apprehending the person who has absconded and the guidelines and measures that are likely to be introduced to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to elaborate to the best of my ability and give the information at the disposal of the officers in the Department. On behalf of the Minister, I advise the House that escorts take place outside prison walls for a variety of reasons, including visits to hospitals and court, transfer to other prisons or on humanitarian grounds. Many thousands of escorts take place each year with a significant number of those being for compassionate reasons, such as visits to sick or dying relatives, or funeral homes or gravesides. Such releases are extremely important for prisoners and are very rarely abused. Deputies on all sides of the House are familiar with intervening with the Department to secure the necessary discretion to accommodate such arrangements.</P>
        <P>It is the nature of prison escorts that there is always an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison. However, it is a very rare occurrence for prisoners to attempt to escape during such escorts. A balance must be struck between security and the need to operate a humanitarian prison system. It is a question of managing the risk involved. This is reflected in the number of prison staff accompanying the prisoner. Obviously, there are other cases where the level of risk dictates refusal of the request. However, requests are accommodated where possible.</P>
        <P>Decisions on requests for escorted outings are made, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by senior officers in <Col N="1021"/>the Irish Prison Service. In some cases, they are submitted to the Minister. The incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on Sunday, 12 December this year. The prisoner had made a request to visit his mother who is terminally ill in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice, Harold&rsquo;s Cross. An escorted outing was approved on compassionate grounds by a senior officer of the Irish Prison Service. The prisoner visited his mother on Saturday, 11 December 2004 and again the following day as her condition deteriorated. He also had a previous visit without incident. All visits were accompanied by three prison officers and approval was on the basis that the prisoner was to be handcuffed at all times. During the visit on Sunday, at which a prison chaplain was also in attendance, the prisoner escaped from the hospice.</P>
        <P>The prisoner was serving sentences totalling ten years for robbery, assault and other offences, and is due for release in June 2009. An investigation is being carried out by the Governor of Mountjoy Prison into the incident. I am sure Deputy Costello will appreciate that the Minister is unable to comment in detail at this stage as the investigation is ongoing and he does not wish to prejudice the outcome of any proceedings that may arise out of the incident. However, initial reports suggest that the prisoner slipped the handcuffs, escaped via a patio door and made his getaway into the grounds before scaling a boundary wall. An officer was injured while in pursuit. Staff contacted the prison, which in turn notified the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The full report of the investigation into the incident will be forwarded to the Director General of the Prison Service and to the Minister. The Minister fully understands that such incidents cause public concern and, to safeguard both the prison staff and the general public, every precaution must be taken to prevent their recurrence.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>
        <P>Tullamore College has an excellent reputation as a fine education provider in a growing town. The school has a very good teaching staff and exam results have improved in recent years. In addition, the school has an excellent gym facility which is continually in use by the school and sporting organisations in the area.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The school has a large catchment area stretching from Daingean to the edge of Clara. In 2001 the school had a student population of 600. At that time it was granted approval for an extension with funding of £1.2 million agreed. This included new classrooms as well as a new science laboratory, as the school has placed a great emphasis on the development of the sciences.</P><Col N="1022"/>
        <P>In June 2001, two thirds of the school was burned in a fire. From that point all planning stopped. The extension was not built and permanent buildings did not replace the burnt two-thirds of the school. All that has been provided is a series of temporary accommodation units on a smaller scale than that destroyed. Most of the school now consists of temporary buildings. This is an unacceptable situation. It was bad enough to have to face the aftermath of a fire but to find that the Department had turned its back on the school at the same time was appalling.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;80,000 was recently spent on fixing the roof of the prefabricated accommodation so that the school could re-open in September 2004. While this was necessary to facilitate the re-opening of the school, spending such sums on patch-up work hardly represents value for money.</P>
        <P>In reply to questions of mine on this issue the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor said the Department is of the opinion that the accommodation now available is adequate and capable of serving the school&rsquo;s needs for several years. I have visited the school many times and I do not think that is the case. The school urgently needs to be provided with proper permanent accommodation. Space is available on a valuable site in the heart of the town. Deputy Noel Dempsey, when Minister for Education and Science, told me, in a letter dated 20 September 2004, that the school would be included in his review of all school building projects which were not included in 2004.</P>
        <P>Tullamore is a fast growing town and the commission on school accommodation has projected an 8% to 10% growth over the coming years. Junior infant intake at the local primary schools is growing and the town expects more than 200 jobs by 2008 under the decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider this issue. I invite the Minister to visit the school when she next visits the building unit, which is only up the road from the school. A mother whose son is in a junior certificate class recently told me he has never been in a permanent school structure at either primary or post-primary level in the town. Surely this is not the best we can offer the children of Tullamore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Enright for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House how the Department of Education and Science is meeting the accommodation needs of Tullamore College in County Offaly. The building and planning unit of the Department is located in the town and it is easy to stand over the record of the Department in this matter.</P>
        <P>In 1996 County Offaly VEC applied for capital funding for the college towards the provision of two additional classrooms. Following an examination of the long-term accommodation needs of the school, the Department approved an extension and refurbishment project based on a projected long-term enrolment of 650 pupils.</P><Col N="1023"/>
        <P>A design team was subsequently appointed and the project had advanced to a stage one-two submission when the school was damaged by fire in 2001. Following this incident, the options open to the Department were to carry out re-instatement works on and extend the existing buildings or to provide a new building. In each of these scenarios, the school would be facilitated in temporary accommodation pending completion of the major works. It was envisaged that the cost of either option would be met partly from insurance money and partly from money that would be set aside under the capital programme. However, given the urgency of recommencing the school, the proceeds from the insurance claim were used by the VEC for the rental and installation of a significant amount of temporary accommodation, as well as for carrying out re-instatement works and upgrading external areas. The temporary accommodation in question is of a very high quality and has a long life span. Consequently, the Department of Education and Science subsequently purchased it outright at a cost of more than &euro;300,000 in March of this year. It was made clear to the VEC at that time that the temporary accommodation combined with the re-instatement works would be capable of meeting the school&rsquo;s needs for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The Department continues to support minor improvement works at the school concerned. In <Col N="1024"/>this regard, roof repair works were carried out at a cost of &euro;82,144 during 2004. In addition, under the summer works scheme for 2004, the Department grant aided an upgrade of the schools gas system at a cost of &euro;15,000.</P>
        <P>The school has applied under the 2005 summer works scheme for additional funding for further works and this will be considered in the context of an assessment of all applications received. The Department intends to publish a list of the successful applicants in February next.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter in the House.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 25 and 46 together.</P>
        <P>The preparatory stages of the Employment Permits Bill have taken longer than expected, because of the change in labour market. In particular, with effect from 1 May 2004, nationals of the ten new member states of the European Union are entitled to work here without restriction. This initiative has opened up further the Irish labour market with Irish employers now having access to a labour pool of some 220 millions from the European Economic Area, EEA. The EEA comprises the member states of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and effectively Switzerland. It is also necessary to bring greater clarity and simplicity to the original draft Bill. As this is now being achieved, I intend to publish the Bill in the next D&aacute;il session.</P>
        <P>At present the work permit system grants a permit to an employer to recruit a specific employee to fill a specific vacancy, where the employer has been unable to find a suitable employee within the European Economic Area. This arrangement applies only to highly skilled and highly paid positions. The work permit is granted to the employer in the interest of traceability, the enforcement of the employees&rsquo; rights and administrative efficiency.</P><Col N="1026"/>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>In addition, where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, my Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid &mdash; P60 and other sources are used.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure, as far as possible, that rights and entitlements under Irish law are being observed for all workers. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting emigrant workers I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>
        <P>Persons employed in Ireland under the work permit scheme in recent years have been facilitated readily in changing jobs and in such circumstances a new work permit is issued to the person&rsquo;s new employer. This flexibility has been possible by the high number of vacancies arising in recent years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established by ministerial order on 13 April 2004. From 1 June 2004 all personal injury claims arising from workplace accidents, where an employee is seeking compensation from his-her employer, must be referred to the Personal Injuries Assess<Col N="1027"/>ment Board before legal proceedings are issued. From 22 July 2004, all motor liability and public liability claims must also be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued.</P>
        <P>The structure and staffing levels of the PIAB have been agreed. The PIAB, when fully operational, will have a staffing complement of up to 85 in addition to the CEO. The PIAB is also utilising an outsourced service centre to assist injured parties in completion of their claim submissions and ensure a comprehensive, fair and independent service is provided.</P>
        <P>The actual recruitment of staff is an operational matter for which the CEO of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has responsibility. However, I understand that following a significant recruitment campaign, the PIAB has recruited sufficient staff to serve the current needs of its business.</P>
        <P>While matters relating to the claims received by PIAB is also an operational matter for which the CEO has responsibility, the latest available figures to me show that up until 10 December, 9,392 calls had been received, 555,532 website hits had been recorded, and a total of 2,125 applications for assessment had been made, broken down as follows: 710 employer liability applications, 587 public liability applications, and 828 motor accident applications.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the PIAB will lead to reduced insurance premia to the benefit of both consumers and businesses alike. By eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation. The PIAB will also offer speedier assessments to the benefit of claimants.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 62 together.</P>
        <P>My Department no longer regulates insurance undertakings. This responsibility has passed to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Auth<Col N="1028"/>ority, IFSRA, under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who holds overall responsibility for policy and legislation in relation to the provision of financial services in Ireland. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, has taken over the lead role in relation to policy and legislation on the availability and cost of motor insurance and any related inter-departmental co-ordination. The primary ongoing insurance focus of my Department will be from the horizontal competitiveness perspective and competition in conjunction with the Competition Authority. My Department also retains responsibility for the Personnel Injuries Assessment Board.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the conclusion in the final report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, that there is scope for motor insurance premia to fall further, and while there have been significant reductions in the cost of motor insurance, as the following points illustrate, I am satisfied that there is indeed scope for further reductions.</P>
        <P>Central Statistics Office, CSO, consumer price index statistics show that there was a reduction of 20% in motorcar insurance between April 2002, when the first MIAB report was published, and October 2004. Examples provided by MIAB for three specific companies between March 2003 and March 2004 indicates the following reductions: 10% to 16% in comprehensive insurance for a 30 year old male; 10% to 41% in comprehensive insurance for a 50 year old female; and 10% to 45% for third party, fire and theft insurance for a 21 year old male.</P>
        <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents governments from intervening directly in relation to premium levels. However, governments are free to take measures to improve the operation of the insurance market. Recent measures taken under the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme have led to a better functioning insurance market. This is reflected in the significant underwriting profits in the insurance industry as reported by IFSRA in its first insurance statistical review of October 2003, previously published by my Department.</P>
        <P>The new operating conditions enhance the attractiveness of the market to prospective new entrants and while the premium reductions we have seen to date are welcome, I would expect further premium reductions from the new market conditions now in place. Competition from new entrants attracted by better market conditions will be an important element in ensuring continuing downward pressure on premia. The recent authorisation of five new entrants to operate in the Irish market will make a further important contribution in this regard. The report of the study undertaken jointly by my Department and the Competition Authority will be published early in 2005. This will provide further insights and make recommendations to further improve the competitive aspect of the insurance market.</P>

        <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that all possible steps have been taken to protect the interests of former employees of Irish Fertiliser Industries, who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation of the company; if, in particular, his attention has been drawn to the fact that some of these employees may now receive as little as 25% of their pension entitlements; if, in view of the fact that he was the majority shareholder in the company when it was decided to appoint a liquidator, he will reconsider the question of providing assistance for former employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33754/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The State has already made a significant financial contribution to assist the former employees of Irish Fertiliser Industries. Following the decision by the board of IFI to put the company into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, while there was no legal obligation to do so, established a special fund with almost &euro;24.5 million to provide<i> ex-gratia </i>severance payments to the former employees of IFI. All applications from employees to the <i>ex-gratia</i> fund of &euro;24.5 million, have now been processed. Payments from the fund were made in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund, which has been endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.</P>
        <P>In addition, the liquidator has, based on legal advice received, admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements in respect of the voluntary severance terms traditionally paid by the company. However, the dividend payable to the workers concerned, if any, can only be determined when all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. In addition, the arrangements for the<i> ex-gratia</i> fund of &euro;24.5 million provided by the shareholders provide that any such dividends would be reduced by the amounts received from the fund. It must be emphasised, of course, that the amount to be paid in due course in respect of such claims, if anything is a matter solely for determination by the liquidator.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, I am aware that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardson&rsquo;s pension fund, are likely to receive much reduced pension entitlements. The specific financial position of the Richardson&rsquo;s fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.</P>
        <P>I understand that the UK government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of <Col N="1030"/>pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme. In addition, I understand that the trustees of the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme have submitted a claim to the liquidator of IFI and that he is currently considering, in consultation with his legal and actuarial advisers, whether, and to what extent, this claim is admissible.</P>
        <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall which the pension scheme faces.</P>

	<P>The Government and the State development agencies are committed to ensuring balanced regional development, particularly through the implementation of the national spatial strategy and the decentralisation programme. The agencies are committed to playing their part in the development of the north west by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs and by attracting new investment into the region.</P>
        <P>Employment in the region has been dependent on traditional low-end manufacturing sectors such as clothing and textiles. The transition to a high skill, high technology regional economy will take time to achieve and unfortunately at present the rate of jobs creation has been unable to keep pace with these job losses. In County Donegal, employment in overseas firms has fallen to 2,287 due mainly to the loss of jobs in the clothing and textile sector in companies such as Fruit of the Loom and Unifi.</P>
        <P>The development agencies under my remit, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county development boards, are committed to the economic development of the region. As far as IDA Ireland is concerned, the north west region continues to be a priority location. A fundamental part of the agency&rsquo;s policy is the delivery of new greenfield jobs into the Objective one region, including the north west. In recent years, IDA has been able to attract new investment in emerging sectors such as international services, life sciences, including medical technologies, software and high-end engineering. Companies like Abbot Laboratories, MBNA, Eaton Corporation and PacifiCare have made huge investments in the region. There were 459 new jobs created in IDA supported companies in the north west region in 2002 and 818 in 2003. Figures for 2004 are not yet available. In addition, IDA Ireland is working with Invest Northern Ireland on a cross-Border basis on a virtual cross-Border park, which will <Col N="1031"/>involve joint marketing efforts and planned improved telecoms infrastructure. The agency continues to develop its property portfolio in the region to international standards.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in setting up high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>Direct funding amounting to &euro;6 million was approved for companies in the north west region in 2002 and 2003 and around &euro;2.5 million has been approved to date in 2004. This support enables companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development. Furthermore, under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness fund, set up to help small and medium sized enterprises overcome distinctive difficulties, over &euro;1.6 million has been approved for ten companies in the region. As part of its role in regional development Enterprise Ireland seeks to improve the business climate for its clients and to support the provision of enterprise space. Enterprise Ireland-funded infrastructural projects in the north west region include 24 community enterprise centres, and incubation facilities at Sligo IT and Letterkenny IT.</P>
        <P>The county enterprise boards in Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim continue to work actively with local people to set up, grow and develop micro-enterprises. The boards, whose work results in dispersed economic development throughout the region, provide a comprehensive system of capital and employment grants, support, mentoring, and training and development initiatives for new and existing micro-enterprises.</P>
        <P>From 2002 to date the Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim boards have approved a total of over &euro;3.6 million to 252 projects in the north west region which, in turn, has assisted in the creation of 338 jobs in the area. I am confident that the strategies being pursued by these agencies will result in continued growth and development in the north west.</P>

	<P>On 2 December I visited Donegal and met a number of groups and companies. These included Buncrana Town Council, Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce, SIPTU, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny IT, WESTBIC, Powerbar, Clubman Omega and Ashley Martin. I undertook this visit in recognition of the relatively difficult employment situation in Donegal, although it also has to be recognised that the number of persons on the live register has been decreasing in Donegal over the last number of years.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its client companies in the county to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation so that they can compete globally. Direct support amounting to &euro;15 million has been approved for client companies in the north west region since January 2000, of which approximately &euro;10 million is for companies in County Donegal. To date in 2004, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding for over &euro;1.5 million and also paid over &euro;1.5 million to companies in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>The IDA is actively marketing all areas of Donegal for new investment and jobs and has invested significant moneys in developing a business park to international standards in Letterkenny. Companies locating in this park will be recruiting from the wider Donegal area. This is in line with the national spatial strategy and the designation of Letterkenny as a gateway location.</P>
        <P>The Donegal County Enterprise Board continues to be active in helping new and existing micro-enterprises in the county. To date the board has approved a total of &euro;645,470 in funding to 26 projects that will assist in the creation of 66 net new jobs for the region.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S is also particularly important in providing training and upskilling for workers who have lost their jobs at Unifi and for those currently employed at Fruit of the Loom. F&Aacute;S offers two fully equipped training centres in <Col N="1033"/>Donegal, the only county outside of Dublin that is so serviced. Both of these centres are operating to the highest international standards.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy, as I did the groups I met in Donegal, that tackling the difficulties in Donegal is a priority for the Government and myself and I have also reiterated this to the state development agencies operating in Donegal.</P>

	<P>Training and employment services for people with a disability were restructured in June 2000 as part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of mainstreaming services to people with disabilities. The objective of the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy is to provide services to people with disabilities in a more integrated way, offering more choice and options than was previously available. This approach is in accordance with the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was published in 1996.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy responsibility for providing vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Responsibility for rehabilitative training, that is, personal development and basic life skills, and sheltered workshops remains with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policies in this area are being developed through a three dimensional approach: developing the skills of people with disabilities for employment; stimulating awareness among employers of the contribution which people with disabilities can make to their businesses; and providing a range of employment supports for people with disabilities and employers.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of F&Aacute;S training programmes and services and F&Aacute;S also provides an extensive range of schemes and grants to promote employment of people with disabilities in the private sector.</P>
        <P>I was recently pleased to announce that &euro;5 million is being provided to F&Aacute;S in 2005 to launch a new employment support scheme for people with disabilities. This funding will allow the introduction of a new full-time support scheme on a three year pilot basis, aimed at increasing the numbers <Col N="1034"/>of people with disabilities in full time employment in the open labour market.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s objective in the period ahead is to consolidate the significant value added in advancing the employment and training agenda since assuming policy responsibility for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities.</P>

	<P>Following the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, which now regulates and supervises insurance undertakings and the completion by my Department of all tasks relevant to it in the insurance reform programme, the Minister for Transport has taken over the lead role in relation to policy and legislation on the availability and cost of motor insurance and any related inter-departmental co-ordination. Posts have recently transferred from my Department to give effect to this change.</P>
        <P>It will, therefore, be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport to take forward the co-ordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the issues raised in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report 2004 and previous MIAB reports and to consider what further action may now be necessary on foot of this report.</P>
        <P>The primary ongoing insurance focus of my Department will be from the horizontal competitiveness perspective and competition in conjunction with the Competition Authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 38 together.</P>
        <P>Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the DPP. The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company. Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>In relation to the three remaining section 19 investigations, the authorised officer was directed by my predecessor to cease investigative work and to commence writing up his reports with a view to facilitating appropriate follow-up action as soon as possible by the relevant authorities. My Department is currently in consultation with the authorised officer regarding the timetable for completion of his work on these investigations.</P>
        <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately &euro;10.9 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the &euro;10.9 million expended, &euro;1.6 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining <Col N="1036"/>&euro;9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8; &euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
        <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State.</P>
        <P>In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the Court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. The costs of the investigation have been borne by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I understand that Department has requested the Chief State Solicitors Office to commence the process of recovering the full costs of the investigations from the Bank.</P>
        <P>Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>

	<P>The current position in relation to the transposition of EU directives for which my Department is responsible indicates a total of 31 directives to be implemented, including nine for which the deadline for implementation, in full or in part, has passed.</P>
        <P>Details of the directives, including, in so far as it has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.entemp.ie/trade/eudirectives/<?oasys _jy?>index.htm. </i>The website also contains information on directives currently awaiting transposition in respect of which infringement proceedings have been commenced. A reasoned opinion, under Article 226 of the treaty, has been issued by the Commission in respect of one directive for which the transposition deadline has passed. It is anticipated that regulations will shortly be made transposing the remaining provisions of this directive.</P><Col N="1037"/>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if he has commissioned or carried out studies on the effects of the rising age profiles on regulations governing employment and, in particular, on regulations governing retirement; and if he will report on the conclusions of these studies.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not commissioned or carried out any studies on the effects of the rising age profiles of persons in employment. Policy in the pensions area is determined by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Flexibility and security in the labour market, as well as work organisation and work-life balance requirements can be facilitated through atypical work patterns such as part-time and fixed-term contract work. Such work patterns and systems have, in recent years, encouraged many older workers in particular, to either join or re-enter the Irish labour market and I welcome this positive development.</P>
        <P>Employment rights legislation protects employees against arbitrary or capricious behaviour by employers and helps to foster labour market harmony by promoting personnel policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. Recent developments in the area of employment rights of particular interest to older workers include: legislation protecting part-time employees from discrimination in relation to conditions of employment, including pay and pensions, under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001; legislation protecting employees on fixed-term contracts from discrimination in relation to conditions of employment, including pay and pensions, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; amendment of the Unfair Dismissals Acts to provide that a person who is over the age of 66 years is no longer excluded from those Acts unless he or she had already reached the normal retirement age for employees of the same employer in similar employment; the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 which was signed into law on 25 March 2004. The Act &mdash; which is administered by the Department of Finance &mdash; covers new entrants who become public servants on or after 1 April 2004. The Act does not affect the current terms of existing public service <Col N="1038"/>employees. The Act removes the compulsory retirement age for new entrants to the public service, with the exception of certain posts in the Permanent Defence Force, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service and the Fire Service.</P>
        <P>Except as outlined above, there is nothing to prevent an employee requesting his or her employer to be retained in employment beyond the age of 65 years. Such workers could continue to work on a full-time or part-time basis and can get an old age contributory pension from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>Companies in Ireland are free to establish and organise themselves in the most suitable form to promote and run their businesses, provided that they comply fully with relevant national and EU legislation. Multi-national companies including companies that have Irish subsidiaries are required to file annual returns with audited accounts with the Registrar of Companies. Many multi-national companies file their accounts in compliance with the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, which cover the financial affairs of the parent undertaking and the subsidiary undertaking as a whole. It is not clear to me that there is a real problem in this area and I therefore, have no proposals to introduce legislation on the lines suggested.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In the past few years, conditions in the global economy have been difficult, and Irish firms have had to win business against a backdrop of difficult external demand conditions, pricing pressures, and an increasingly competitive international environment. These have affected employment trends in companies assisted by the enterprise development agencies. However, employment in these companies is still one third higher than it was a decade ago. This is a strong performance in the context of global economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>There are now indications that economic prospects are improving and our propensity to capitalise on trends in global growth is likely to again stimulate business expansion and real employment growth. The ESRI has indicated that industrial employment will increase by 0.6% this year and by 1% in 2005, supported by significant growth in GNP. In light of the intense global competitive pressures on manufacturing, these forecasts show that our economy maintains considerable strengths.</P>
        <P>More generally, the labour market is robust and unemployment is continuing to fall. The latest quarterly national household survey figures released by the Central Statistics Office show that the total at work increased by 57,200 year on year in the third quarter of 2004. This represents an increase of 3.1% in employment, which is the highest level of annual growth recorded since the first quarter of 2001. The data further shows that employment growth was spread across all regions.</P>
        <P>As the following table indicates, the number in employment across the economy ihas ncreased by <Col N="1040"/>almost 165,000 over the five-year period from 2000 to 2004.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>The studies by the Competition Authority into the banking, insurance and professional services markets are progressing. The authority published its final report on competition in the engineering profession on 1 December 2004 and concluded that the current regulatory regime in that profession essentially facilitates competition. I expect to receive the final report in relation to architects by March 2005.</P>
        <P>The studies of other professions across the medical, legal and construction sectors are ongoing and the reports will be released during 2005. In relation to veterinary surgeons, I understand that a consultation paper and initial recommendations will be published in the first quarter of 2005 and the final report in the second half of the year.</P>
        <P>The authority&rsquo;s initial recommendations and consultation paper in respect of the two legal professions &mdash; solicitors and barristers &mdash; will be published in January and the final report and recommendations will be published later in 2005. Initial <Col N="1041"/>recommendations and consultation papers in respect of each of the three remaining medical professions will be published in the second half of 2005.</P>
        <P>The authority published a report on the banking sector, prepared in conjunction with economic consultants LECG, on Tuesday last, 14 December 2004. It contains a comprehensive analysis of two key markets &mdash; personal current accounts and loans to small and medium sized enterprises. The report makes 40 recommendations aimed at enhancing competition between banks for the benefit of both personal banking customers and small and medium enterprises. The authority has now invited interested parties to submit comments on the remedies to the competition issues outlined in the report by 14 February 2005 after which it will publish a final report and recommendations.</P>
        <P>The authority, in conjunction with my Department, has also conducted a study of competition issues in the non-life insurance market. Research on barriers to entry and rivalry in motor, employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance has been carried out and an initial report containing preliminary results of the research was published in February 2004. The authority has completed a consultation exercise with interested parties and is concluding its final report which will be published in January 2005.</P>
        <P>The authority has advised me that the studies have taken longer to complete than anticipated due to a number of factors, not least the extensive consultation process involved. Progress on the professions study in particular has also been hampered by the need to divert resources to deal the high level of merger activity. However, I am currently arranging to provide the authority with additional resources for processing merger notifications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The information available to my Department is that Irish Ferries account for an estimated 25% of the total roll-on roll-off capacity available on cross channel routes. This does not include other modes of transport such as air transport. At present, Irish indigenous companies appear to be switching to alternative ferry services on the remaining 75% capacity available, and availing of ferry services from ports in Northern Ireland to meet their exporting needs. Air freight services are also being used as an alternative, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>The situation with regard to foreign multinational companies based in Ireland is that these companies usually produce goods with high value-to-weight ratios, which are typically exported by air. In addition, an increasing proportion of trade by multinational companies is in services, which are &ldquo;exported&rdquo; in digital format or by using global telecommunications links; and also these companies often use international couriers or specialist freight forwarding companies to transport their output.</P>
        <P>At this stage of the dispute, therefore, there appears to be no major disruption to exports on the part of Irish companies in the internationally traded sector. However, I am acutely aware that the longer the dispute remains unresolved, the greater the potential adverse impact on Irish exporters. I can assure the Deputy that I will, therefore, be keeping the situation under close observation during the coming weeks. In the meantime, any companies experiencing difficulties can contact Enterprise Ireland for advice.</P>

	<P>As the House will be aware from previous similar parliamentary questions, there have been a number of developments that will impact on the mid-west region and the roles of the respective State agencies operating there, the most significant of which are: the proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, involving 300 of the agency&rsquo;s Dublin based staff to Shannon, as part of the Government decentralisation programme; the decision to establish an independent Shannon Airport Authority, and the enterprise strategy group which reported in July has recommended that Shannon Development should disengage from industrial development functions which should be left to the national agencies, that is, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</P>
        <P>Other developments such as the removal of the need for operating licences for companies setting up in the Shannon free zone, the transfer of responsibility for Shannon town from Shannon Development to Clare County Council and the proposed uniting of County Kerry for tourism development purposes will also impact on the future role of Shannon Development, in particular. It is worth repeating that Shannon Development fully supports the decision to establish an independent airport authority which they see as vital to the economic development of the region. They further agree that the company should refocus its activities on the airport with a view to generating business for the airport and the company&rsquo;s assets should be used to support the airport authority particularly in its early, vulnerable years. A working group was set up by my predecessor to examine the specific issue of how Shannon Development could best contribute to the development of the new independent airport. It has carried out some detailed work in relation to the various options available but its work is not yet completed. I have reviewed the deliberations of the group and am now actively pursuing the matter through consultations with relevant Cabinet colleagues.</P>
        <P>My schedule has not permitted a meeting with the Shannon Development Board to date but I expect that such a meeting will take place shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 125 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of media reports of consumers shopping north of the Border as a result of price differences between here and Northern Ireland. Retail prices are determined by a variety of factors including supplier and other input costs incurred by the retailer. Prices can also be determined by market forces and will often be a reflection of what the market will bear.</P>
        <P>Price comparisons with Northern Ireland will also be dependant on currency fluctuations and a strong euro will have the effect of prices in that jurisdiction appearing significantly cheaper than at times when the exchange rate is less favourable.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s statement on prices and costs, 2004 which confirmed that many goods and services have become more expensive in Ireland than in many other EU member states. It may be that the publication of this sort of information during the year has made consumers more aware of price differentials. If so, I welcome the fact that Irish consumers are becoming more price sensitive, I welcome the fact that competitive forces are at work in the economy and I welcome cross-border competition. It is good that consumers have this sort of information available to them in order to make these choices.</P>
        <P>However, my concern is to ensure that our economy remains competitive not least in terms of value for money for our consumers. That is why the Government earlier this year established the consumer strategy group to advise and make recommendations for the development of a national consumer policy. In the performance of this role the consumer strategy group has carried out a range of activities, including studies that investigate issues of special concern. Price trends with other parts of Europe have been examined and some prices have been the subject of additional investigation, including those of fruit and vegetables, alcoholic beverages, and pharmaceuticals. The group will report to me early in the new year and I plan to give the report prompt attention and consideration as soon as I receive it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of redundancies notified to my Department in the years specified were 13,316 in 2000, 19,977 in 2001, 25,358 in 2002, 27,702 in 2003 and 22,080 to the end of November 2004. The corresponding figure to the end of November 2003 was 24,840 which means a decrease of over 11% in the number of redundancies notified to my Department so far this year. It is not possible to project what the total number of redundancies will be for the year. However, if a similar decrease were to be maintained for the remainder of the year, the total number of redundancies in 2004 would be approximately 24,600, which would be over 3,000 down on last year.</P>
        <P>The most recent quarterly national household survey released by the Central Statistics Office on 7 December 2004 shows that employment growth continued in the third quarter of 2004 with an increase of 57,200 or 3.1 % in the year. This is the highest level of annual growth recorded since the 3.8% recorded in the first quarter of 2001. The total number of persons in employment is 1.89 million. In addition, the Central Bank is forecasting growth of 4.5% in gross national product for 2004, which also indicates a positive outlook for the economy in general.</P>
        <P>The development of a competitive economy is a central tenet of generating sustainable employment and growth and is the focus of this Government&rsquo;s policies. Initiatives by the Government and the State development agencies, including reducing the burden of unnecessary regulation, are aimed at helping the country progress towards a knowledge and innovation-driven economy. Ongoing six monthly assessments of our competitive position will ensure that appropriate and timely actions are taken to address identified weaknesses.</P>

However, according to the latest quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 7 December 2004, the number of unemployed persons in the Border area for the quarter to August 2004 was 12,200. This figure represents an unemployment rate of 5.9% an improvement on the August, 2003 rate of 6.3%.</P>
        <P>The Donegal live register rate decreased by 8.41% between November 2003 and November 2004, down from 9,923 to 9,088. Although the live register is not a true record of the level of unemployment, as it includes people who are not available for work, it is a useful indicator of current employment trends. These statistics indicate that the actions being taken by the industrial development agencies are impacting positively on Donegal and the Border region in general.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I led a trade mission to Korea and Japan from 14 to 20 November last. Some 26 companies participated in the mission to Korea, and 40 in the mission to Japan. This was the first ministerial trade mission to Korea organised by Enterprise Ireland, and the first to Japan since 2001. The missions included representatives of a variety of sectors, although the education, primarily third level, and high-tech sectors were strongly represented.</P>
        <P>As always, the main purpose of the mission was to support Irish companies exporting or investigating the opportunities in Korea and Japan, and to raise the profile of Ireland as a supplier of high-quality goods and services; the latter is particularly important in a region where Ireland is still relatively little-known. I also had the pleasure of viewing the newly-opened Enterprise Ireland offices in Seoul during the mission.</P>
        <P>In Korea, as well as meeting the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, I addressed the higher education seminar organised in conjunction with the mission. I also met representatives of leading Korean corporations in the ICT and aviation fields, as well as leading academics.</P>
        <P>I witnessed the exchange of a memorandum of understanding between Enterprise Ireland and the Korean Games Development Institute, which offers significant potential to develop co-operation between Irish and Korean companies in this sector. I also met the chairman of the Korean Software Association to discuss further co-operation in the software sector.</P>
        <P>As a result of the mission, 15 articles appeared in the Korean media. This gave an important boost to Ireland&rsquo;s profile in Korea, where it is still relatively low. A further 11 articles appeared in Irish media, helping to encourage Irish companies to think about the possibilities offered by this market.</P>
        <P>Japan is a more developed market for Ireland, which explains the larger number of companies which participated in this leg of the mission. However, we still need to raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile in Japan, and the nine news articles which appeared in Japan as a result of this mission will have helped in this regard. A further 13 articles which appeared in the Irish media will also have helped to encourage Irish companies to think about the Japanese market.</P>
        <P>In Japan, I met senior Vice Minister Okonagi in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and opened a similar education seminar to that held in Korea. I was also pleased to have witnessed <Col N="1048"/>announcements by four Irish companies of major business developments in Japan and the establishment of new partnerships with Japanese companies. In addition, I presented special awards to three Japanese companies which have made significant contributions to Irish-Japanese trade. It is still too soon to give information about any specific results of the mission, but I am very confident that it was of strong assistance in raising Ireland&rsquo;s profile in both Korea and Japan, as well as offering encouragement to Irish companies to examine the potential in both markets. I plan to ask Enterprise Ireland, the organisers of the mission, to provide more information in relation to the mission outcomes after a suitable period has elapsed.</P>

	<P>The work of the consumer strategy group is ongoing and has involved a number of initiatives. The website <i>www.irishconsumer.ie </i>has been established. A public consultation on consumer issues was held and individual consumers, representative organisations, businesses and any other interested parties were invited to contact the group with views and submissions by 9 July. The group produced a consultation paper entitled Components of Consumer Policy intended to assist those wishing to make a submission and to provide a framework for its work. In this paper the group focused on the key principles guiding the consumer agenda &mdash; access, safeguards, advice and support, redress, and consumer power, and also examined questions related to the business sector and consumers.</P>
        <P>The group is conducting detailed research in a number of fields relevant to its work, including consumer attitudes, issues related to the retail sector, transport, the planning process, and a number of other issues. The experience of other countries in implementing consumer policy is also being taken into account. The group has met with various parties, including officials of my own Department, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Competition Authority and IFSRA. Numerous other meetings have been held with other relevant bodies in connection with the detailed work of the group. The group is due to produce a final report to me in the new year.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the introduction of the book of quantum by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in June 2004 has led in general to increased compensation awards; if this was intended policy; and his views on whether the downward trend in insurance premia prior to the establishment of the PIAB may be reversed as a consequence.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In producing the book of quantum it was not intended policy to either reduce or increase personal injury compensation levels but merely to reflect, in a guide, what the current level of damages is for particular types of injuries. The book of quantum was compiled by an external independent expert company using data sourced from courts, the Irish Insurance Federation and the State Claims Agency. The book is a guide to a range of compensation levels for particular types of injuries and reflects existing levels of awards in this country. The book contains clear guidelines as to the interpretation of its contents. Operational matters relating to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, are a matter for the CEO of PIAB. However, to date I believe PIAB has not made any awards, I have no statistical evidence of any changes in compensation awards in this country since the introduction of PIAB and therefore cannot comment on any potential impact on insurance premia.</P>
        <P>The book of quantum is one element of a whole raft of measures contained in the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme, which have contributed to downward pressure on premia. All the measures are expected to lead towards further reductions as their effects continue to impact. These other measures include reform of the law on personal injury, improvement in road safety measures, public information, promotion of competition, transparency and consumer protection.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 71, 72 and 131 together.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S employment programmes, which comprise community employment, social economy and job initiative, are being maintained at their existing level in 2005 at 25,000 places. Community employment provides work experience and training opportunities for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups with the aim of <Col N="1051"/>assisting participants to progress to a job in the open labour market. The programme specifically caters for persons with a wide range of disabilities who satisfy the eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P>I am informed by F&Aacute;S that the number of participants on community employment in January, 2003 was 24,991 of which 4,098 or 17.7% were persons with disabilities; in January 2004 there were 19,848 persons on the programme of which 3,401 or 18.6% were persons with disabilities; it is anticipated that there will be 21,650 participants on community employment at the start of 2005 and approximately 20% will be persons with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I have reviewed current policy on the operation of the F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which had been the subject by F&Aacute;S of an assessment earlier this year. On foot of this review I decided that with effect from 10 November 2004 the three year cap would be removed for community employment participants aged 55 or over. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on community employment for a maximum of six years. The current ring-fencing and prioritisation for the essential services of child care health related services and drugs task force clients are being maintained. The continuance of ringfencing and the extended participation on community employment by older workers will help to secure the continuity of community services generally and will ensure that the existing community service support framework will be maintained. I have no plans to make any further changes to community employment criteria in the immediate future. The community employment programme will, of course, continue to be monitored closely by this Department.</P>

        <P>The purpose of the draft regulations is to prescribe the main requirements for the protection of the safety, health and welfare of persons working on construction sites and to give further effect to the Council Directive 92/57/EEC by replacing the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001, S.I.

	<P>It is important to put into context Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance compared with the performances of our EU partners. Our projected economic growth of 5.1% of GDP in 2005 will be more than twice the EU average, while our unemployment rate at 4.4% is half the EU average. Ireland also has one of the lowest debt burdens in the EU and yet our rate of public investment at nearly 5% of GNP is almost twice the EU average. In a European context, Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance is exceptional and has demonstrated resilience. We realise, however, <Col N="1053"/>that our prosperity is not a stable asset and underpinning economic competitiveness remains critical to our future well-being.</P>
        <P>To ensure our continued economic success the Government is committed to enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its annual competitiveness report provides valuable analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness status including identifying challenges to our economic performance. The NCC also recommends policy responses to meet these challenges. These recommendations are considered by Government and the relevant Departments each year. The most recent NCC annual reports were published on 14 October 2004. An interdepartmental group chaired by my Department, is considering the recommendations and will report to Government on progress early next year.</P>
        <P>In the recent budget the Government has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring Ireland remains competitive. Examples of this commitment include the guarantee to maintain high levels of investment in infrastructure over the next five years. The Government also reiterated its commitment to an equitable tax system that rewards work and reduces the burden on the lower paid in our society. By not increasing the main VAT and excise rates in the budget, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that the progress made on reducing consumer price inflation during 2004 continues into next year.</P>
        <P>The research agenda is one of the most important elements in terms of our drive to increase both competitiveness and quality employment now and in the future. A group involving representatives from industry, venture capitalists, the universities and institutes of technology, Departments and agencies has developed Ireland&rsquo;s research and development action plan under the aegis of my Department. The plan was published in August 2004. It sets a target of spend on research and development of 2.5% of GNP by 2010 and makes a range of high level recommendations in pursuit of this. These recommendations are ambitious, but represent the kind of actions Ireland needs to take, if it is to continue to be competitive in a fast-changing globalised economy.</P>
        <P>The enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s, ESG, report, Ahead of the Curve, is pivotal in road mapping the future direction of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy and ensuring our competitiveness in the future. The purpose of the ESG is to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise sector is able to build on its strengths and is able to exploit new opportunities that will arise in the future. The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations contained in this report. The implementation process is currently being finalised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the past 12 months my Department, through Forf&aacute;s, commissioned a review of the role and functions of the CEBs in the development of micro-enterprises. Fitzpatricks Associates conducted this review and it involved consultations with all relevant interested parties. The review represents the most comprehensive examination of the role and functions of the CEBs since their inception over ten years ago. The review was considered appropriate against the background of the major economic changes that have taken place in Ireland over that period.</P>
        <P>The review largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs. It concluded that there is justification for continued State support to micro-enterprises and that the CEB network can continue to play a useful role in the overall national enterprise development policy. The review recommended that in providing assistance to micro-enterprises CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that the issues of potential dead-weight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed and that there should be a move away from grants to repayable finance as well as to soft supports.</P>
        <P>As funding for the CEBs is provided by the Exchequer, through the National Development Plan 2000-2006, support for the development of micro-enterprise as offered by the CEBs must operate within the parameters laid down in the relevant operational programmes of the national development plan, NDP.</P>
        <P>The current NDP specifically states that there will be a progressive shift, over the lifetime of this NDP, from providing direct financial assistance to other non-financial supports such as advice, mentoring, and management development. As a result, where finance is provided, this is increasingly in the form of equity and refundable grants. In addition, the CEBs will continue to give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, which over time may develop into strong export entities.</P>
        <P>In determining the allocations for individual city and county enterprise boards, CEBs, this year, my Department adopted a systematic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment. This <Col N="1055"/>approach involved the provision of a basic allocation to each board as well as an additional allocation that was determined mainly by population but which also took account of issues such as unemployment, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread. My Department recently reviewed the level of funding available to the CEBs for the current year with a view to identifying funds which individual boards were not in a position to spend this year and to reallocating such funds to other boards who were in a position to utilise additional funding.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of efficiency my Department, in partnership with the CEBs, continually monitors and evaluates the level of service provided by the boards to their client base. There is both a formal procedures manual and operating agreement in place between the Department and the boards to ensure that the efficient delivery of services by all CEBs is standardised across the country.</P>

	<P>I understand that a claim was lodged by a trade union representing employees of the company referred to by the Deputy with the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004, S.I. No. 76 of 2004, but that no progress was made in resolving the union&rsquo;s claim. I understand further that the trade union then lodged a claim with the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, and the Labour Court has begun a preliminary hearing, which is scheduled to continue next week.</P>
        <P>This legislation and the code of practice stem from the recommendations of a high level group comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU, and various Government Departments and agencies and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which was established under Partnership 2000 to consider proposals submitted by ICTU on the recognition of unions and the right to bargain.</P><Col N="1056"/>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>In line with the voluntarist nature of the system of industrial relations in Ireland, this group recommended that two distinct procedures be put in place for the resolution of disputes where negotiation arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not exist &mdash; a voluntary procedure and a legislative fall-back procedure. These recommendations were implemented through the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000, S.I. No. 145 of 2000, and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. During the negotiations between the Government and the social partners on the partnership programme Sustaining Progress, the need to enhance the effectiveness of these procedures was agreed.</P>
        <P>A number of measures which have resulted in significant improvements to the procedures were put in place earlier this year by means of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004, S.I. No. 76 of 2004, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004, S.I. No. 139 of 2004, and the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. These measures include the introduction of timescales to the process of dispute resolution in situations where it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations in respect of a particular grade or group of employees. I have no plans to bring forward further legislation in this matter.</P>

	<P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is structured in a way which recognises that enterprise and employment are complementary rather than competing factors. Calls for alternative configurations, such as that advocated by the president of SIPTU, appear to stem from a flawed concept that places jobs and welfare at work in competition with enterprise. The Government has a different and more positive view &mdash; one that seeks to grow the quality and number of jobs by growing trade and enterprise.</P>
        <P>Only by growing our competitiveness, increasing our trade performance and expanding <Col N="1057"/>enterprise performance can we produce sustainable high quality jobs. Similarly, only by ensuring that we have a well-trained and confident workforce, which enjoys the protection of our health and safety and employment rights legislation, can enterprise flourish.</P>
        <P>Since 1993, when the Department was established in its current formation, we have seen jobs and real wages growing at unprecedented levels. We have introduced the national minimum wage and seen a significant improvement in the legislative framework protecting workers. The welfare of workers, especially those most exposed to low incomes, has been transformed during this period. This has also helped sustain, and be sustained by, a parallel and unprecedented improvement in trade and enterprise performance. This is incontrovertible evidence that our pro-enterprise and pro-jobs policies have made a real difference.</P>
        <P>While the factors supporting this transformation are manifold and social partnership clearly played its part, it is clear that the current configuration of my Department is right for Ireland and this was affirmed by Government following the last election. I am therefore, strongly opposed to any attempts to change this successful structure.</P>

In opting to exempt all Irish libraries, account was taken of the small Irish lending pool, and of the likely small-scale benefit of a public lending right for authors compared with the costs of collection which would arise. The modest benefits of such a measure to authors was also considered in the context of national cultural policy and of our long-standing efforts to make information available to the public. It was for these reasons that Ireland, in its transposition of the directive, effectively exempted all public libraries from liability.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, we became aware that the Commission disagreed with our approach in this matter. A letter was therefore issued by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce to the then Internal Market Commissioner, Mr. Frits Bolkestein on 2 June 2004, in anticipation of a reasoned opinion on the subject. That correspondence indicated that the Department would now consult other Departments that would necessarily be involved in the development of such right but that no final decision had been taken in regard to the introduction of a scheme.</P>
        <P>In the event, the Commission issued its reasoned opinion on 7 July on the grounds of insufficient assurances of Irish willingness to respond to its concerns in the matter. In light of the correspondence referred to and other related correspondence, the Commission was fully aware of Ireland&rsquo;s position in respect of the issues set out in its reasoned opinion.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, my Department has been consulting the main Departments involved and, following a further wider round of consultations, aims to frame proposals for a workable scheme of public lending rights in the near future. Proposals for legislative changes to give effect to such a scheme would also be required. The development of those proposals will take full account of the Commission&rsquo;s position regarding Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the terms of the directive. In the meantime, my Department is in continuing informal contact with the European Commission about the matter.</P>

        <P>In considering this matter I have had to examine whether a price display order for doctors and dentists could be effectively enforced. My considered view is that it would not be possible to enforce the present proposal and that consequently it would not be appropriate for me to make such an order.</P>

	<P>In its most recent report the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, included recommendations on maintaining a competitive taxation system while financing public investment. The NCC highlighted the importance of ongoing improvements to physical infrastructure as a critical factor in our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that economic competitiveness remains critical to our future well-being and this was pivotal in forming the recent budget. In budget 2005, the Government has committed itself to maintaining its high level <Col N="1060"/>of investment in infrastructure through the multi-annual capital envelopes, committing &euro;36.3 billion over the next five years. This is almost twice the European average. The need for value for money for capital expenditure was also highlighted in the budget. The Department of Finance is due shortly to publish revised guidelines concerning the appraisal and management of capital projects. The budget also reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a taxation system that is designed to expand our economy, reward work and alleviate the tax burden for the lower paid. The Government also increased tax relief on certain third level fees, thereby increasing the affordability of higher education and promoting upskilling and lifelong learning among our workforce. All these areas were identified by the NCC in their 2004 report.</P>
        <P>The NCC made a number of other recommendations in the areas of entrepreneurship, enterprise development, innovation and creativity. These and other recommendations are being considered by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by my Department. This interdepartmental group will prepare a report to Government on the recommendation early next year.</P>

	<P>On foot of an undertaking in An Agreed Programme for Government to &ldquo;review the functions of the Employment Rights Bodies&rdquo;, a review group was established in September 2003, to examine the coherence and user-friendliness of procedures operating in the area of employment rights compliance.</P>
        <P>Membership of the review group consisted of personnel from the bodies covered by the review and representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Written submissions were received from various parties, including the social partners and the bodies covered by the review.</P>
        <P>The review group found that while the current employment rights adjudication and enforcement system has served employers, workers and their representatives well over the years, it is a system that has now become overly complex and is considered to be working in a less than optimal fashion. The review group has proposed some changes in both the configuration and remit of <Col N="1061"/>the bodies concerned, together with a suggested programme of administrative and procedural reform.</P>
        <P>Before formulating definitive proposals in this area I have recently requested that some further consultation be undertaken in relation to the report and its recommendations with the employment rights bodies concerned and the social partners. This exercise, which I expect to be completed before the end of the year, does not seek to replicate the work of the review group but will build on it. I expect to be in a position to indicate the way forward early in the new year and I would then expect to make the report available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Law Reform Commission in its consultation paper on corporate killing of October 2003 recommended that a new offence of corporate killing be established which would be prosecuted on indictment, without exclusion of any entity whether incorporated or not. The offence would apply to acts or omissions of a high managerial agent, which would be treated as those of the undertaking.</P>
        <P>To reflect the seriousness of the offence, the commission also recommended that the legislation should provide for an unlimited fine, or that in certain circumstances, an individual high managerial agent should also be subject to imprisonment of up to five years. The commission is currently considering submissions on its consultation paper. My Department is already in receipt of advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the issue of corporate killing has broad implications.</P>
        <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, which took place on 23 and 24 November last, Government policy is to await the review by the Law Reform Commission and to then decide what is to be done with regard to the issue of corporate manslaughter. The provisions in section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004 entitled &ldquo;Liability of directors and officers of undertakings&rdquo; are more explicit in relation to the assignment of responsibility than an existing provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. However it is worth noting that directors and managers of companies have in the past been prosecuted for failures <Col N="1062"/>under occupational safety law which resulted in death or serious injury to workers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to introduce penalties and fines for employers who delay payment of awards. There is a right of redress for employees under existing legislation. Employment rights legislation provides for action that may be taken where an employer fails to pay the award, or appeals the determination or decision to the Circuit Court or as appropriate to the District Court. It provides that where an employer fails to carry out the terms of a determination or a decision of the Labour Court within six weeks of the date on which the determination or decision is communicated to the parties concerned, the Circuit Court or, where appropriate, the District Court, shall on application to it in that behalf by the employee concerned, or with the consent of the employee, any trade union of which the employee is a member, or the Minister, if the Minister considers it appropriate to make the application having regard to all the circumstances make an order directing the employer to carry out the determination or decision in accordance with its terms.</P>
        <P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 1993, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provide that the Circuit Court may, in an order, having regard to all the circumstances, where the order relates to the payment of compensation, direct the employer to pay the employee concerned interest on the compensation at the rate referred to in the Courts Act 1981. There is a similar provision in the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994, which allows the District Court to direct the employer to pay the employee concerned interest on the compensation.</P>

	<P>In reply to a question on the provision of legal protection for whistleblowers I informed the House, in my reply of 16 November 2004, that the provision of statutory protection on a sectoral basis would provide a better and more focused <Col N="1063"/>approach to dealing with the issue. A provision has been included in that regard in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, currently before this House, which provides for protection against dismissal and penalisation of employees who, in good faith, take steps to protect themselves or others in a workplace situation.</P>

        <P>An agreement is in place between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, which sets out the supply terms and prices of medicines supplied to the health services. The agreement covers all reimbursable prescription medicines in the general medical services and community drug schemes and all medicines supplied to hospitals and health boards. The current agreement expires in mid-<Col N="1064"/>2005 and the Department will shortly be entering into negotiation with IPHA-APMI.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that clinical decisions in relation to prescribing are taken by a general practitioner or consultant based on the symptoms of the presenting patient. A pharmacist may only vary a prescription in exceptional circumstances. There are no incentives to dispense or prescribe expensive medicines but there is a system in place to encourage rational prescribing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 1970, a health board may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme, LTI. The conditions are: mental handicap; mental illness, for people under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism; conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.</P>
        <P>Prior to 1971, there was inadequate provision for assistance to people with large ongoing medical expenses. The purpose of the LTI scheme was to protect patients with a specified condition from excessive drug costs, by providing free drugs and medicines to treat that condition only. Following the establishment of the GMS scheme in 1971, to provide free treatment for those who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange to provide it for themselves and their dependants, various co-payment schemes have been introduced to provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for non-medical card holders with significant ongoing medical expenses, without restriction to the treatment of a particular condition. Since 1999, non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI have been able to use the drugs payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The monthly threshold is due to increase to &euro;85 from 1 January 2005. In light of the protection from excessive drug costs provided by the GMS and DPS schemes, there are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions under the LTI.</P>

        <P>My Department commenced an evaluation of this project when the ERHA and the NAHB sought funding last year for the provision and fit-out of these facilities &mdash; as construction work approached completion on site.

Once the evaluation is completed, my Department will be in a position to make a recommendation in respect of the provision of funding for this project.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that section 98(<i>a</i>) of the Finance Act 1999, as inserted by section 50 of the Finance Act 2004, provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel.</P>
        <P>The details of the scheme, which includes pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol, are being finalised in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The European Commission has confirmed that the scheme would represent a State aid and, consequently, its approval is required. The EU energy tax directive of 2003 envisages such tax relief and the Commission has approved schemes for excise relief of biofuel in other EU member states. My Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources have had a number of meetings with European Commission officials in respect of this and it is expected that a formal application for Commission approval will be made shortly. Assuming approval is granted, the necessary commencement order will then be signed. Following this, the project selection and approval process will be set in train.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of spouses and children&rsquo;s schemes for civil servants. While the rules of the schemes are broadly similar, entitlements and restrictions can vary from scheme to scheme. Under the rules of these schemes the term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; means the surviving spouse of a marriage which is accepted as valid under the law of the State. Accordingly, the rules of the spouses and children&rsquo;s schemes recognise the entitlement of a surviving spouse, as defined above, who is either living apart from or legally separated from the deceased member of the scheme. Entitlement ceases, as a general rule, in cases of divorce.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that the terms of a valid pensions adjustment order issued by the courts will take precedence over the rules of the schemes. In the case of the spouses and children&rsquo;s pension schemes an order in relation to benefits may be made in favour of the dependent spouse and-or a person for the benefit of a dependent child, subject to certain conditions. Such an order is served on the trustees of the pension scheme and requires that a specified part of the benefit or benefits must be paid by them to the person or persons named in the order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The treatment of maintenance payments in the case of separated spouses is governed by section 1025 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The section deals with payments made under a maintenance arrangement. A maintenance arrangement is defined as an order of court, rule of court, deed of separation, trust, covenant, agreement or arrangement or any other act giving rise to a legally enforceable arrangement and made or done in consequence of the separation or the annulment or dissolution of a marriage.</P>
        <P>Where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, then tax law provides that a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his or her spouse is granted to the paying spouse and the payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse; or the separated couple may jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place and, where such an election is made, the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.</P><Col N="1072"/>
        <P>Where a payment made under a maintenance arrangement is for the benefit of a child, the parent making the payment is not entitled to tax deduction in respect of such payment and the payment is not regarded for income tax purposes as the income of the other parent or as income of the child.</P>
        <P>Where a separated couple has not jointly elected to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place and where either spouse has dependent children resident with him or her at any time during the tax year, the one parent family tax credit is due in addition to the basic personal tax credit. Where custody of a child is shared between spouses and the child is resident with both spouses at intervals during the tax year, the one-parent family tax credit is due to both spouses in respect of the same child. Cohabiting couples living together as man and wife may not claim the credit.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific issue raised by the Deputy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing tax law, a spouse in receipt of legally binding maintenance payments is not entitled to the maintenance tax relief due to the spouse paying the maintenance or any money gained from tax relief, for example, a refund arising in the case of a retrospective claim in relief. There are no plans to change the current arrangements regarding the taxation of maintenance payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin Port is under the control and management of Dublin Port Company, which is in State ownership. The company is one of ten port companies established under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 and operating under the aegis of the Department. The Harbours Acts provide that the principal objects of each of these companies include the provision of such facilities, services, accommodation and lands in its harbour for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary. Ireland&rsquo;s commercial ports are vital transport arteries, carrying 99% by volume of our external trade. However, the internal resources of our commercial ports are not sufficient in general to fund large-scale infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>The Department has drafted a comprehensive ports policy statement which I intend to publish in the near future. One of the major policy areas addressed by the policy statement will be how to meet the predicted deficit in seaport capacity. The Department has commissioned independent consultants, Baxter Eadie Limited, to prepare a series of reports on seaport capacity and future projected capacity needs. Earlier this year, Baxter Eadie Limited prepared a desk study update in order to identify the effect Ireland&rsquo;s changing economic circumstances have had on projected capacity needs at the seaports. The study takes into account current economic growth projections and looks at capacity up to 2014.</P>
        <P>Looking to 2014, the study has found that traffic is expected to grow by 16.2 million tonnes, some 35% above tonnage handled in 2003, while growth in capacity over the same period is projected at a very low level, about 1% over the period. These projections are based on known changes which have full approval for implementation and do not include any other plans for infrastructure improvements. A capacity shortfall of 12.2 million tonnes is projected by 2014. The consultants state that the situation warrants <Col N="1074"/>decisions and further action in order to avoid increasing delays and congestion in some ports, particularly for unit load cargoes.</P>
        <P>The Department recognises that the study by Baxter Eadie Limited is necessarily an inexact exercise, the implications of which will need to be checked against actual experience in each of the ports. In the context of the ports policy statement, it is necessary that a policy framework be put in place to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner. The proposal by Dublin Port Company for the provision of a new port facility on the northern side of the port would fall to be considered within this proposed policy framework along with all other proposals from the public and private sectors to address the potential capacity deficit.</P>
        <P>Dublin Port Company claims ownership of certain areas of foreshore in Dublin Bay, including the area in which the company proposes to reclaim some 21 hectares. Evidence of ownership of the area in question provided by Dublin Port Company has been examined for the Department by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and it is expected that consideration of this matter will be finalised in the near future.</P>
        <P>If it is established that the foreshore in question is in the ownership of the company, the proposed reclamation would fall to be considered under section 10, as amended, of the Foreshore Act 1933. Reclamation of State-owned foreshore, on the other hand, requires authorisation by way of a foreshore lease granted under section 2 of that Act. In either event, consideration of Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s application will involve a process of public consultation in which interested persons and organisations will have an opportunity to make submissions on relevant issues.</P>
        <P>The EIS prepared by the company in respect of the proposed reclamation would be made available as part of any public consultation on the proposal. Certain matters relating to that document are under consideration. Dublin Port Company will also have to apply for planning permission for the proposed reclamation. As the Deputy will be aware, I have no function with regard to the granting of planning permission.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the replies to Question No. 137 on 13 October 2004, Question No. 95 on 21 October 2004 and Question No. 243 on 17 November 2004 giving the up-to-date position as regards the pier development pro<Col N="1075"/>posed by Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, which I will outline again.</P>
        <P>On 6 September 2004 a meeting took place between the commissioners and the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Browne. Following the meeting, the Minister of State wrote to the commissioners setting out his understanding of the outcome of the meeting and of how to ensure that the dialogue between the Department and the commissioners can be progressed in the future on a positive basis. The letter reiterated that the interruption in the dialogue between the Department and the commissioners and the referral of the matter to the Attorney General was a direct consequence of the unilateral decision by the commissioners to sign a contract in March 2002 for the construction of the pier. This occurred while discussions with the Department on the viability of the project were ongoing.</P>
        <P>The Department has received advice from the Attorney General on the proposed pier development. However, no decisions have been taken by the Department on foot of this advice on the contract entered into by the commissioners.</P>
        <P>The former Minister of State&rsquo;s letter further indicated that from the discussions which had taken place, it appeared the commissioners believed the business environment for the project had shifted from that originally envisaged. The projected costs had escalated since the consideration of Exchequer support of &euro;1.9 million by the former Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. Furthermore, no progress appeared to have been made on the conditions contained in the former Minister of State&rsquo;s letter of 15 May 2002, which expressly instructed the commissioners not to enter into any contractual commitments pending a report on progress on two stipulated conditions. These conditions relate to negotiations with the terminal operator.</P>
        <P>The former Minister of State proposed in his letter to the commissioners that the project be reviewed in terms of its viability, the financial implications for the commissioners of increased borrowings for the project due to its escalated cost and the risks to the project posed by the dominant position of the terminal operator. To this end, the Department has invited the commissioners to submit for consideration a fully detailed updated proposal for the project, including a business plan with financial tables.</P>
        <P>The proposed course set out is a sound basis for progressing the matter and I look forward to the Department receiving for consideration the updated proposal from the commissioners in due course. I would like to clarify that consideration of any updated proposal from the commissioners by the Department in due course will be subject to the availability of funding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The promotion of renewable energy technologies is a key priority of this Government. The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published in 1999 established a target to add 500 MW of new renewable energy based electricity generating plant to the electricity network by 2005. In addition, at the launch of AER VI, my predecessor announced support for an additional 50 MW of new generating capacity in an offshore wind category and an additional 28 MW specific to biomass powered CHP plants. Subsequently at the announcement of the initial round of offers in AER VI it was proposed to add a further 140 MW to the original 500 MW target subject to State aids clearance.</P>
        <P>The necessary State aids clearance was received recently and I announced the allocations, by category and by applicants, of the remaining unallocated AER VI support last Monday, 13 December. Full details of the successful applicants and the allocations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>AER VI brings to a close an initial programme to add renewable energy technologies to the network at a level which does not raise serious technical issues. However, planning for future programmes at increased penetration levels does cause significant technical issues which must be addressed to maintain system security for electricity customers. This plan may in turn require a revision of the current support programme to embrace changes required to allow higher levels of wind energy penetration in particular.</P>
        <P>At the end of last year a consultation document was published entitled, Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Prog<Col N="1077"/>rammes. The consultation document and supporting annexes, which examine in detail support mechanisms and renewable energy policies in Ireland and in other European countries, were published on my Department&rsquo;s website. They examined key future challenges, including policy, future green energy markets, how to overcome barriers to the deployment of renewable energy and future options for market support mechanisms.</P>
        <P>In May this year a renewable energy development group was established chaired by my Department. The group comprises relevant experts from the administrative and scientific sectors which interact appropriately with key market players. This group will advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy to 2010 and beyond. The group is aware that the European Commission determined that the AER programme involved the payment of State aid to the generators supported by the programmes. It will take the issue into account in any recommendations it may make in its report. This report, which is due shortly, will form the basis of my future policy decisions.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this work programme administered by my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy, including deployment of renewable energy sources, has commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology research and development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing database in the Passport Office does not classify passport holders by age and it is not possible, therefore, to give a precise figure for the number of passports issued to children under 18 years of age. However, the Passport Office estimates that approximately 4 million passports have been issued in the past ten years and that, of these, about 20% or 800,000 were issued to minors.</P><Col N="1078"/>
        <P>The new automated passport issuing system being introduced has a much greater capacity to produce management information reports and, when fully implemented, will be able to give a breakdown of passports issued by age as well as other criteria.</P>
        <P>The Passport Office does not record the immigration status of foreign nationals who apply for passports on behalf of their Irish born children. It is not possible, therefore, to indicate how many passports have been issued in the past three years to children whose parents were about to be deported.</P>

	<P>The allocation for 2005 provides for an increase of &euro;60 million in Government spending on official development assistance next year. This will bring total Government aid to the developing world to approximately &euro;535 million in 2005. In addition, the Government has agreed to make further increases of &euro;65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. These substantial increases mean that &euro;1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance over the coming three years. I welcome these increases.</P>
        <P>The three year, multi-annual commitment, incorporating substantial annual increases, gives my Department a sound basis to carry forward the long-term planning which is so important for development work. The Government remains committed to reaching the 0.7% target as soon as possible. We will examine the question of a revised timetable in the new year to see how we can best take this forward.</P>

	<P>The enterprise strategy group was established by the T&aacute;naiste to prepare a report that would serve as a blueprint for an enterprise strategy for growth and employment in Ireland. Under its terms of reference, the group was asked to develop a medium-term enterprise strategy and propose and prioritise national policy responses which would: strengthen the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise environment; promote the emergence of an innovative and knowledge driven economy; ensure balanced regional development; sustain, where feasible, those industries already providing significant employment; underpin the industries of the future where Ireland is or can become a substantial player with particular reference to segments of the ICT, life sciences, food, financial services and internationally traded services sectors; encourage business start-ups and companies with potential for growth; and examine the scope for increasing the value of sectors to the economy as a whole.</P>
        <P>In this context the group was asked to take into account a number of important domestic and external factors which will determine our future growth potential. These included long-term international trends in globalisation, EU enlargement, technology and regulation, as well as in the developing structure of industries and markets and Ireland&rsquo;s increased prosperity and changing cost and competitiveness base.</P><Col N="1081"/>
        <P>The Government considered the report of the enterprise group in advance of its publication on 7 July last. Due to the large number of recommendations made and the fact that they impacted on a number of Departments and agencies, the Government decided to set up a high level committee to consider the implications of the report and the best manner to address its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The report contains 51 recommendations, approximately half of which are appropriate to Departments other than mine. Accordingly, ten Departments were represented on the committee. Given the widespread nature of these recommendations, their importance and, in certain cases, their complexity, detailed analyses and extensive consultations were required. My understanding is that the committee expects to finalise its report in the near future and I propose to present it to Cabinet colleagues immediately thereafter.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that a specific plan will be drafted on each recommendation to be implemented. These would be closely monitored to ensure their implementation within a specified timeframe.</P>
        <P>While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific recommendations in advance of receiving the report of the high level committee and communicating my views to Government colleagues, I am aware that some of the recommendations in the report reflect initiatives already under way or envisaged in Departments and agencies. For example, prior to the publication of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report in July of this year, the Government on 22 June 2004 approved a new co-ordination and governance system for STI, which included the establishment of the position of chief science adviser to the Government, a post which was filled with effect from 1 September.</P>
        <P>I do not need to outline the challenges we face in an increasingly competitive environment. The decisions we make now must ensure Ireland <Col N="1082"/>remains a dynamic economy. I look forward, therefore, to receiving the report of the high level committee.</P>

            <?oasys _xr?>*These patents, granted by the European Patents Office, Munich, have been entered in the national register of patents and have the same legal status in Ireland as if they had been granted by the Patents Office.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Information on the numbers of patents granted is published each year in the annual report of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks. The Irish Council for Science and Technology, ICSTI, in its statement on commercialisation of publicly funded research in February 2001 made specific recommendations on increasing resources for industry-research liaison, encouraging commercialisation and increasing early stage funding for research with commercial potential. ICSTI has since published a code of practice directed at encouraging research performing bodies to introduce systems and procedures to ensure research results are protected and exploited effectively.</P>
        <P>A number of actions have been undertaken by Enterprise Ireland to develop and enhance the commercialisation of valuable research which has been undertaken for the ultimate benefit of the economy. It has taken a lead with other funding agencies to ensure best practice commercialisation provisions are included in research funding contracts. Enterprise Ireland offers financial and expert advisory resources to support industrial liaison or commercialisation offices within third level institutions. It also provides advisory and financial support to third level institutions and companies on the protection, development and commercialisation of inventions, including funding for patent applications. Enterprise Ireland was also recently one of the sponsors of an intellectual property advisory booklet produced by the Irish Exporters Association and participated in workshops run by the association.</P>
        <P>While the principal statutory role of the Patents Office is the grant of rights in the fields of patents, trade marks and designs, the office also seeks to raise awareness of the importance of intellectual property rights through the dissemination of information on these areas, principally via its website, <i>www.patentsoffice.ie</i>. The office also seeks to encourage use of the patents system through the production of guides and booklets on paper and on CD-ROM dealing with the acquisition of patent rights in Ireland, Europe and throughout the world.</P>

	<P>Weighing equipment used for trade is subject to control by the Legal Metrology Service in accordance with the Metrology Acts 1980 to 1998. The regime of control includes approval of new designs of weighing equipment, verification of instruments of an approved design upon installation and following repair or recalibration and inspection over the life of the instruments.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Legal Metrology Service that, based on requirements laid down by the Department of Agriculture and Food some years ago, arrangements were put in place to carry out additional checks on weighing instruments in meat plants involved in the various European Union and Government schemes. These checks, which were over and above those required under metrology law, were carried out at two to three monthly intervals.</P>
        <P>Following identification of a number of serious health and safety risks the testing of weighing equipment used for trade in meat processing plants was reviewed during the period 2002 to 2004. During the review process limited inspections were carried out and these did not reveal any discrepancies.</P>
        <P>Discussions took place between the Legal Metrology Service, the Irish Meat Association, IBEC and the Department of Agriculture and Food regarding appropriate procedures to be followed during testing so as to minimise or eliminate health and safety risks. An agreement has recently been reached on a revised set of requirements which must be met by processing plants to facilitate testing by the Legal Metrology Service. It is intended to resume inspection as required under the metrology law or by the Department of Agriculture and Food early in 2005. Issues relating to refunds to farmers do not fall within the remit of my Department or the Legal Metrology Service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economy is undergoing fundamental change, which is affecting all sectors of our economy. Ireland can no longer be regarded as a low cost location for investment as our strengths and competitive advantages have inexorably changed. High output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards now typify the economy. As a result, Ireland is no longer regarded as a location for what could be called basic low-tech production and is being overtaken by low wage economies in terms of cost competitiveness. However, no measure is available to quantify jobs that may have relocated to other countries.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its most recent annual competitiveness reports has identified as a high priority the need to recover Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness to ensure sustained economic success in the future.</P>
        <P>With regard to insurance costs, comparison of insurance figures in European countries is available in the European Insurance in Figures, June 2004 report published by the Comit&eacute; Europ&eacute;en Des Assurances, CEA, which shows details of average non-life premiums per inhabitant. These figures include motor and public liability insurance. The figures for 2002, which are the latest given, show that of 31 European countries listed, Ireland ranked fifth highest with a value of &euro;1,006, Luxembourg was highest with a value of &euro;2,143, Switzerland was second highest with a value of &euro;1,730, while the Netherlands was third highest with a value of &euro;1,240. The United Kingdom, with a value of &euro;1,183, was fourth highest. Lithuania was second lowest with a value of &euro;53 and Turkey was lowest with a value of &euro;25. The average premium in Europe in 2001 was &euro;619.</P>
        <P>The ratios need to be analysed carefully. The figures comparing premium amounts to the number of inhabitants do not correspond to sums actually paid by those insured. In addition, these figures do not always include only or all premia <Col N="1086"/>paid by the inhabitants of the country concerned. These 2002 comparisons do not reflect recent experience in Ireland, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme. Indications to date are that the cost of insurance in Ireland is falling. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was a reduction of 20% in motor car insurance between the months of April 2002, when the first Motor Insurance Advisory Board report was published, and October 2004 which is the latest figure available. There are also reported reductions in the cost of premia for public and employer liability insurance.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to pursuing actions to address cost issues in other areas and has already taken several measures in this regard. In the area of competition, the Government has strengthened the powers and the resources of the Competition Authority to enable it to continue in its role to tackle anti-competitive behaviour in sectors of the economy. Competition is working well in many sectors of the economy but Ireland cannot afford to have sectors of the economy sheltered from competition.</P>
        <P>Furthermore the Competition Authority is undertaking reviews of certain building, legal, medical and construction professions, which will address competition issues in the sheltered sectors of the economy. It must be remembered that competition is the most efficient method of ensuring prices are kept low and at optimal levels for consumers and businesses alike.</P>
        <P>The Government earlier this year established the consumer strategy group to advise and make recommendations for the development of a national consumer policy. In the performance of this role the consumer strategy group has carried out a range of activities, including studies that investigate issues of special concern. Price trends with other parts of Europe have been examined and some prices have been the subject of additional investigation, including those of fruit and vegetables, alcoholic beverages and pharmaceuticals. The group will report to me early in the new year and I plan to give the report prompt attention and consideration as soon as I receive it.</P>

	<P>Ireland exports around the globe. The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to create further market opportunities by assisting companies to deepen market penetration where they are established and to establish in new markets where export opportunities exist. Through Enterprise Ireland, the Government supports the growth of exports by working with individual companies in identi<Col N="1087"/>fying new product and market opportunities and devising and implementing appropriate strategies to capitalise on them.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?>
        <P>New market opportunities are explored by the Enterprise Ireland overseas office network. It provides market intelligence for potential buyers and for the different economic sectors. That information is made available to Enterprise Ireland clients and incorporated, as appropriate, in their company development plans. In addition, the Enterprise Ireland annual business review comprehensively addresses the sales and export markets of clients, and specifically focuses on designated priority markets in the period under review.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland develops new market opportunities for clients by arranging meetings with significant international buyers, either through inward buyer missions or outward trade missions. To date this year, 15 overseas trade missions to countries in Europe, North and South America, the Middle East and Asia have been lead respectively by the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State. European and North American markets continue to dominate our export and import trade. The United States is now our largest export market, accounting for approximately 20% of total exports. The UK now accounts for approximately 17% of exports. However, when taken together, the member countries of the European Union are of primary importance to our exporters. They account for approximately 62% of exports to date this year.</P>
        <P>The UK continues to be our largest source of imports, accounting for 30% of the total, while the EU as a whole accounts for 57%. In recent years, China has become a much more important source of imports than heretofore, and so far this year accounted for approximately 5.5% of imports. The USA accounts for approximately 14.6% of the total.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have become a more sophisticated and developed economy in which the application of technology and intellectual endeavour is becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for growth and prosperity. We now have one of the most open economies in the world in which trends in world trade, global business investment and consumer decisions directly influence the pattern of economic growth, company development and job prospects more so than in other developed economies.</P>
        <P>A balanced combination of pro-enterprise policies has helped propel economic growth and employment expansion and these have encouraged deeper and stronger links to both the enlarging European Union markets and internationally. Consequently, enterprise and society have benefited significantly from the ability of entrepreneurs to operate more profitably both in and from Ireland.</P>
        <P>Naturally a more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably entice some firms which are unable to generate their required return from the modern enterprise economy into which we have transformed. A continuing structural evolution of our economy is both unavoidable and necessary to maintain present levels of growth and low unemployment. With this, some plant transfers and other adjustments are bound to come, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low technology, labour intensive activities.</P>
        <P>To counterbalance the competitive threat from lower wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value added products and services. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability which are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of the economy and are, therefore, less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. This new investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. The enterprise development agencies have a clear mandate to align their operations with this policy objective.</P>
        <P>The latest data from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s quarterly national household survey shows that employment increased by 57,200 on the corresponding period in 2003, bringing the total number in employment to a record 1,893,600. This is a remarkable achievement at a time when there is considerable debate and comment about the impact of competition from lower wage economies on employment levels in developed economies.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for ensuring that the skills requirements of industry are met rests with industry. There are already in place a number of initiatives and measures through which the Government seeks to work with industry and workers to identify and address the skills needs of the economy. They include F&Aacute;S training services to business and the national craft certificate as well as the national training fund which supports employee training actions, including F&Aacute;S training, IDA and Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development training grants, Skillnets network training and upskilling and training projects in individual sectors. The expert group on future skills needs, also supported by the NTF, provides assessments of and advice for appropriate action on future skill needs. My Department and the Department of Education and Science are pursuing the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the task force on life learning.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming year includes provision for supporting greater use of the European Social Fund in the area of in-company training and provision for a workplace based education programme. The recommendation by the enterprise strategy group of a one step up for all is now a guiding element in my Department&rsquo;s approach to employee training. The objective of these initiatives and measures is to provide support to ensure that the skill needs of the economy continue to be met.</P>

	<P>The provision of support to companies for the creation of employment is a day-to-day operational matter for the industrial development agencies under my remit, namely, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and the county enterprise boards. I am assured by these agencies that they are actively promoting County Cork, including Youghal and Cobh, for new investment and jobs on an ongoing basis, with Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Board focusing on the development of indigenous industries, and IDA Ireland concentrating on marketing the county as a location for foreign direct investment.</P><Col N="1090"/>
        <P>As part of its role in regional development, the Enterprise Ireland regional Cork office works with other regional organisations and third level institutions to improve the business climate at regional level for agency clients. At a county level, just under &euro;28 million has been approved since 2002 for Enterprise Ireland client companies in the city and county of Cork.</P>
        <P>In terms of employment creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs set up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing innovation capability at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>There are 140 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the east Cork area, which includes Youghal and Cobh, with a total employment of 3,681. Since 1998 employment in Enterprise Ireland companies in the county has been positive in every year, with the exception of 2001 when there was a net loss of 296 jobs. The Forf&aacute;s annual employment survey is the indicator used to record jobs gained and lost in Enterprise Ireland and other agencies in any one year. The 2004 survey is being completed and data will be available by the end of January 2005.</P>
        <P>The wide range of supports offered by Enterprise Ireland to its client companies to facilitate their growth includes strategy development, production and operations, marketing, human resources development, finance and research and development. Companies also have access to market and technical information via the agency&rsquo;s 32 offices worldwide.</P>
        <P>Regarding IDA Ireland, the towns of Cobh and Youghal are marketed by IDA south west region as part of the broader east Cork area. IDA Ireland is promoting east Cork to potential investors on an ongoing basis and every effort is being made to secure further advanced knowledge based industry for the area.</P>
        <P>From an inward investment perspective Cobh and Youghal, due to their proximity to the greater Cork area, also benefit from continued development where over the past ten years direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork city and county has grown from 10,345 in 1993 to 18,162 in 2003. The sectors contributing to this growth are ICT, pharmaceuticals-medical technologies and international services.</P>
        <P>This growth is expected to continue into the future with IDA in 2003 announcing 11 new projects for Cork with the potential to create up to 800 new jobs and in 2004. Five new projects, Centocor, Altera, Ecora, AK pharmaceuticals and McAfee, have been announced with a job creation potential in excess of 800 new jobs. In the 2002-04 period more than 50% of all jobs announced in Cork came from companies locating in the broader east Cork area, making this area the primary jobs beneficiary from inward investment in the south west region.</P><Col N="1091"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>The county enterprise board with responsibility for Youghal and Cork is the South Cork County Enterprise Board, SCCEB, which since its inception has approved a total of &euro;175,734 to ten projects in the Youghal and Cobh region and paid out a total of &euro;169,384 in capital assistance. In the past two years the board has specifically focused on developing training initiatives in the area and is conducting a wide range of training programmes in order to assist participants in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>
        <P>SCCEB, in conjunction with the other support agencies, continues to maintain an active presence in the region informing the public of the supports available. The board will continue to work to support new and existing businesses to operate effectively and efficiently to ensure survival and growth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to work allowance scheme incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain their social welfare payment on a tapered rate over a three or four year period when they take up employment or self-employment. Participants in the scheme may also retain secondary benefits for the three or four year period.</P>
        <P>An evaluation of the scheme carried out by independent consultants has shown that 78% of those who participated in the scheme had not returned to the live register. In the event that a participant does not claim back to work allowance for the full period of entitlement, that is, three years in the case of the employee strand or four years in the case of the self-employment strand, then, subject to satisfying all the usual conditions, he or she may apply for unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
        <P>The period spent participating in the back to work allowance scheme is not treated as a period of unemployment as the recipient is in insurable employment while receiving a payment under the scheme and there is no link back to the previous period of employment for the purposes of calculating the cumulative total days of the unemployment claim. A person who claims unemployment assistance after a period on the back to work allowance scheme would be entitled to a payment of a Christmas bonus after 15 months on such assistance payment.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 255 of 9 November 2004, the primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus-based public transport. Except in the case of contra-flow bus lanes, a range of other road users are permitted, by regulation, to use bus lanes. These include cyclists, taxi vehicles while available for immediate on-street hire, fire brigades, ambulances and vehicles driven by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of duty.</P>
        <P>A review of the access issue was carried out in 2001. As part of that review, the views of a number of bodies representing various road user groups, including motorcyclists, were considered. In addition, views of the director of traffic in Dublin City Council, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were sought. All the latter bodies indicated that there should be no change to the current position. I have no immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users. In the context of the current situation, no trials have been undertaken here based on motor cyclists using a bus lane.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 to 154, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The community development programme, CDP, supports locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities so that they can contribute to a process of change in their areas and improve the quality of life of their communities.</P>
        <P>One of the unique and valuable characteristics of the community development programme is the management of projects by local communities. In this regard, projects are expected to ensure that the management committee is composed of rep<Col N="1100"/>resentation of people from their target groups. This approach ensures that those who experience poverty and social exclusion have a real say in the responses developed to meet their needs and that such responses genuinely target those who are most at risk of poverty. Moreover, target group involvement in the development process is key to ensuring local ownership of projects and the promotion of active citizenship in local communities.</P>
        <P>At present some 175 projects are participating in the programme in urban and rural areas. I recently announced an additional ten projects currently at pre-development stage for inclusion in the community development programme, with a total budget commitment of &euro;60,000 each for their first year of operation.</P>
        <P>The total funding allocated in 2004 to the community development programme was &euro;20.6 million. The CDPs have also secured in excess of &euro;20 million for their communities from other sources. The projects provide a wide range of activities targeting the most disadvantaged. These include: community-based child care for people on low incomes; training, education and adult literacy; homework and after-schools clubs for children in disadvantaged communities; health projects; advice and guidance for all sectors of the community and; meeting facilities and administration services for community activities.</P>
        <P>Following the submission of approximately 100 projects within the community development programme of their 2003 annual report using the SPEAK, strategic planning evaluation and knowledge networking, software the following statistics have been produced. In 2003, projects supported over 700 other local issue groups. Over 1,000 people are involved in CDP management committees. Management committees are largely made up of representatives of the projects target communities. Target communities for the projects include the following: Travellers, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, lone parents, disadvantaged elderly, disadvantaged women, disadvantaged young people, and other groups experiencing poverty.</P>
        <P>Some 15,000 people participated in training and education courses organised by the projects. Over 30,000 individuals in disadvantaged communities used the CDPs services. Some 12,000 meetings of other local community groups took place using the projects facilities. The Government highly values the work being done by individual projects funded under the programme and the impact the work is having on countering social exclusion, as evidenced by this data.</P>
        <P>Like all organisations receiving Government funding, community development projects are accountable to the State and to their communities for the management of such funding. In that context, the community development programme cannot be described as a wholly autonomous programme operating independently of its funders and other social exclusion initiatives. I am <Col N="1101"/>committed to protecting the distinctive local community structure and input of each of the CDP projects, while enabling improved linkages, dialogue and access to resources, across local and community development bodies. My Department is therefore keen to promote enhanced levels of co-operation between all the various stakeholders involved in combating social exclusion. To this end, I recently announced details of a funding package of over &euro;3.2 million which will encourage realignment and worksharing between different agencies and the extension of social inclusion projects to give complete coverage across administrative areas.</P>

	<P>The person named included a land parcel on his 2004 area aid application, which was also claimed by another herdowner. Both herdowners were written to by my Department and the person named accepted that he was not entitled to claim area aid on the parcel concerned. The herdowner claimed 2.21 hectares on the aforementioned parcel. This over-claim amounted to 34% of his total forage area claimed and, consequently, he would not be entitled to payment under the 2004 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The named person will not be entitled to benefit from livestock premia if the stocking density, based on the determined area of 6.50 hectares, is greater than 1.8 livestock units per hectare in accordance with the provisions for over-declaration of land under the relevant EU regulations.</P>
        <P>The person named applied for premium on two animals under the 2004 suckler cow premium scheme. The application has been processed and the two animals are eligible for payment. However, payment cannot issue yet as it will be necessary to await the end of the special beef premium application period on 31 December 2004 to establish if the area found is sufficient to support a stocking density of 1.8 livestock units per hectare in respect of the animals claimed.</P>
        <P>To date, no applications have been received under the 2004 special beef premium scheme from the person named. The application period remains open however until the end of December 2004.</P>
        <P>Under the 2004 EU slaughter premium scheme, to date, one animal has been deemed eligible for payment to the person named. The 60% advance payment in the amount of &euro;48.00 issued on 20 October 2004 in respect of this animal.</P>
        <P>Since the person named did not apply for either suckler cow premium or special beef premium in 2003, he is not eligible for payment of the 2003 extensification premium. He has submitted an <Col N="1102"/>application under the 2004 extensification premium scheme. Payments under the 2004 scheme are due to commence in June 2005.

Following an examination of these applications, he was informed that both the new entrant and inheritance applications were successful. However, the inheritance measure, which is the inherited entitlements combined with those earned by the person involved, in his own right, was more favourable than either the <i>force majeure</i> or the new entrant measures and generated the highest single farm payment.</P>

The current EU regulations stipulate that the national sugar quota must be allocated to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, the entire Irish sugar quota has been allocated to Irish Sugar Ltd., which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. The company in turn places contracts with farmers to grow sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota. There is no specific quota for sugar beet.</P>
        <P>The issue of quota ownership has been raised in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of the EU sugar regime. The proposals envisage the possibility of cross-border mobility of sugar quotas in the future. Several member states, including Ireland, are opposed to this idea. The Commission is not expected to bring forward formal legislative proposals until May or June of next year. If the proposal for quota mobility is maintained, then the Commission will also propose appropriate rules to deal with that situation. I have already been in contact with the Office of the Attorney General in anticipation of that eventuality. However, one of my main priorities in the upcoming negotiations is to ensure that mobility of quota is not allowed.</P>

	<P>Under existing legislation, namely, regulation 13 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, the writing of prescriptions of prescription only medicines, POMs, is restricted to veterinary surgeons.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising a package of amendments to the existing legislation governing the national regime and the animal rem<Col N="1105"/>edies consultative committee will be consulted on these in the near future. One of the key objectives of these amendments is to make the prescribing regime more effective and workable. This would be achieved by removing some inflexibility from the current regime and, with appropriate safeguards, according greater weight to the professional judgment of a veterinary surgeon as to when a clinical examination of animals under his or her care would be necessary.</P>
        <P>However, it is not my intention in the current environment to extend the range of persons who would be enabled to prescribe veterinary medicines which have been designated prescription only. It is intended to extend, where appropriate, the range of outlets which could supply on foot of a prescription to include the licensed merchant category. I believe that these proposed changes will represent significant steps in making the regime more workable and effective in the current environment, while safeguarding public health.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Balbriggan Garda station as at 16 December is 34, all ranks. The personnel strength of Balbriggan Garda station as at 1 December 1989 was 28, all ranks. This represents an increase of 6, or 21%, in the number of garda&iacute; allocated to Balbriggan since that date. Balbriggan forms part of the Louth-Meath division. The personnel strength of the division as at 16 December is 536, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Louth-Meath division as at 31 December 1989 was 473, all ranks. This represents an increase of 63, 13.3%, in the number of garda&iacute; allocated to the Louth-Meath division since that date. It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division to ensure that optimum use is made of the existing resources within it.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the key commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. Its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. The needs of the Louth-Meath division will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the State. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. The additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing, having a real impact.</P>

In addition, 24 members of superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner rank will retire on compulsory age grounds during 2005 at the age of 60.</P>
        <P>All members who may chose to retire voluntarily during 2005, having attained 30 years service and reached 50 years of age or more, will be between 50 and 57 years of age at the rank of Garda sergeant and inspector, or be between 50 and 60 years of age at the rank of superintendent, chief superintendent or assistant commissioner.

        <P>I have no plans to increase the retirement age for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were recruited to the force prior to 1 April 2004.

        <P FLI="0">The Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons imposes obligations on each state in a transfer to exchange extensive documentation prior to a decision being made on the application. Collation and consideration of this documentation can take some time. Under Irish legislation, it is a further requirement that a High Court warrant be obtained to authorise transfer and continued detention in this jurisdiction. In addition, Irish prison officers are required to provide the escort for prisoners transferring into this country under the legislation. Due to necessary cutbacks in overtime levels in the Irish Prison Service, as well as for operational reasons, it has been necessary for the Irish Prison Service to restrict such prison transfers into Ireland to one per month.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process an application for transfer to Ireland varies from case to case. The average process time for transfers effected from the United Kingdom to Ireland between 2000 and 2004, to date, is 21 months. This is from the time the application is received from the United Kingdom authorities until a transfer is effected. A number of applications, at different stages of the process, are on hand in my Department.</P>

St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has a capacity for 220 prisoners. In addition, each of the prisons in the State can accommodate persons aged 17 years and over.

        </table><Col N="1109"/>
        <P FLI="0">Every effort is made to separate juvenile offenders from the general prison population in each institution. The majority of male juvenile offenders are held in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. For example, on 10 December 2004, there were 78 male persons under the age of 18 in custody, 65 of whom were detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The few held in the more traditional adult prisons are accommodated with other young <Col N="1110"/>offenders or with other carefully selected prisoners.</P>
        <P>Offenders under the age of 15 years cannot be committed to a prison under any circumstances. Fifteen year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances. This can occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act 1908, that the young person is so unruly <Col N="1111"/>or depraved of character that he or she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>All institutions in the prison service are the property of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The prison service will accommodate any juvenile that is lawfully committed from the courts. There are no circumstances where the prison service will refuse to accommodate a juvenile that is lawfully committed to its custody.</P>
        <P>With regard to rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, within the prison system, facilities and programmes for young offenders are centred mainly at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The diverse range of services provided include individual and group programmes on offending issues; education, vocational training and life skills programmes; drug treatment and drug awareness programmes. A designated drug-free wing has been in operation in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution since November 2000. This wing allows prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse and those who have demonstrated the desire to stop taking drugs to be detained in a drug-free and secure environment. One-to-one interventions exist and support including general medical, dental, psychiatric, psychological, spiritual and welfare supports, and involvement of community-based voluntary organisations in providing positive programmes and supports for young people in custody.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has, over the past four years, introduced important new programmes for the rehabilitation of offenders including a positive sentence management programme. Resources permitting, it is planned in 2005 to bring a mixture of new and renovated accommodation into use at the institution, through the utilisation of the newly revamped B wing, which will allow for a total of 44 16 and 17 year olds to be accommodated separately from older prisoners.</P>
       <?oasys _ic0-?> <P>The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. It is the underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. The Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations when other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed. The Act is being implemented on a phased basis.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Children&rsquo;s Act 2001, which is being implemented on a phased <Col N="1112"/>basis, over a number of years, separate secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. The Irish Prison Service is actively pursuing the provision of new facilities to be used as children detention centres. These centres will operate under their own unique regime which will cater specifically for the needs of juvenile offenders. In the Dublin area, it is hoped to provide a new children detention centre as part of the planned new prison complex to replace the institutions on the Mountjoy site, including St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. Once a suitable site is acquired, planning and construction will proceed with the intention of having the new facilities available in the shortest possible time. As regards facilities outside Dublin, the new prison complex to replace Cork Prison will also include a stand-alone children detention centre to accommodate 16 to 17 year olds, male and female. A statutory order for the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Children Act will be made when both of these new facilities become available.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal position in relation to transferring prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital is highly unsatisfactory. I intend to introduce new and realistic provisions as part of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, which is awaiting Report Stage in the Seanad and will, I hope, be passed into law before Easter 2005 to deal with the transfer of prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital. In the meantime, such transfers must take place within existing outdated legislation.</P>
        <P>A prisoner on remand certified to be of unsound mind by two doctors may, pursuant to section 13 of the Lunatic (Ireland ) Act 1875 as adapted and extended by the Criminal Justice Act 1960, be removed to the Central Mental Hospital on foot of a ministerial warrant and be held there in confinement until two doctors certify that person to be of sound mind where upon that person, on foot of a ministerial warrant, may be remitted to prison and be brought to court for examination. Therefore, if a remand prisoner, receiving treatment in the Central Mental Hospital is required to appear before the court and if there is not a pressing medical reason preventing such an appearance, the legal route that must be followed is that the prisoner must first be remitted to prison by ministerial warrant and then brought before the court. If the court decides upon a further remand in custody and the medical view is that the prisoner still needs treatment in the Central Mental Hospital, then he or she will be re-certified and be removed there on foot of a ministerial warrant. I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the statistical information on the number of such transfers is not readily available. However, the director general will arrange for the figures to be forwarded directly to the Deputy once they have been compiled.</P>
        <P>The position regarding a person who has been committed to prison for trial is dealt with under section 3 of the Criminal Lunatics (Ireland) Act 1838, as adapted and extended by the Criminal Justice 1960. Such persons if deemed to be insane by two doctors may be removed to the Central Mental Hospital on foot of a ministerial warrant. Their position is more complicated as the question of their fitness to stand trial has to be determined. There is also provision in section 12 of the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum (Ireland) Act 1845, as adapted and extended by the Criminal Justice Act 1960 for sentenced prisoners to be removed to the Central Mental Hospital on foot of a ministerial warrant but these prisoners fall outside the scope of the question.</P><Col N="1114"/>
        <P>In addition to the above, prisoners, who in the opinion of the prison medical officer are suffering from a psychiatric condition for which he or she cannot be afforded appropriate treatment within the institution, may be transferred to an appropriate hospital, including the Central Mental Hospital, on a voluntary basis under section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1914, as adapted. Prisoners, who are in the Central Mental Hospital on a voluntary basis and who have court appearances, would be collected by prison staff and taken to court. After the court appearance, they would be returned to the prison, from where they can be transferred again to the Central Mental Hospital, if required.</P>

	<P>There is an ongoing increase in the number of applications received for permission to remain in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national. There were 156 in 2001, 191 in 2002, 271 in 2003 and 309 in the year to date. The resources allocated to process such applications are necessarily dependent on the prioritised work requirements of the immigration division of my Department at any one time. Some additional resources have recently been allocated to this area and the number of applications on hand have decreased. As a result it is expected that the waiting time for processing such applications will be reduced.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, a Nigerian national, and her four children arrived in the State on 2 July 2001 and she applied for asylum. Her claim was refused by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and she was informed of this decision on 17 July 2002. The applicant then appealed this decision and her appeal was refused on 31 May 2004. The original recommendation is being upheld in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and the family in question was informed on 19 November 2004 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were, in accordance with the Act, given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why they should not be deported, that is, being allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the orders are made; or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Representations setting out the reasons why they should not be deported were received.</P>
        <P>I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision, after consideration of a number of factors which are specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian consideration. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition on <i>refoulement </i>which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 as amended. The person concerned will be notified of my decision as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State in November 2000 and made an application for asylum. His wife arrived in December 2000 and also claimed asylum. In February 2002 his wife gave birth. They withdrew their asylum applications and applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of their parentage of an Irish-born child.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp;  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There is a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a Ministerial proposal to deport them. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. However, the Deputy should be aware that I have recently announced that the Government has approved my proposals to introduce revised arrangements for the processing of claims for permission to remain in the State from non-national parents of Irish-born <Col N="1117"/>children with effect from early 2005. The persons in question may apply for residency in the State under the revised arrangements as they are parents of an Irish-born child.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Finglas Garda station as at the 15 December 2004 was 74 &mdash; all ranks. This figure includes two probationer garda&iacute; who were allocated to Finglas Garda station on 26 November 2004. The personnel strength of Finglas Garda station as at 31 December 1999 was 90 &mdash; all ranks.</P>
        <P>Finglas Garda station forms part of the Dublin metropolitan region &mdash; west &mdash; division. The personnel strength of this division as at 15 December 2004 was 659, all ranks. This figure includes 22 probationer garda&iacute; who were allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region &mdash; west &mdash; division on 26 November 2004, two of whom were allocated to Finglas Garda station. The personnel strength for the same division as at 1 January 1999 was 542, all ranks. This represents an increase of 117, or 21.59%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region &mdash; west &mdash; division since that date.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division to ensure the optimum use is made of the existing <Col N="1118"/>resources within the division. The Deputy will be aware that I provided the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with an extra &euro;4 million, providing 140,000 additional hours overtime for high visibility policing, for the eight weeks leading up to the 31 December 2004.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Crossover II was launched in the Finglas sub-district on 12 November 2004 to target criminal activity. In addition, I am informed that there are a number of initiatives in place to counteract public order offending and anti-social activities in the Finglas area. The area receives regular patrolling by uniformed car and van units with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area. A community police unit is assigned to the area. Patrols are backed up by foot patrols and mountain bike patrols in addition to the divisional crime task force, divisional traffic unit and detective units. I am also informed that the garda&iacute;, in association with neighbourhood watch groups, resident associations and Dublin City Council, co-ordinate and design initiatives to target high incident areas.</P>
        <P>I understand there is currently one juvenile liaison officer working full time with children who offend in the Finglas area. In addition to this there is an active local drugs task force which co-ordinates the efforts of the garda&iacute; the various other agencies and the community in the ongoing fight against drugs. There is also one Garda youth diversion project in the area, the FAN, Finglas Action Now, project. This project is a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved &mdash; or further involved &mdash; in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the project also contributes to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
        <P>With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased to note that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Finglas sub-district will be fully considered within the context of policing needs throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very <Col N="1119"/>significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda Traffic Corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in June 2002. The application was submitted to me for a decision in March 2004 and I decided not to grant a certificate of naturalisation in that instance.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have one year&rsquo;s period of residence in the State before the date of the application and a total of four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight preceding that period. Section 16(<i>g</i>) of that Act provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In considering applications under this provision, I am generally disposed to waive two years of the normal residency requirement, thereby requiring such applicants to be resident in the State for three years at the time of application. This three year period commences from the date the applicant arrived in the State to seek refugee status.</P>
        <P>The reason for my refusal was disclosed to the applicant in the letter informing him of my decision. The applicant arrived in the State on the 5 February 2001 and made his application for a certificate of naturalisation on 5 June 2002. As there were no circumstances apparent in the application which would have lead me to depart from the general policy outlined above, I decided to refuse the application based on the fact that the applicant was not in the State three years at the time of application. Assuming that the person concerned has been resident in the State continually since his arrival here in February 2001, he would now appear to have the appropriate residency. It is open to him to submit a new application at any time. Any such application will be considered against the statutory and administrative provisions in operation at the time the application is submitted.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the 1998 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na annual report recorded 85,627 indictable offences. There were 103,360 headline offences recorded in the 2003 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na annual report. I am not prepared to comment on projected total figures for 2004 until the final provisional statistics have been received by me from the Garda Commissioner. However, as the Deputy will be aware, there was a reduction of 3% in headline offences, and 14% in non-headline offences, in 2003 compared to 2002. This downward trend has continued in 2004, which has seen a reduction of 7% in headline offences for the first nine months of this year compared to the same period for 2003.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the crime statistics since the year 2000 are not directly comparable with those of previous years. This is due to the altered format of the annual report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following the introduction of the PULSE system in 2000.</P>

	<P>The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down by law the maximum penalty appropriate to a particular offence and for the courts, having considered all the circumstances of a case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Legislature lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the courts to exercise discretion in deciding the punishment while taking account of all the circumstances of the case and of the offender.</P>
        <P>The District Court has a reasonably wide range of sentencing options at its disposal including fines, probation orders, community service orders, compensation orders and imprisonment. In light of the geographical organisation of the District Court, it is not unusual that some variation will occur in relation to the penalties imposed for similar offences. The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 enables me, as Minister, to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, in this regard, funds are made available to the judicial studies institute which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
        <P>As regards consistency in sentencing, section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in its report on sentencing which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. The report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission as regards some of the recommendations which tend to underline the obvious complexities that arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
        <P>I note the recommendation made by the commission against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Statutory guidelines would involve an undue interference in the independence of the Judiciary, it is argued. The decision on what type of sentence to impose is a judicial determination and, save only in exceptional circumstances, such as murder, major drug trafficking and certain firearm and explosives offences, the Oireachtas should generally be cautious in prescribing minimum sentences.</P>
        <P>Action has been taken on a number of recommendations contained in the commission&rsquo;s report. For example, the Criminal Law Act 1997 abolished the penalties of penal servitude and impris<Col N="1122"/>onment with hard labour. The issue of sentencing, in general, was addressed in the recent report of the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts. The group, while it did not make final recommendations, drew attention to possible options to promote consistency of sentencing which are being considered in my Department in consultation with the Courts Service.

	<P>Escorts take place outside prison walls for a variety of reasons including visits to hospitals, to court, transfer to other prisons or on humanitarian grounds. Many thousands of escorts take place each year with a significant number of these being for compassionate reasons, such as visiting ill or dying relatives or visits to funeral homes or gravesides. Such releases are extremely important for prisoners and are very rarely abused.</P>
        <P>It is the nature of prison escorts that there will always be an element of risk associated with transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of a closed prison. However, it is a very rare occurrence for prisoners to attempt to escape during such escorts. A balance must be struck between security and the need to operate a humanitarian prison system. It is a question of managing the risk involved. This is reflected in the number of prison staff accompanying the prisoner. Obviously, there are other cases where the level of risk dictates refusal of the request. However, requests are accommodated where possible.</P>
        <P>Decisions on requests for escorted outings are made, on my behalf, by senior officials in the Irish prison service. In some cases, they may be submitted to me. The incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on Sunday, 12 December 2004. The prisoner had made a request to visit his mother, who was terminally ill, in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice, Harold&rsquo;s Cross. An escorted outing was approved on compassionate grounds by a senior official of the Irish prison service. The prisoner visited his mother on Saturday, 11 December 2004 and again the following day as her condition deteriorated. He had also had a previous visit without incident. All visits were accompanied by three prison officers and approval was on the <Col N="1123"/>basis that the prisoner was to be handcuffed at all times. During the visit on Sunday at which a prison chaplain was also in attendance, the prisoner escaped from the hospice.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>The prisoner was serving sentences totalling ten years for robbery, assault and other offences and was due for release in June 2009. An investigation is being carried out by the governor of Mountjoy prison into the incident. The Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to comment in detail at this stage as the investigation is ongoing and I do not wish to prejudice the outcome or any proceedings that may arise out of the incident. However, initial reports suggest that the prisoner slipped the handcuffs, escaped via a patio door and made his getaway into the grounds before scaling a boundary wall. An officer was injured while in pursuit. Staff contacted the prison, which notified the Garda.</P>
        <P>The full report of the investigation into the incident will be forwarded to the director general of the prison service and myself. I fully understand that such incidents cause public concern and, in order to safeguard both the prison staff and the general public, every precaution must be taken to prevent their recurrence.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The cost per prisoner is based on the average daily number of offenders in those institutions during 2003. The operational cost of each institution is based on actual running costs, that is, pay, overtime, food, light and heat, maintenance, etc. These costs include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody is, e.g. staffing numbers, utilities, etc. All headquarters and central service costs are allocated over the prison establishments for the purpose of this calculation. Capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service operates a humane prisoner regime with a high level of out of cell time and access to health, education, work training, psychology and other rehabilitative services. It is constantly striving to ensure it delivers value for money to the State. In 2004, for the first time in years, I reversed the upward trend in prison officer overtime and achieved significant savings. In this context discussions between the prison service and the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association in relation to eliminating overtime are close to being concluded. I am hopeful that an agreement will be finalised shortly and that staff will ballot for acceptance.</P>

	<P>Funding is currently made available to a number of community policing fora which have arisen in the context of the Government&rsquo;s national drugs strategy. There are two such fora operating on a pilot basis under the <Col N="1128"/>aegis of the local drugs task forces in the north inner-city and in Finglas and Cabra. The north inner-city community policing fora was established in 1999 and currently operates in Dublin&rsquo;s north-east inner-city area. This project receives annual funding of &euro;72,950 through the local drugs task force initiative. In addition, the north inner-city task force initiated an additional pilot project in 2004 which involves extending the work of the original policing fora within the wider task force area. This project extension currently receives annual funding of &euro;64,198.</P>
        <P>A community policing forum under the aegis of the local drugs task force in Finglas and Cabra was established as a pilot initiative in 2003. This project also receives annual funding of &euro;50,790 through the local drugs task force initiative. In all of these cases, funding is provided in respect of staff and programme costs which would include raising the awareness of the fora within their local communities. The growth of community policing fora in general needs to be delivered in the context of the development of an appropriate policy framework for what are relatively new partnership structures involving the garda&iacute;, local authorities and local communities. Such a framework will ensure that such fora can be appropriately developed in a consistent and properly planned manner rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which they have tended to emerge in a number of different contexts to date. Work is well under way on the development of such a policy framework which will facilitate progress in this area.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 represents the most significant legislative reform of Garda structures since the foundation of the State. Included in its draft provisions are mechanisms for enhanced co-operation between the garda&iacute; and local authorities through the establishment, on a statutory basis, of policing committees. It is intended that such committees will act as fora where matters relating to all aspects of policing can be discussed and where strategies and recommendations for dealing with issues arising locally can be decided. It is intended that these policing committees will facilitate the establishment of local policing fora to address specific issues in local areas.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that Cabra Garda station is the primary Garda station for the Cabra area. The Bridewell and Mountjoy Garda stations provide personnel for adjoining areas. The personnel strength of Cabra Garda station on 15 December 2004 was 64, across all ranks. The personnel strength of the Bridewell and Mountjoy Garda stations at the same date was 167 and 91, respectively.</P>
        <P>There are two community garda&iacute; with specific responsibility for the areas of Cabra west, Dunard estate and the various housing estates off the Navan Road. The personnel strength of the community policing units attached to the Bridewell and Mountjoy Garda stations on 15 December 2004 was 14, across all ranks in both stations. Two community garda&iacute; attached to the Bridewell Garda station have responsibility for and are assigned to the Cabra area of the district, which includes Annamoe, Old Cabra Road and McKee Park. Two community garda&iacute; attached to the Mountjoy Garda station have responsibility for and are assigned to the Cabra area of the district, which includes St. Attracta Road and Christ the King Church.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased to note that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Cabra area will be fully considered within the context of policing needs throughout the country. The additional resources will clearly be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the <Col N="1131"/>number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. The additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline operational, high-visibility policing and they will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>The provision of broadband to schools is a central element of my Department&rsquo;s strategy for advancing ICT as a teaching and learning resource in first and second level education.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the Government reached agreement with the telecommunications sector on a major investment project which will see broadband connectivity delivered to all schools by the end of 2005. A three year fund of &euro;18 million is being established for this purpose, with industry providing &euro;5 million per annum and the Government providing &euro;1 million per annum. Tenders for the provision of broadband to schools are currently being evaluated by a team of experts appointed by my Department and it is the intention to award contracts shortly with a view to <Col N="1133"/>commencing roll out of service to schools in the new year.</P>
        <P>Additional Exchequer funding is being provided for the development of a secure national broadband network for schools managed centrally by HEAnet and a services help desk, managed by the national centre for technology in education, providing advice and support to schools on technical issues with broadband connectivity. Both the national network and the help desk are currently being developed and will be operational in the new year to support the roll out of broadband service to schools.</P>
        <P>I also recently announced a new &euro;18 million funding package for schools which will enable them to upgrade and augment their computer network facilities in advance of broadband roll out next year. This &euro;18 million funding for computer networks, which is being paid to schools this month, is additional to the &euro;18 million being provided for broadband connectivity through the industry and Government fund.</P>

	<P>The school in question currently has the services of two full-time resource teachers, one part-time resource teacher and two full-time learning support teachers. One of the learning <Col N="1134"/>support teaching posts was originally sanctioned on the basis of a sharing arrangement with another school. Following a reorganisation of the shared learning support cluster in October 2004, it was decided to allocate the second learning support teaching post to the school on a full-time basis.</P>
        <P>The appropriate level of resource teaching support in the school will be addressed in the context of the proposed new system of allocation of resource teaching support in primary schools. The proposed system involves a general allocation to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise with this model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with representative interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year.</P>
        <P>Individual applications may continue to be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year a new planning model was introduced for educational infrastructure to ensure that school provision is decided after a transparent consultation process. Trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. The main feature of the new model, which is being introduced initially on a pilot basis in five specific areas, is the publication of an area development plan which sets out a blueprint for education infrastructure in a particular area into the future. The components of a draft area development plan are details of existing primary and post primary provision, an examination of local demographics, a commentary on relevant data and recommendations on future provision. On publication of each draft area development plan, the commission on school accommodation conducts a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions are published. The process in each case culminates in the publication of a final area development plan against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.</P>
        <P>The final area development plan for Mountmellick and Mountrath has been published and the final area development plan for the area around the N4 from Leixlip through Kilcock, Enfield, Longwood, Kinnegad and Rochfortbridge to Kilbeggan is being completed. A further three draft area development plans will be published by the middle of next year. The location of the proposed new school to which the Deputy refers is being considered as part of the process outlined above.</P>

        <P LI="1">3. The payment of the first and second phase of the increases recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the 3% increase are dependent, in the case of each organisation and grade, on verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the Sustaining Progress agreement. <i>The Secretary General in consultation with the Education Sector Performance Verification Group (ESPVG) has considered progress achieved</i> and decided that the level of progress achieved during the period warrants the payment of the relevant pay increases.</P>

The final payment of Benchmarking increases and future payments under Sustaining Progress are dependent, in the case of each organisation and grade, on verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by Sustaining Progress. Payment is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement of targets to be achieved in relation to ongoing change and flexibility.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that no final decision has been made on the future of the school to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department have been in correspondence with the patron and management authority of the school regarding the possible amalgamation of this school with two other schools in the area. Discussions are ongoing locally between the patron, the board and the school community about the issue of amalgamation. The final decision rests with the patron, subject only to my approval.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the escalation in the cost of insurance for schools in Dublin in recent years; if she has developed an index of the costs of care and maintenance of second level schools; and her estimate of the increase in such costs in recent years and of the current cost per pupil.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the costs of insurance in individual secondary schools as it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. However, I am aware of the concerns expressed by school authorities, including those in Dublin, in relation to increased insurance costs.</P>
        <P>Grant aid to voluntary secondary schools is provided by my Department by way of per capita grants and may be used towards insurance as well as care and maintenance costs.</P>
        <P>The benefit of developing an index of the costs of care and maintenance and the associated cost per pupil is not clear. The amount expended by schools on such items is a matter for school managements and will vary depending on the priority accorded by each school in accordance with its own needs.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. I was particularly pleased to announce an aggregate increase of &euro;26 per pupil from January next in the standard per capita grant and support services grant for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional funding since 1997 of up to &euro;119,000 per annum and annual grants of &euro;255,761, &euro;275,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in general, a preferable <Col N="1142"/>approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items.</P>
        <P>Schools have welcomed this announcement. These significant increases in the funding of secondary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>Potential officers courses, POC, are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. <Col N="1144"/>In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks, CFR, competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system, IPMS, which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence and in the programme for Government. The IPMS will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
        <P>Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on any of the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the intention that a potential officers course will be run as soon as these discussions are completed.</P>

During the run-up to the finalisation and launch of the national spatial strategy in November 2002, it was decided that the communi<Col N="1146"/>cations campaign supporting the strategy should be intensified considerably and the communications consultant was actively involved in this work. This consultant&rsquo;s involvement in the NSS project, which began at this time, was undertaken under the general terms of the relevant contract with the Department.

	<P>The particulars to be provided in a tenancy registration application are prescribed in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. I am satisfied that the requirements are reasonable and appropriate for the operation of this recently enacted legislation and it is not proposed to amend the relevant section of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Private Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s registration database will be of key importance to the operation of its dispute resolution service, especially in relation to disputes over rents in excess of market levels, tenancy terminations and notice periods. It will also be an important source of information to the board in the performance of its statutory functions of providing information, research and policy advice on the private rented sector. Up to date information is essential for the development of informed policy on this segment of the housing market. The registration data collected by the board will, for example, enable the board to identify the size of the market, the type <Col N="1151"/>of dwellings and rent levels and trends for different dwellings and locations.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the escalation of problems associated with the operation of private gated estates in respect of uncontrolled management charges and the unreliability of management companies generally; if he has plans to introduce legislation to address these problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Such management companies are constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of those Acts. The operation of such companies is primarily a matter for their members, which are the owners of the properties in the developments to which they relate. The agreed programme for Government undertook to consider the introduction of legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies and a Law Reform Commission working group is examining the law on condominiums and issues relating to management companies. As part of its work, the group is considering consumer protection issues, including management company service charges. The group intends to produce a consultation paper early next year. This should provide a basis for considering measures and how they should be pursued.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2004 policy statement, Waste Management: Taking Stock and Moving Forward, indicated the intention to move in 2005 to a weight-volume-based system of waste charges on a national basis. It is a matter for the local authorities, whether as direct service providers or waste collection permitting authorities, to oversee this transition to weight-volume-based charging. Service providers will be allowed discretion as to the precise systems to be used, provided that the fundamental principle of use-based charging is respected. My Department does not, therefore, intend to issue detailed guidance on the precise arrangements to be applied locally in regard to this matter.</P>
