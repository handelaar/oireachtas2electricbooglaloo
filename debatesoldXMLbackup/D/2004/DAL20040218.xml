    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the House witnessed a partial climb-down by the Government in respect of electronic voting. I wish to give the Taoiseach the opportunity to outline how the independent panel will operate. How will the panel be appointed? What powers will it have? Will it be able to deal with the issue raised by Deputy Allen on a number of occasions in respect of a verifiable audit trail? If it recommends this to Government, will the Government implement it before the local and European elections on 11 June? What are the implications for the panel of the necessity to train 15,000 staff in the new procedures? Is the Taoiseach aware that in January 2003, a senior official in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said that the roll-out of this programme nationwide would be both risky and, perhaps, unmanageable? Will he also comment on how the contract for the advertising and management of the electronic voting programme was awarded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said yesterday that one of the most important fundamental rights in a democracy is the right to vote in a secret ballot. Everything we have done over the past five years in preparation for this system, including the pilot system and the authentic examinations by both international and local bodies, has been to ensure that this right is vindicated. The electorate must have confidence in the voting system so the steps we took yesterday were an attempt to take account of what Members of the House and others have said, even though they are not constitutionally or legally necessary. We believe we should ensure that people see the success of the system.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of a voter verified paper audit trail, there have been calls for a paper system to parallel the electronic voting system. This arises out of some experiences in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is total rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="458"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Irish system's reliability for accurately recording votes cast has been tested and verified by an internationally accredited testing institute in Berlin. Other countries have also accepted the reliability and accuracy of the vote, including Holland, Germany and France, without the need for a voter audit trail. Deputy Kenny sought some detail on this issue. The US voting machines in question are generally PC based. The Nedap voting machine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody mentioned the USA. That is misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is a proprietary product manufactured specifically for voting. Only the counting system will be PC based. The Nedap machine has been used for many years in other countries without any uncertainty as to its reliability. The machine, including the software for storing votes, has been tested and certified and accurately stores votes cast by the voters.</P>
      <P>The ballot paper is visible on the voting machine system. Printers are unreliable in a high volume situation and that is the reason they are not used. The ballot papers printed at the time of voting and used in a manual count might not give the same precise results as the electronic voting system. We either opt for electronic voting or stay with the old system. There is no point having a dual system. That is like keeping the punt and the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The machines were ordered before the decision was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One does not keep two systems. It is a nonsensical argument. Deputy Kenny asked about the tender system. That was an open and transparent process using the same rules that apply to all tendering processes. The rules have been followed in full.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the independent group. The Government accepts without qualification the necessity for and desirability of complete confidence in our electoral process. Electronic voting is a modern mechanism for the expression of the voter's preference and it is not in the interests of either the Government or the Opposition to have a voting system that is not perceived to be fair and transparent. The Government is satisfied that the electronic voting system that is required will provide the necessary secrecy and accuracy and, in this regard, is prepared to establish a group that will have complete independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Who will appoint the members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be appointed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is reassuring.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="459"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be people of high standing to deal with this issue. That will be provided for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If all is as the Taoiseach says, why is there a necessity for change? It is the fear of the Government in the face of the motion put down by the combined Opposition. Last Friday, the Taoiseach said on the Gerry Ryan radio programme that the Government has changed the culture of the system and has installed tough controls and passed tough legislation. He said people are now accountable and are scrutinised to an extraordinary extent and that this might be a little over bureaucratic but it had to be done.</P>
      <P>He says the tendering system is open and transparent so let us apply last Friday's test to that remark. The previous budget given to a company for the roll out of the pilot programme was &euro;80,000. The tender in this case was for &euro;4.5 million. The person who allocated this was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a Fianna F&aacute;il appointee who happens to be the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's director of elections. Is it true that his personally appointed political adviser, Monica Leech, sat on the interview board which awarded this tender to a company which had only been in existence for nine months and whose principal personality is the former Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary? How can we have trust in the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Where now stands the fully open and transparent tender system with regard to this contract of public money to the extent of &euro;4.5 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to conclude as his minute is long concluded. As the Deputy knows, last week Members raised the question of fair play in the timing for Leaders' Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government cannot be trusted. I want the Taoiseach to explain to the House how a politically appointed adviser sat on the final interview board for the awarding of a tender of &euro;4.5 million of public money. The Government cannot be trusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny also made an allegation against a person outside this House who is not in a position to defend herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not. I asked the Taoiseach to confirm whether or not that person sat on the interview board. I did not make an allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be serious about electronic voting and to talk about independent verification in Germany and Holland. However, what this is really about is people trying to stir around a small issue.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="460"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not voting in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a serious question. He asked why it was &euro;80,000 the first time and then &euro;4.5 million. The first &euro;80,000 was for three constituencies. It is slightly more costly to do the 42 constituencies. That is the reason. The contracts were put out in the proper way under a transparent system which has already been explained by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. I am sure he would be glad to explain it in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>He never explained it. We got the information under freedom of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be glad to put the system of tendering into the public domain and to get somebody to explain it. Deputy Kenny said we changed our position because of the Opposition motion. Points were made by a number of Deputies over a number of weeks about this issue. As I have stated time and again, I have been advised both legally and constitutionally, as has the Minister and the previous Minister, that there is no need to change this. The right to vote is a fundamental right of a democracy and we must take account of that. When I hear valid points made here or elsewhere &mdash; I have read a number of articles and editorials which made valid points &mdash; I try to ensure we are sure. That is a fair position to take and we have taken that into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>What about an answer to the questions of who was on the interview panel or who got the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The High Court stated recently that in the principle of legislation, matters should be set out not just in secondary but in primary legislation. It made that statement in regard to the McCreevy case which concerns Carrickmines. It seems like the Government's position that we should follow good practice. The Government has tried throughout the five years of this, from the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, to do things correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another attempt to hoodwink the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made reference to the decision on Carrickmines. Will he comment on the different conclusion over the weekend which also affects the holding up of the M50 motorway and the added punishment for the hard-pressed motorist? I refer to the decision by a group of individuals to go to court to delay the M50 while they asserted ownership to lands adjacent to the motorway. They claimed &euro;118 million in compensation. After various revelations at Dublin Castle they reduced this to &euro;48 million. In the event, they were awarded &euro;13 million of our money. This is a company called <Col N="461"/>Jackson Way, through which three prominent individuals, an arcade owner, Mr. Jim Kennedy, a solicitor, Mr. John Caldwell and a former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and chairman of the Fianna F&aacute;il ethics committee, Liam Lawlor, asserted ownership to this land and were awarded &euro;13 million.</P>
      <P>The tribunal has established that this company has no legal title to the lands in question, yet these people who asserted a claim for &euro;118 million were awarded &euro;13 million of our money. One would not find this situation in the Yukon in the 19th century. There, one would not find someone mounting a claim jump such as this. Will the Taoiseach confirm that no money will be paid out? Will he say what action the State proposes to take to seize the lands in question? Will any prosecution be mounted against those who falsely asserted ownership, obstructed the building of the road, cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and had the cheek to press it to the point where they were awarded &euro;13 million of taxpayer&rsquo;s money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My answer to this must necessarily be short. The matters have been fought out in the courts. As Deputy Rabbitte said there is a question of ownership and the proving of the case they put. The courts have made the decision on it. The Government will have to examine the judgment of the court. That examination is under way. As in all cases, I cannot see how the Government will be able to take any position other than that found in a court of law. We will have to examine that to see what rights of redress or what other protections we have. We do not own the land and that is the difficulty for us. If the courts have made a determination on this, we may well have to pay. We will examine the judgment and then make a decision on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a bit surprised that the Taoiseach is not better briefed on this. This was not a decision of the court but of the arbitrator. It was not a decision of the court to award &euro;13 million of our money to these people. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, for example, announced after the first Flood report that the Government would introduce a corruption assets bureau. That seems to have fallen off the legislative schedule. That corruption assets bureau, as announced by Deputy Hanafin, would have enabled us now to seize these lands.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach appears to be saying that there is still a question mark over whether we will go ahead and pay out the money. People watching this will react with disbelief that when people who assert ownership of land they did not have and con the arbitrator into getting &euro;13 million of our money, it would be paid out. We can adjourn for the Cabinet to discuss this, a Cheann Comhairle, but with all due respect I would have thought it was such a grave matter that it ought to have been discussed before I raised it this morning.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="462"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My information, and I have just consulted with colleagues, is that the ownership case was before the courts. That is either right or not. Deputy Rabbitte says the ownership case was not before the courts. My colleagues believe it was. The arbitrator made his judgment based on what happened in the courts. The matter is also before the tribunals but that is not the issue. The Government will not pay out money lightly. We will base it on our legal opinion and on the judgment of what happened in the court where it was an effort to find ownership or on what the arbitrator said. The matter is also before the tribunal and perhaps we may deal with the issue. The point of disagreement between us seems to be whether or not the decision on the land was decided in the courts. I will have to check that. As I understand it, that decision was made in the courts and the arbitrator made a judgment. The issue for us now is to decide whether to pay out. If the issue of ownership is not proved, the Government will not pay out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up an issue raised with the Minister for Finance by my colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan and pursued by Deputy Boyle. Yesterday the Minister made some remarkable revelations. He changed the Irish tax code, as he said, to level the playing pitch in favour of a bid for Eircom by Valentia. Does the Taoiseach consider it proper practice for a Minister for Finance to intervene in a bidding war between two large private companies for one of the State's most important assets? That particular Act is estimated to have ultimately cost the taxpayer about &euro;50 million.</P>
      <P>Were the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet informed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, of this decision prior to his agreeing to the amendment of tax law in this case? Is the Taoiseach aware of what involvement the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, had? She was the Minister responsible for telecommunications at the time. Did the Government have any strategic thoughts on the development of telecommunications? For example, was it policy to get venture capitalists to operate telecommunications?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider this sweetheart deal was fair to the 550,000 ordinary shareholders who were taken in by television advertisements about what a good deal this would be, who were forced to sell their own shareholdings at a loss due to the deal the Government helped arrange? The takeover panel, for example, certainly had concerns.</P>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach say to the likes of a caller we had this morning, Mr. Edward Moran, of Belmullet in Mayo, who took a court case at the time to maintain his shareholding rights against the back room deal that the Government, the unions and the Valentia consortium had cooked up?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think there is an important issue to answer on how taxpayers were <Col N="463"/>defrauded of money and how, in this case, one private company was helped by the Government against another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked if amendments to the Finance Bill come before Government. Yes, they do and the Minister for Finance clears them with Government. The Minister for Finance has made numerous changes to the ESOT legislation to facilitate the ESOTs in changing circumstances to ensure they retain the benefits available to them. This is because of their nature; ESOTs are tailor-made to particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the particular case raised by Deputy Sargent, I understand that the ESOT workers lobbied for this change. Section 13 of the Finance Act 2002 provided that the transfer and appropriation of securities, other than ordinary shares, to the beneficiaries of the ESOT APSS in the circumstances of certain takeovers, may take place in a manner which preserves the tax benefits to the participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>How did the half million other shareholders lobby the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ryan is not the leader of his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be noted that the legislation contained in section 13 does no more than preserve the existing tax benefits to the beneficiaries of an ESOT in the event of such a takeover and provides no further tax advantage beyond that. It did not change the position.</P>
      <P>Two takeovers were in a position to take immediate advantage of these legislative changes. The first was the takeover of the landline business of Eircom by the Valentia consortium and the second was the takeover of ACC Bank by Rabobank. The background to this in June 2001 was that the ESOT's tax advisers contacted the Department of Finance on behalf of the workers as they wished to discuss the tax implication for Eircom's ESOT of the proposed takeover of Eircom. Having considered the issues involved, the Minister indicated the following June that he was prepared to propose an amendment and this was duly done the following year in the Finance Act 2002. This was made known in the Minister for Finance's response to the D&aacute;il question by the then finance spokesperson of the Labour Party, Senator McDowell, on 14 November 2001. The provision in section 13 simply provided the membership of Eircom's ESOT with a level playing field to choose to support whichever bid they wished.</P>
      <P>All the relevant papers described in the media in the last few days were released by the Department under the Freedom of Information Act. The decision to release the papers was made by the Department on 6 December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="464"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incredible to hear the Taoiseach say there was no change. It is clear there was a significant change. What public interest was served by that change in the tax code? The answer has to be, none. The union was effectively acting for Valentia in this case. The Taoiseach refers to &ldquo;the workers&rdquo;, as if these were ordinary people, the reality is that the 550,000 shareholders were at a considerable loss and that remains the case.</P>
      <P>On 9 October, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, announced another ESOP arrangement, the Air Lingus ESOP, by stating it was Government policy that the full 14.9% union stake is only given out in circumstances such as when the State is exiting from the company. It is a valid question to ask if the real purpose of these ESOPs is to get privatisation through at any cost. It is effectively a pay-off, a sweetener. Is this not a classic example of what the <i>Irish Independent</i> calls pay-back time culture that characterises this sleazy Administration? Is that not the real policy here &mdash; that this is a sweetener deal to try and buy off workers for privatisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent should withdraw a comment like that. It does not merit him making an allegation like that, but I will not get myself too excited about it. The question of cost here is totally hypothetical. Any sensible person would ask if it is conceivable that an ESOT would have agreed to any takeover from whatever source if it involved the ESOT losing the tax relief available to it. That is the question, which is why the advisers did it. The answer is that they would not. Deputy Sargent would not do so either, nor would anybody else. Certainly an adviser to a trade union would not do it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent has made a comment that does not usually come from him; obviously someone has wound him up to ask this. The Minister for Finance in this Administration did not introduce this ESOT, it was done by a previous Administration and by a previous Minister for Finance who is not a member of either Government party.</P>

	<P>Leopards do not change their spots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not introduced by either a Fianna F&aacute;il or Progressive Democrats Minister. There is nothing wrong with it whatsoever. It was actually brought in by a Labour Party Minister for Finance, but it is absolutely in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent referred to &ldquo;this sleazy Administration&rdquo;. There is nothing whatever wrong with it. The Deputy will probably say now that it is fine, but there is nothing wrong with it. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Deputy Sargent should withdraw that comment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach comment on remarks made recently by the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, to the effect that the Lansdowne Road decision resulted, in part, from information derived under the Freedom of Information Act? She appeared to say that the extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, as the Chair has pointed out for many years, these questions refer specifically to freedom of information requests processed by the Taoiseach's Department. The Freedom of Information Act is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When we were looking for statistics on the second half of 2003 on the fall-off in freedom of information requests, we were able to find statistics from almost every Department but not the Department of the Taoiseach. Can the Taoiseach indicate if the trend is borne out in his Department? We have seen the number of requests falling in the period July-December 2003 compared to the same period in the previous year. Requests are down by 70% in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and 60% in the Department of Health and Children. In the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, as I pointed out to Deputy Kenny&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to elicit information from the Taoiseach's Department. Is this trend borne out in his Department as in other Departments? Requests in the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and Foreign Affairs have decreased by 70%, and by 60% in the Department of Finance. Is there a similar decrease in the Department of the Taoiseach and is this directly related to the increased charges put on ordinary people seeking information to which they are entitled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I looked at the figures for my Department over the weekend. In the first year or 18 months after the Act was introduced, my Department received an enormous number of requests, many of which went back over many years when such a facility was not available. Information sought by individuals in a personal capacity generated many such requests. This substantially died down after the initial period and has continued to do so.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>There have been a number of changes. In the early days, staff requests for information went through the FOI system. They no longer have to do this as their files are available to them without going through the FOI system. Many requests were from staff in the Department wishing to see what their superiors or anyone else was saying about them. They can now get their files which has led to a reduction in the baseline number. Those seeking personal files do not have to pay a fee or an appeal fee and the people concerned are not affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this refer to people seeking personal information?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it refers to any kind of personal facts.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o'clock</TimeSt><P>There have been changes since the fee was introduced. The intention always was that a fee would be introduced. However, this was left out in the early part of the operation of the Act to allow the system to settle down. In the figures for my Department, the category of business requests has dropped from six to two, Oireachtas requests have dropped from two to one, and other requests have dropped from 23 to 21. The only really significant drop has been in requests from journalists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a direct relationship between the fee charging regime introduced by the Government and the decline in the number of applications made under the Act? Does he accept that the effect of this is to impede public debate on matters of public interest? Does he accept the example given by the Information Commissioner regarding a project that started life in his Department, namely, the Abbotstown stadium?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already ruled Deputy Kenny out of order on this. This question refers specifically to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As did the Abbotstown stadium at the time. The view of the Information Commissioner is that the decision to locate at Lansdowne Road is at least partly due to the information secured under the Freedom of Information Act. Does the Taoiseach accept this? Does he accept that there are potentially several other projects and matters of public interest where applications will not be pursued under the <Col N="469"/>Freedom of Information Act because of the fee-charging regime introduced by the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not accept this. On a major project, or even a small project, a fee of &euro;15 will hardly deter anyone from looking into any matter seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Chair explain why he changed precedent in the order of taking the questions as they appear on the Order Paper? I have no difficulty with Deputy Rabbitte speaking before me. I am more concerned about the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair apologises to the Deputy; the Chair should have called you in advance of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My comment was for the Chair and not Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
        <P>The Information Commissioner, Emily O'Reilly, has recently highlighted the international experience where increases in fees or the introduction of fees for FOI requests have led to a direct effect on the number of requests proffered. Does the Taoiseach accept the veracity in the Information Commissioner's opinion that the drop in the number of requests to the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments is as a direct result of the fees now applying? This is another example of access to information becoming more the preserve of those who can afford to pay for it rather than those who cannot afford it. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is a mistake to apply or increase fees and that access to information is a basic and fundamental right that should be restored? What is the Taoiseach's opinion on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is more appropriate to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, you are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a direct correlation between the drop in the number of requests for information to the Department of the Taoiseach and the fees now applying? Furthermore, in previous responses in the House, the Taoiseach indicated the introduction of the fee was a response to what he described as nuisance requests. We must recognise that built within the legislation is provision to safeguard the system from what are described in the legislation as &ldquo;frivolous or vexatious&rdquo; requests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="470"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt><?oasys _fc?>
	<P>I am particularly interested in the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer this in the context of my Department's experience. I do not accept the argument Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is making. If one wants personal files or data from my Department, one does not pay a fee. If one wants to trawl general issues &mdash; which a small minority of people did &mdash; the Department incurs a cost. I was involved in discussions on this issue some time ago but I will not go into that. It was decided that there should be a fee structure for FOI requests. I believe it was overdue and a better balance needed to be struck between the burden and the costs of administering the FOI Act. In many cases within my Department, this administration is quite costly and significant. While allowing people to have access to information is a right, there must be a sensible and balanced system of charges.</P>
        <P>The charge of &euro;15 to find something of a serious nature has discouraged people from making frivolous and vexatious inquiries to my Department. People making such requests have done what anyone will do when they have to pay for it and rather than submitting ten requests, they streamline them into a single request. They still get the information and I cannot see how a &euro;15 fee would put off anybody. We looked at the appeals systems in Australia and New Zealand and we also followed their fee structures.</P>
        <P>There were arguments about the deliberative process in my Department and that the Secretary General would be needed under sections 19 and 20. This regime has been in place for a year and we have not had a single case of this. I do not think the arguments are sustained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions 8 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The programme for my visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day has yet to be finalised. However, I expect to arrive in Washington on Tuesday, 16 March and attend the gala dinner of the American Ireland Fund that evening. On Wednesday, St. Patrick's Day, I expect to participate in the traditional ceremonies at the White House and on Capitol Hill. I will depart Washington for the EU-Canada summit in Ottawa on Thursday, 18 March.</P>
        <P>I have invited the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board to visit Ireland this year. A programme is currently being developed for a visit scheduled for September. As usual, I keep in touch with members of the advisory board as the need arises and meet them on their visits here when possible. I met Ambassador Richard Haass's successor, Dr. Mitchell Reiss, President Bush's policy adviser on Northern Ireland, on Wednesday, 4 February and briefed him on my recent contacts and on the review. Dr. Reiss also met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and had meetings in Belfast and London in the course of his visit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Have arrangements been finalised for a visit by the US President to Ireland? There have been reports that he is due to visit some time in May or June. If that happens, does the Taoiseach consider that transatlantic relationships between the EU and North America might be something that Ireland could lead on during its Presidency, given that the EU and United States are our most important trading partners for goods and services? There are serious differences of opinion between elements in Europe and the United States regarding the war on Iraq, GM foods, changes in the <Col N="472"/>International Criminal Court and other matters which have caused great tension between the European Union and the United States.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell launched a document proposing a transatlantic foundation which could be sited in Ireland. Will the Taoiseach give consideration to that kind of concept or proposal, which would go a long way to healing the rift that exists between the European Union and the United States in several areas? Will he take the opportunity to discuss that matter with the US President when he comes here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The visit is in the context of a European Union-US summit, and the entire agenda will consist of EU business. Possible dates and locations are being considered, but no more than that. However, it is intended that the summit take place in Ireland, either in the second half of May or, more likely, in June. I hope to try to finalise that during the visit to Washington on St. Patrick's Day, if not before.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny is right that it is important to move on from the difficulties of last year, and we can play a constructive role. In the autumn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, put forward a paper on the constructive role that we could play in the EU context in trying to improve relationships. It was very well received by the General Affairs Council. There are two aspects to it, the first being trying to look at issues where we believe that the European Union and the United States do not have conflicting roles and on which we can co-operate, for example, concerning the Middle East road map, UN policy on Iraq, the ongoing difficulties in Syria and Iran, the Korean problem, and the peacekeeping role that the UN can play and how the US can feed into that. Those are areas where there are no differences with the EU. We have put forward a coherent argument in those cases.</P>
        <P>The second part is that raised by Deputy Kenny &mdash; the ability to build up trade and continue trying to get back to the next round of the WTO talks. We are a considerable trading nation, but the relationship with the US is of enormous importance for the whole of Europe. I will examine what Deputy Gay Mitchell has said, but from an article I read, I believe it concerned international trade and areas which we should centralise. Those are pertinent areas with which I agree, since there is huge capacity for trade. The United States' current position shows it striving ahead and there are arguments as to whether that is sustainable. There are many opportunities for Europe, and we will be addressing that at the spring Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>At the Taoiseach's meeting with President Bush, either in Washington or when the President comes here for the EU-US summit, will he take the opportunity to get more accurate information regarding what knowledge was available from UN weapons inspectors before the Iraq war regarding weapons of mass destruction, <Col N="473"/>which seems to have been far more accurate than information from western intelligence sources, either in the US or Britain? Was the Government given information, from either the British or US Governments, about the extent or otherwise of these weapons in Iraq?</P>
        <P>Has any information been made available to the Taoiseach in his capacity as President of the European Union that, for instance, drug production in Afghanistan has risen by practically 1,000%? Most of that finds its way onto the streets of Europe, and something should be done about it. The Taliban are gone &mdash; the invasion dealt with that &mdash; but the consequences appear to be horrendous in social problems, extortion and the destruction of hundreds of thousands of young European lives as a consequence of the drug trade and production capacity having escalated seriously. Will the Taoiseach take up those matters with President Bush when he meets him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second issue was very important, but I will first reply on the question regarding weapons of mass destruction. Whatever happened in the end, Deputy Kenny has raised an important matter. Our approach to the issue and all that we said at the time in support of the UN line in the months leading up to the war, right back to 2002, was based on Security Council resolutions dating from 1991, in which the Security Council stated that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That had never been denied, but now it is proper to say that they were never there. That was not the case, however, and in all those resolutions the Security Council was absolutely satisfied of the position. When Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted, the Security Council was acting in the belief that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction, and that belief was widely shared in the international community. The General Affairs Council, when it met in November 2002, could not have been more clear when it stated its belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. That was in spite of there being disagreement among member states about how to deal with the situation. However, there was no argument about whether there were weapons.</P>
        <P>In the report &mdash; one of the last &mdash; issued to the Security Council in March 2003, Dr. Blix, who was the head of UNMOVIC, said that the arms inspection team mandated to investigate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had said that many questions relating to them remained unanswered. He had spent the previous seven months trying to get those answers. Regardless of whether those weapons still existed when he made that statement or when the war was about to start, Iraq was in material breach of its disarmament obligations to Dr. Blix and his colleagues and had failed to co-operate fully with the arms inspectors carrying out their mandate to verify that Iraq no longer had weapons of mass destruction.</P><Col N="474"/>
        <P>The Irish position on Iraq remains one of support for the role of the UN. We will continue in our work, and not a week goes by without our having contact with Secretary General Annan regarding his efforts to maximise, within the existing political and physical constraints, the role and activities of the United Nations in Iraq. During our Presidency we will continue to support efforts aimed at reaching an international consensus and a way forward.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy's second question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will be in Afghanistan this week as part of the Presidency. I have read the prepared documents and, regardless of the percentages, which I cannot recall, the Deputy is correct. The only policy of the Taliban which I regarded as useful was their anti-drugs policy. Last year, the growing of opium crops recommenced and has reached an all-time high. There is no doubt that these crops will turn into drugs on our streets, as happened last year, and quantities are bound to increase around the world. The Minister will raise that issue.</P>
        <P>It is no good for me or the Deputy to state in the House that the growing of such crops should stop. A way must be found to help the people involved or subsidise them to grow other crops. From what I have read recently, they do not get much money from them. The world community, if it really wants to stop the trade, and everybody agrees we do, must find a way of giving them aid and assistance to get them to move to alternative ways of making a living. The people involved live among bushes and rocks so they do not make much money out of their crops; others do.</P>
        <P>This is an enormously important issue and I am sure the Minister will report to the House on his meetings this week in Afghanistan, where he will have an opportunity to meet Mr. Karzai and others. I know they are trying but I understand that their powers are still limited to Kabul and they have not managed to regain much ground in the hinterlands to which many of the warlords have returned. We will receive a report on this major issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach discuss electronic voting with President Bush?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He would not be in favour of electronic voting. He would, however, favour the machine version which would probably receive support in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it not be a good idea to have an international representative on the panel of experts to be established by the Taoiseach? If Jeb Bush is available, he may agree to chair it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He would have to obtain a work permit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We could arrange one for him. On the serious question Deputy Kenny raises, is it not the case that relations between the <Col N="475"/>European Union and the United States have been damaged as a result of the Iraq adventure and that, arising from that war, the world is now a less safe place, anti-Americanism is being fuelled and Iraq now has a domestic terrorist dimension it did not have previously?</P>
        <P>What is the point in raising again the question of whether there were weapons of mass destruction at the time war was declared? Even President Bush admits the intelligence was faulty. In those circumstances, would it not be appropriate, during the St. Patrick's Day discussions, for the Taoiseach, whether in his capacity as leader of the Government or as President of the European Union, to register the serious disquiet in this and other democracies, including Mr. Blair's, about the Iraq adventure, and that this point be made to Mr. Bush, on behalf of a friendly country and a friendly European Union, by somebody such as the Taoiseach who continues to state that his position and that of his Government was anti-war?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty agreeing with Deputy Rabbitte that the point should be made. Whatever about the situation earlier, the situation in the end was that the information was not good. That is the reason Britain has responded and, to reply to the Deputy's question on America, the Bush Administration has decided to create an independent commission.</P>
        <P>Last spring, towards the end of the war, I had an opportunity in Hillsborough to make the point that there was enormous concern in Europe and people were unhappy that the UN position was not followed through. The Irish position, which was to stick with the UN, was not adopted and people moved on and did not seek a further resolution. I believed then that this was regrettable and that position has not changed.</P>
        <P>As I stated previously in the House, I will ask about the information. Last March, on St. Patrick's Day, the Americans were convinced, as was Prime Minister Blair, that they were right on this issue but events proved that this was not the case. I will make those points because I think they are important. I will also make the point that, the more I deal with EU business, the more I see that, if the Americans were to engage more intensely in the Middle East, it would be a huge factor in stabilising the situation. I am not sure why everyone cannot see this because the problem feeds into so many other difficulties. The Middle East is not just Palestine but all the other areas in the region.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the argument that the Middle East can be ignored because it is election year in America. Not everyone in America is tied up in the election and I do not accept that as an excuse, even though I keep hearing it. I have had the opportunity of meeting the Israeli Foreign Minister and will meet him again next week when I will make the point that it is not in the interests <Col N="476"/>of Israel, Palestine or anywhere else that the current position continue.</P>
        <P>The fundamental question on Iraq, which we have been stating in recent days to Colin Powell and others, is how to transfer power to a sovereign Iraqi Government at a time when the country is torn by violence by the main factions, the Shia, the Sunni and the Kurds. There is so much disagreement on the way forward. The kind of death toll we have seen in the past week and the violence between the factions and against the Americans cannot continue.</P>
        <P>The US has been pressing for the UN to carry out its electoral mission and there is a sense of relief everywhere, including in the US Administration, that this has now been agreed. That Administration is anxious to get UN involvement and it is important that we see more of it. Otherwise the major difficulties and the many killings will not be resolved. It is far better that the UN will become more involved but we need to see the transfer of power. The difficulty is that this is not easy because there is total disagreement between the main factions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach indicate the tenor of the matters he will raise with President Bush and whether he believes there may be a positive outcome of the new emphasis on fighting terrorism in the United States? Does he believe the American Administration is likely to be a helpful influence in dealing with the outstanding disarmament question in Northern Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally the St. Patrick's Day visit and meetings are focused almost entirely on Northern Ireland. This will be slightly different this year because of the EU business but the main focus will continue to be on Northern Ireland issues. Obviously, they will include an update on the work on the review and the position papers arising from it.</P>
        <P>Having dealt with Northern Ireland for so many years, the last thing I would ever want to be is simplistic on the issue. For the first time in many years the solution is straightforward. I remember the time when there were 72 items on the agenda for meetings with the then Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and we used to wonder how we would get through them. It is now fairly clear. Whatever happens in the process review if we get to a position where there is a total cessation of all paramilitary activities on one side &mdash; that is spelled out in detail and contained in one paragraph &mdash; then I believe there is a compelling case for everybody, including the Democratic Unionist Party, to move on with power sharing in the institutions, principles of consent and so on. The more I look at it the more I believe that is what it is down to. Equally if that is not done, I do not see how it can be resolved.</P>
        <P>For the first time in a long time it is a clear-cut position. If we see that everybody is determined to see the end of paramilitarism and everybody is <Col N="477"/>determination to achieve that, and we are as near to it as we have ever been, then there is a compelling responsibility on everybody, including the DUP, because it has been reluctant for some time, to move to share real power under the full basis of the Good Friday Agreement. The logic of that position then is that the British and Irish Governments will have to implement all their further responsibilities. That is the position and it is the clearest position we have been at to date. I hope we will see that before we get into the end of the review, before the marching season and back into all the difficulties again. I will continue to emphasise that point as clearly as I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear the Taoiseach will be discussing Northern Ireland at some length. On 4 February, the Taoiseach informed the House that he would raise with President Bush the matter of being misled on issues surrounding the war, in particular, on the issue of the weapons of mass destruction. He stated that he recalled what President Bush told him last year and he remembered in particular what Vice-President Cheney said. Will the Taoiseach enlighten the House as to what he was told by President Bush and Vice-President Cheney on that occasion? Will he say if it influenced him to make Shannon Airport available to over 100,000 US troops <i>en route</i> to the war zone? In light of the fact that the Taoiseach says he was misled, as we all were, will he tell President Bush that the US military can no longer use Shannon Airport, given that the situation has changed?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach raise the issue of Guantanamo Bay with President Bush, seeing that the issue of the human rights of 660 individuals from 40 countries being held there illegally has been raised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the Pope, a British law lord and the International Red Cross? Will that issue be on the agenda?</P>
        <P>In an article written by the Taoiseach last year on his return from his St. Patrick's Day visit to the White House, he stated that whether military action in Iraq was justified would be determined only in light of results achieved and costs incurred. An estimated 100,000 Iraqis and 600 US and UK soldiers are dead and there has been considerable disruption and hardship because of the lack of stability. Hospitals are unable to cope and there is no telephone or postal service. Does the Taoiseach now believe that the war was justified and can he now justify the use of Shannon Airport to facilitate that war?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I said that, both the President and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, have set up an independent commission to inquire into pre-war intelligence and all these matters will be investigated. The intelligence was believed to be correct but they do not believe so now. The investigations have been set up and time will tell.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>I believe all war and violence of every kind is wrong. The innocent and those who are the least involved suffer in war. I am now more interested in the UN.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent does not understand too well and I will remind him that if we had not allowed Shannon Airport the soldiers would have travelled on to Germany, the great leader of the anti-war campaign. The Deputy's question is a nonsense and he knows it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say why he insists on continuing in this D&aacute;il the charade that has been going on for 18 months? Does the Taoiseach not understand well that the world knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and that this was an excuse to invade on foot of the imperial ambitions of the United States and Britain? I ask the Taoiseach to come clean on this matter. Before the Taoiseach goes to Washington does he not regard it as important to clarify the information he was given by the President of the United States? Has the Taoiseach protested to him or to any representative of the Administration, about the fraudulent information they gave him about weapons of mass destruction? Due to the fact that the Taoiseach purported to believe the President, he gave substantial logistical support to an invasion that resulted in the slaughter of thousands of people. Does the Taoiseach resent that in any way? Can the Taoiseach understand why I am puzzled about the equanimity with which he now accepts the truth of the matter that most of us knew for a long time?</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach arrives in Washington in March, clutching his bowl of shamrock, will he look for a public apology from the President of the United States for having conned him into being an accessory to his murderous invasion of Iraq? Will the Taoiseach justify why Mr. Bush should be allowed to use a visit to this country to boost his re-election campaign? In view of what has happened, will the Taoiseach tell him that a large majority of the Irish people have been revolted by his murderous invasion of Iraq and reject it? Perhaps the only place he will be safe from mass protests is on the top of Carrantuohill. Will the Taoiseach say where he will bring the President of the United States if he brings him to this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be up the Hag's Glen?</P>

	<P>That is another plug for Kerry tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already said that the matters of last year are subject to independent commissions both in the United States and in Britain and I will not try to resolve them during Leaders' Questions. I have listened to Deputy Higgins over the past 18 months. I have never yet heard him say, and it would be useful if he did, that he accepts the Security Council resolutions <Col N="479"/>of the last ten years that Iraq held the most severe and sophisticated weapons of mass destruction. That view was held by the Security Council up to 19 November 2002. Obviously Deputy Higgins could be proved correct and that his party's intelligence was better than those of the Prime Minister or President Bush.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not be hard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to accept that his party's intelligence was probably better in the remaining months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should not praise the Deputy too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Deputy should concede in the first case that there were weapons.</P>
        <P>On the second point, the Deputy should at all times realise that those people and countries who are anti-war gave total support in the form of facilities and logistics and that includes France and Germany in particular, and several other anti-war countries. Deputy Higgins is wrong to confuse the issues about the use of Shannon Airport or any of the other bases or logistical help given. Germany gave significant assistance. The Deputy should take the opportunity to correct that. I do not agree with Deputy Higgins's view that we should act in a hostile way to the people of the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that. Excuse me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as represented by their President. He should not talk about mass protests and antagonism when people come to this country for a summit during our Presidency of the EU. This country's close relationship with the United States has been built up over 150 years. We derive significant benefits from it for our people who work in the United States and in this country. It does no good to anybody in this House to be ranting an old antagonistic doctrine of senseless proportions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the efforts of the US and British Governments to deceive their people and the international community by making allegations about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq have been exposed, and bearing in mind that both Governments have been forced to establish inquiries into the so-called intelligence they peddled, does the Taoiseach regret that he took at face value the information that those two Governments proffered? He has already stated that he intends to raise the matter with President Bush, but in what terms will he raise the point I have made and the other points made this morning? I would like to know exactly how the Taoiseach intends to present it to President Bush. Does the Taoiseach accept, as many people <Col N="480"/>clearly do, that the invasion of Iraq concerned regime change and control?</P>
        <P>Nobody has missed the kernel of the responses the Taoiseach has given in the past to this set of questions. Does he still hold to the view that the Government should not strongly oppose the US and British-led invasion and occupation of Iraq and does he continue to believe that we should abandon positive neutrality and independent foreign policy on the grounds that it might offend the Bush Administration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already answered some of the questions asked by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. While I do not suggest that the Deputy has made such an argument, some people hold the view, based on what the Americans and British said at the end about their intelligence, that there were no weapons of mass destruction, but that is not the position. I have supported the UN throughout my political life. I supported the UN's and Dr. Blix's understanding of this matter. That is where we were throughout this issue. Our position on Iraq remains one of support for the UN.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me a fair question about what I intend to say to the President of the United States. I will state the Irish position and the EU position in respect of what we need to do now, which is the central issue. President Bush knows, because I told him at Hillsborough last year, that my position about what happened is that it would have been far better if everything had been done under a UN mandate. The UN must be at the heart of the reconstruction of Iraq if it is to be successful. The UN has the experience, capacity and perceived neutrality to carry out such a task in an objective way. We should support the efforts of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, to maximise, within the existing political and physical constraints, the role and activities of the United Nations in Iraq. That must be accepted.</P>
        <P>There must be full support for the decision to send a team to assess the feasibility of holding elections in Iraq. We hope that this process will attract the support of all the parties. We will say this to the US President. We look forward to hearing the outcome of that mission.</P>
        <P>During our Presidency, we will continue to support efforts aimed at reaching an international consensus on the way forward. In its role as holders of the EU Presidency, Ireland is pleased to join the US and other donors as part of the Iraq reconstruction core group. We will have a valuable opportunity to work closely with other donors to ensure that the reconstruction efforts in Iraq are successful.</P>
        <P>We must examine how we can deal with the terrible issues that exist in the aftermath of the war. The lesson to be learnt, which the UN has proved many times, is that it would have been better if it had happened under a UN mandate and if people had taken their time. We have argued throughout that the UN has to be central, <Col N="481"/>for example in the reconstruction process for the future.</P>

	<P>Arising from the comments of the Taoiseach, when can we expect legislation dealing with e-voting to be brought before the House? Does he intend that the legislation will be enacted before 11 June, which is the polling date for the European and local elections?</P>
      <P>On the issue of electronic matters, the Ceann Comhairle has been more than diligent in observing the rules of his predecessors and the regulations of the House. I understand that oral questions are allocated on the basis of some form of electronic lottery which takes place every evening. I notice on the list of questions to be asked of the Minister for Education and Science tomorrow that my colleague, Deputy Durkan, has been awarded three oral questions under the lottery system. I am aware that this is one question more than normal, but it could be one vote as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>

	<P>In the context of yesterday's publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, in my name, was referred to select committee on 16 June 1999. After the 2002 general election, the Government restored it to the Order Paper by Government resolution. What is the status of the Bill now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost five years since the Bill was published. It is awaiting Committee Stage &mdash; it seems it is a long wait for Committee <Col N="483"/>Stage. I am not sure if the Minister will go ahead with the legislation, but I will ask him. There is no point in having it on the Order Paper if it is not going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It was restored to the Order Paper after the 2002 election. At the time, the indications were that, having accepted the Bill on Second Stage, the Government would prosecute it through the remaining Stages. As the Taoiseach said, five years later that has not happened. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is published and this is a relevant aspect of it. I would be obliged if the Taoiseach would speak to the chairman of the select committee as well as the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I will find out the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of minutes ago the Taoiseach sang the praises of the Taliban and its hard line on drugs. Given that alcohol advertisements are shown in cinemas during pictures where children under 12 years must be accompanied, is it not important we get on with the alcohol products Bill to review the position whereby there is a free run in terms of alcohol advertising? When will that legislation be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more like alcohol free-flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Sargent it is important legislation. The heads of the Bill have been completed and it is in the drafting queue. The legislation was due to be introduced before the summer but due to the parliamentary counsel's involvement in other legislation, it went down the order. I will ask about the Bill's progress again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Apropos the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, when will Second Stage be taken in the House? I am worried that it might be done on the plinth or in RTE. As the Administration is preoccupied with information, I would also like to know when will the Bill to replace the Official Secrets Act be introduced? Some indications have been made on the plinth and elsewhere outside the House regarding the format of the prison services Bill. When will that Bill be introduced? I am not sure whether the proposal is to set aside 100 acres or 1,000 acres as a prison location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a date for the prison services Bill which will put on a statutory basis an independent prison service and related matters. As I understand it, the service is run on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and is working very well. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, which has just been published, will I hope be introduced soon because it has been long awaited. The first preliminary draft of the criminal justice (protection of confidential information) Bill has been received <Col N="484"/>in the Department and is under consideration. It is hoped it will be introduced in 2004.</P>

	<P>I asked yesterday about two separate Bills on the programme for the spring session, both of which are titled the dormant accounts Bill. I recall that one is under the Department of Finance and the other under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. In the Taoiseach's reply yesterday, he indicated that the latter Bill is under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is not what appears in the circularised programme of legislation for the current session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarification on this matter because the dormant accounts (amendment) Bill is clearly stated under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This arose directly from Deputy Rabbitte's question yesterday. I seek clarification from the Taoiseach on this matter because there is a discrepancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no discrepancy. The dormant accounts (amendment) Bill is being prepared under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and will be introduced, I hope, in this session. The other Bill referred to is the dormant funds account Bill which is to do with the funds held in the courts and is included in Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an appeal by the Christian Brothers which has delayed the legislation and as soon as that appeal is heard the legislation can be moved forward.</P>

      <P LI="1">&ldquo; &lsquo;employee&rsquo; has the same meaning as &lsquo;worker&rsquo; has in section 23 of the Industrial Relations Acct 1990;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin's amendment seeks to use the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; as set out in section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to define an employee in this Bill. Section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 defines a worker as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person who is or was employed whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises, but does not include a member of the Defence Forces or of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for reflecting on the case I made on Committee Stage. I tabled the original amendment there and have retabled it now to avoid any confusion and difficulties in the future. It was pointed out that the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; used in this Bill is unusual and that the Industrial Relations Act 1990 used the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; and defined it there. The amendment I tabled on Committee Stage was to prevent any inconsistency between the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the 1990 Act and this new Bill. I am convinced that the Minister of State has considered it and that there is no difficulty or inconsistency if that assurance has been given again.</P>

      <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage I indicated that I was considering bringing forward a further amendment on Report Stage to section 2 of the 2001 Act. Section 2 of this Act empowers the Labour Court to investigate a trade dispute in certain circumstances, including where, &ldquo;it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations&rdquo;. A situation could arise where an employer engages in collective bargaining negotiations for certain grades, groups or categories of workers but not with others. In such cases it may be considered that the employer engaged in collective bargaining in these circumstances and certain grades, groups or categories of workers would not have recourse to the provision of the 2001 Act. To avoid any doubt I propose this amendment to section 2.1(<i>a</i>) of the 2001 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State's point but the point I made on Committee Stage, and in tabling the amendment there, was to ensure there would be no mechanism for employers to avoid the import of the legislation by establishing in-house committees. I assumed that the Minister of State's new amendment before us was intended to address that issue. I am not clear whether that issue will be addressed solely by this amendment and whether it is designed to meet the point I made. I thought the Minister of State had accepted my point on Committee Stage that there should be no mechanism for in-house committees being established by employers in order to frustrate this vehicle which we are putting in place for the resolution of disputes. Is that what the Minister <Col N="489"/>of State intends by this and does this amendment meet the point I made on Committee Stage and the argument I made for what is now amendment No. 5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Our amendment meets the Deputy's requirements. Section 2 of the Bill replaces section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) with the provision which allows the Labour Court to investigate a trade dispute if one of the following two conditions has been met: that the employer has failed to comply with the timeframe specified in the amended code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution or any exclusion of the timeframes agreed by the parties, or the Labour Court receives a report from the Labour Relations Commission that no further efforts on the part of the commission will advance the resolution of the dispute. On the point made by Deputy Howlin, I am satisfied that this amendment adequately covers that position.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo; &lsquo;(<i>a</i>) it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations in respect of the grade, group or category of workers who are party to the trade dispute and the internal dispute resolution procedures (if any) normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute,</P>

      <P FLI="0">This deals with the same issue. The assurance has been given regarding the fear about the advice given to establish in-house committees to frustrate the meaningful procedures spelled out in this enactment. The Minister of State said his amendment overcomes that issue. For that reason, I will not press my amendment. I understand the Minister of State has given me that assurance.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(i) the employee, or a trade union or an excepted body of which he or she is a member, having taken any step referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I made the point on Committee Stage that the new section on victimisation is unusually worded in that it prohibits discrimination against persons on the grounds of being a member of a trade union but not specifically on the more traditional and basic definition of victimisation, namely, to punish someone for invoking a procedure set forth in the legislation. My amendment is designed to include the core of victimisation within the definition of the section. The section should specifically cover the process of invoking the legislation as well as membership. That is at the heart of my suggestion. I know the Minister of State indicated on Committee Stage that this was encompassed by the term &ldquo;trade union membership&rdquo;. However, I would like him to clarify that not only membership of a trade union but also the process of invoking the procedures spelled out in this legislation are covered in the anti-discrimination concept implicit in the Bill.</P>

	<P>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment. I would like to have tabled other amendments, but it would have been a copycat exercise and I try to avoid that.

I would have preferred if the Government had done more to tackle low pay and to ensure that State workers received a proper minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing amendment No. 6 and we have done extremely well. Members have discussed only the amendments before us. I would prefer if the Deputy dealt with amendment No. 6 and did not stray outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do that. However, I wanted to explain why I did not table amendments to the Bill. The Government and the employers' organisations are forcing workers to negotiate at partnership level for rights which should be theirs automatically and legally. That is unfortunate. The Bill should have been used as an opportunity to deal with the important issue of enshrining <Col N="491"/>union recognition in law. It is unsatisfactory that this did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage I agreed to reconsider Deputy Howlin's proposed amendment. I sought further legal advice on the matter and have been advised that the text, as it stands, covers Deputy Howlin's suggested amendment. I accept the point he made today. However, the prohibition of victimisation applies only in the context of a dispute where the code of practice or the voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or where a request has been made to the Labour Court to investigate a dispute under section 2 of the Act of 2001.</P>
      <P>An employer, employee, trade union or an excepted body of which the employee is a member shall not victimise a person for the following reasons: an employee being or not being a member of a trade union or excepted body; an employee engaging or not engaging in activities on behalf of a trade union or an exempted body &mdash; engaging in activities on behalf of a trade union includes taking any steps to invoke the code of voluntary dispute resolution; or requesting the Labour Court to investigate a dispute under section 2 of the Act. The text, as it stands, encompasses the amendment tabled by Deputy Howlin. I give him the assurance he sought in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept the Minister of State's comments in that regard. I am happy to withdraw my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;but not later than 6 months after such expiration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment arises out of Committee Stage debate. The Minister of State moved amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage which is now part of the amended Bill. It stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(7) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (6)</i>, a rights commissioner may entertain a complaint under this section presented to him or her after the expiration of the period referred to in <i>subsection (6)</i> but not later than 6 months after such expiration, if he or she is satisfied that the failure to present the complaint within that period was due to reasonable cause.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">My amendment seeks to delete the sub-clause, &ldquo;but not later than 6 months after such expiration&rdquo;. The import of my amendment is that it would be open to a rights commissioner to entertain a complaint at a time later than six months after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (6) so that there would not be such a tight closure on these matters. The caveat is already in the legislation that to entertain the complaint after the expiration of time, the rights <Col N="492"/>commissioner must be satisfied there is reasonable cause. That covers the difficulties. If there is not reasonable cause for delay, it will not be entertained. There should not be such tight closure in these matters. The Minister of State may ask me to envisage circumstances in which a complaint could not be made at an earlier date. I cannot do that instantly, but I am sure such circumstances can arise. When we are enshrining it in statute we should not be so prescriptive, we should allow flexibility.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I invited the Minister to meet me half way on this matter. If he does not want the deletion of the &ldquo;6 months after such expiration&rdquo; he should make it 12 months so that a line could be drawn, with which I would be content. The inclusion of the need for &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;, which must be believed by a rights commissioner, should be adequate in itself. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. I know he has referred to two periods of six months, which gives a year. There are and will be occasions when Murphy's law will prevail and this provision will preclude a person taking an action, which is unfair.</P>
      <P>If a sustainable case is accepted by a rights commissioner, there should be no legal impediment to the rights commissioner dealing with that complaint. I do not understand why the Minister is so insistent on having such a narrow window of opportunity of six months plus a further six months. While this represents some movement from the Minister's original position, I would like him to go a step further to accept my amendment and accept a 12-month additional time period rather than the six months inserted as a result of the Minister's Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. A person involved in a bad accident who ends up in ill health or in hospital, with for example a back injury, for a period of six months may not be of a frame of mind to take action in the period prescribed under the Bill. A person who has suffered stress could end up in a psychiatric institution. If there is bluff involved, the safety net for that is the rights commissioner who should be able to establish whether it is the case and deal with it accordingly. The Deputy's amendment is sensible, practical and fair to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>We deliberated long and hard over this issue to find a balance. We had a useful discussion on Committee Stage on the extension of the time period in which the rights commissioner could accept a complaint of victimisation. We agreed on the extension of the time period in certain cases. The Bill as amended on Committee Stage extends the time in which a rights commissioner can accept such complaints by six months. This extension is sufficient and results in a total of one year during which the complaint can be made. A year is a reasonable timeframe and provides certainty by being <Col N="493"/>definitive. It is necessary to bring closure within a reasonable timescale. Following the case cogently put by Deputy Howlin, we compromised to a degree.</P>
      <P>I take the point about a person who might not be of the right frame of mind. However, even if the period were extended to 18 months the same might still apply. Overall I believe our compromise is reasonable and I hope it is acceptable to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We debated this on Committee Stage and I hoped that the Minister, while not accepting my amendment to make this open-ended, would be willing to allow a 12-month period. The Minister's point about the need for some finality is well made. However, an arguable case could be made that it should be within the ability of the rights commissioner to allow a case to be made to him. If the rights commissioner believes the case and the grounds for delay to be reasonable, he should be able to take the complaint. That principle operates in the courts. We do not define exactly what a judge must do. It is up to the judge to have regard to the specifics of each case put so that unique circumstances, some of which we cannot even envisage, can be entertained. I would have preferred it that way.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister wants a deadline to give finality. It would be more reasonable to allow a further six months. I would have been content with what I would have thought was a reasonable compromise from the Minister to amend the six months extension in section 5(6) to 12 months. I am disappointed he would not do even that much, while I accept the arguable case not to delete the timeframe and leave it open. I hope even now the Minister will offer some compromise and change the timeframe to 12 months. We would then have a bargain that would be good for the exceptional case that is bound to arise under Murphy's law. Somebody who convinces a rights commissioner that there are reasonable grounds in presenting a case could by statute be barred by this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am sympathetic to the case made, I think that 12 months is reasonable. It is a question of striking a balance. In any dispute 12 months is reasonable. While I accept the spirit of the Deputy's argument it is necessary to stick with the 12 months. I have compromised to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P><Col N="494"/>
      <P LI="2">14.&mdash;The First Schedule to the Industrial Relations Act 1990 is amended by substituting in column (3), at reference number 7, &lsquo;&euro;3,000&rsquo; for &lsquo;1,000&rsquo; and &lsquo;&euro;1,000&rsquo; for &lsquo;200&rsquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage I indicated I was considering increasing the fines that can be imposed by the courts under section 32(4)<Miles com="jy"/>of the Industrial Relations Act 1946. Section 32 of the 1946 Act relates to breaches of registered employment agreements. Employment agreements are agreements between a worker or a trade union and an employer or an employer body, or representatives of workers and representatives of employers at a joint industrial council, which relate to the remuneration or conditions of employment of workers. These agreements may be registered with the Labour Court. When registered with the court these agreements are legally binding not only on the parties to the agreement but also on others in the class, type or group to which the agreements are expressed to apply.</P>
      <P>I have examined the issues and I propose to increase the existing fine of &euro;1,269.70 to &euro;3,000. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed upon summary convictions by the District Court. I also propose to increase the fine that can be imposed for every day during which the offence continues, from &euro;253.94 per day to &euro;1,000 per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government amendment. Even if it is only good accounting, the notion of having a maximum fine ending with 70 cent was not good, and rounding up to a reasonable fine is appropriate. While bringing it up to the threshold available to the District Court is a good idea, I thought we had addressed the issue of the thresholds of the District and Circuit Courts in the Courts and Court Officers Acts. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of recent court decisions on including as much detail as possible in primary legislation, the definition of &ldquo;victimisation&rdquo; seems to be vague. Does the Minister think that an appendix should be attached to clarify this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Everybody involved in the process is clear on this. The legislation spells out clearly what is being dealt with and there is no doubt about the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill as amended received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the <Col N="495"/>Bill. I especially thank Deputy Howlin for the work he put into the Bill and the amendments he put forward. I thank the Deputies who contributed on Second and Committee Stages. We have had a useful debate on this Bill and as a result improved its quality. Important amendments have been introduced, for example, the inclusion of further definitions in section 1; an amendment to section 2 of the 2001 Act to ensure that all grades, groups and categories of worker are covered by the Act; the clarification of the definition of &ldquo;victimisation&rdquo; in section 8; and an extension of the timeframe in which a rights commissioner can hear a complaint of victimisation in section 9. I have also used the opportunity presented by the Bill to bring in a technical amendment to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.</P>
      <P>The Bill resulted from an agreed approach by the trade unions and employer organisations, under Sustaining Progress, to enhance the effectiveness of the existing procedures for dealing with disputes where negotiating agreements are not in place. I place on record my appreciation for the trade union and employer organisation representatives involved in the negotiation of this agreement and I acknowledge their achievement in reaching an agreed approach to enhancing existing provisions in the context of disputes where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place. This is another example of the responsible approach to partnership taken by the trade union and employer leadership.</P>
      <P>The basic aim of the Bill is to strengthen the industrial relations procedures given effect through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and to introduce a prohibition on victimisation of employees in the context of a dispute where the code of practice or voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or where steps have been taken to invoke the code. The Bill will be supported by a revised code of practice or voluntary dispute resolution and also a code of practice on victimisation. The Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be an important part of the industrial relations legislative framework. This legislation will contribute to greater stability in the field of industrial relations. I thank the staff in my Department for the considerable amount of work they have put into this legislation within a tight timeframe and for their advice and assistance to me throughout the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his kind comments. I am glad this legislation is to be enacted, but I am mindful of the comments I made on Second Stage that the Bill will not have a great impact. It does a number of good things, particularly in the area of protecting workers from victimisation, but there is a bigger job to do. We must address the issue of the growing non-recognition of trade unions and trade union <Col N="496"/>membership. While I wish God speed and a fair wind to this Bill, I hope that without great delay we will be faced with a more substantial Bill which deals with that core issue.</P>
      <P>As a society, we need to come to terms with these matters. The Government lauds the concept of partnership and the role the trade union movement has played not only in building our economic success over the past decade but also in ensuring industrial peace and the protection of workers' rights. These rights cover a number of areas, not only pay and conditions but also safety, which the Minister of State dealt with at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business this morning. This is an important concern for trade unions. It is for all those reasons &mdash; pay, conditions and safety &mdash; as well as for the avoidance of disputes that the trade union movement is important and will remain important into the future, notwithstanding changing work practices. I would welcome the Government addressing this issue and I hope a Bill to that effect will be introduced before too long.</P>
      <P>Many of us in the House are concerned when legislation is agreed within the social partnership mechanism before Members of the House have even seen it. Often Ministers have come to the House unable to accept amendments, even when they are minded to, because they have not gone through the partnership process and a balance has been negotiated outside the House. This diminishes the status of the Oireachtas. I welcome the approach of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to this Bill. Although it was funnelled through the negotiation process of social partnership, he was open to hearing arguments from this side of the House and accepting amendments. I hope that principle will be protected by Government so that the value of the democratic scrutiny afforded by this and the other House is not diminished by agreements done by others who are not elected directly by the people.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment changes the definition of &ldquo;Companies Acts&rdquo; in section 1, which is concerned with interpretation and construction. It is a technical issue.

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 15 to 19.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with commencement provisions. It is to do with the way in which the relevant Acts are to be repealed. There is no disagreement between the two sides of the House on the legislation that is to be repealed. The issue is more to do with style than substance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten argued on Committee Stage that the Bill dealt with commencement in sections 2, 6 and 13. His proposed amendment on that Stage would have effectively relocated the commencement provisions so they were all dealt with in one place. I agreed to consider the amendment before Report Stage. I have done that and consulted the parliamentary counsel. As a result I am prepared to take on board the points made by Deputy Naughten and put forward an amendment which will meet his requirements.</P>
      <P>The amendment is textually slightly different from that proposed by Deputy Naughten. However, the differences do not relate to substance. There is no disagreement about repealing the relevant Acts and Deputy Naughten's amendments do not contest it. They contested the manner in which we dealt with the commencement and repeal provisions. My amendments are designed to afford maximum flexibility with regard to the commencement orders and the repeal of the relevant Acts, and amendment No. 2 deals fully with Deputy Naughten's concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P><Col N="498"/>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;for so long as he or she thinks fit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I previously described this legislation as an enabling blueprint for privatisation and none of the amendments put forward by the Minister will change that. I oppose the plans to sell Aer Lingus. Following the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister agreed to the insertion of a requirement that the Minister for Finance would be unable to dispose of shares in the company without the general principle of the disposal being approved by the D&aacute;il. While it is a welcome development, I doubt that it can be seen as an improvement to the Bill. In practical terms, it makes little difference and serves as a cosmetic change to allow the Government to pretend it takes the D&aacute;il seriously.</P>
      <P>The Government, particularly this Minister, presents a clear danger to semi-State companies with their blind faith in market forces and privatisation as the solution to our economic problems. In less than two years the Minister has initiated confrontations with a variety of public sector unions and has exacerbated the situation by refusing to negotiate except through media soundbites. This legislation gives the Minister for Finance the power to sell the company at any time he or she sees fit. When the decision is made, which could be as vague as the Minister desires, and judging by his proposal to break up Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and CIE we can expect a high level of vagueness, the general principle of the Bill will be voted through by the Government Deputies, after the Opposition is allowed to talk a little about what a bad deal it is. It is because the amendment made no difference to the ability of the Government to sell the company that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, had no difficulty accepting it. It does not make a great difference whether the Minister for Finance can sell shares in the company at the drop of a hat or must come to the D&aacute;il for a rubber stamp. This Bill is primarily about the desire of the Government to sell Aer Lingus using employee share ownership as a cover.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is a successful and profitable company and a valuable State asset. The Government is not capable of exercising the power that would be granted to it under this legislation so my amendments are designed to restrict its ability to do so. I make no apology for that. The amendments seek to remove some power from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The company made a loss of &euro;139.9 million in 2001. A year later, in 2002, it had been turned around to make a profit of &euro;35.3 million. The most recent results for the first half of 2003 point to an operating profit of &euro;14.3 million against an operating loss of &euro;12.6 million for the same period the previous year. Passenger numbers have increased since 2001. We are talking about selling a State asset that has been supported by workers and taxpayers down through the years. <Col N="499"/>It is a disgrace. This is enabling legislation to bring about privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister take this opportunity to respond to a newspaper report last week on the Minister's plans to privatise the company? The report referred to selling 40% of the company initially to the institutions and floating the company at a future date. It said this was a proposal from the board of Aer Lingus and that the Minister supported it. Will the Minister clarify the situation? Was there a formal proposal from the board and, if so, was it endorsed by the full board? What was the date of that proposal from the board? Does the Minister consider it appropriate that people who have a vested interest in privatising a semi-State company should be the people to advise him, given the likely payola that will be available for senior management and members of the board? Would it not be advisable and more appropriate to get independent advice and not to take directions from the board if there is such a proposal?</P>
      <P>With regard to the newspaper report that 40% of the company would be sold initially, will the Minister explain what this sale of 40% of Aer Lingus to financial institutions will do for the company? The revenue raised by such a sale would obviously return to the Government's coffers. It would not be invested in the company. Why would the sale of 40% of the company benefit Aer Lingus? The impression is being conveyed that it would be good for the company if it was part or wholly privatised. What benefits would accrue to the Aer Lingus company from privatising any part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the alleged proposal that 40% of the company be sold, what effect would this have on Aer Lingus employees? We are told there will be more redundancies among ground staff in Shannon Airport because Aer Lingus head office has informed Aer Lingus in Shannon that it must cut costs by 15%. This will probably result in redundancies. What benefit would the company secure from selling a 40% share, particularly with regard to the employees and job prospects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation provides the legal framework to facilitate the sale of shares in the event that the Government decides to go down that road. On Committee Stage we inserted an amendment to the effect that the Minister for Finance may not dispose of any shares in the company without the general principles of the disposal being laid before, and approved by, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. To be clear, the D&aacute;il will have to approve any Government decision to sell any shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the concerns raised by Deputies about specific issues in the event of the State exiting from the ownership of Aer Lingus. Having taken those concerns on board, I moved <Col N="500"/>the amendment to which I already referred which gives some comfort to Members with regard to the future direction we may take. I assure the House that if the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus, I will set out the basis for any Government decision, including the arguments for and against such a direction. I have also committed myself to set out how the Government proposes to deal with important strategic issues such as slots at Heathrow. I will, of course, also outline the general principles of any proposed sale or move in that direction.</P>
      <P>On the specific questions raised, Deputy Shortall asked me about the newspaper and company reports. I cannot say that the report I have is specifically a board document. I cannot say that to her. I had a meeting with the chairman and chief executive &mdash; in September I think &mdash; at which they presented me with a report from the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a proposal now? It was reported as a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>What I have is a report from the chairman and chief executive. They presented it to me as a company report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>A report on what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was on the possible future strategic direction of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Were they speaking in a personal capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I took it that they were speaking fully for, and that the report was for, the company. I since understand that they have briefed the board on the matters contained in the report. I want to be clear that the report which has been presented is, as far as I am concerned, from the company Aer Lingus. It was presented to me by the chairman and chief executive as a company report and they have briefed the board fully on its contents. As far as I am concerned that is its status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>When did they brief the board? Was it subsequent to the newspaper reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the date. I am not privy to the inner management and structures of how and when they do their briefings. I do not want that report to become a major occasion or document. It is an input into a system and process and that is all.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's advice that I should get independent advice. The Department asked Mr. Hooper, formerly of the Bank of Ireland, to examine some issues. He has given me a very brief report also on the issues available to us and with which it is possible for us to deal in the context of any move forward in the area. The <Col N="501"/>Deputy is right; independent advice in the area is important. I will deal with that issue shortly and certainly long before the Government makes any decisions.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Crowe, I do not want to get argumentative because Aer Lingus is a very good company. It has turned around and over 1,500 people have left the company in the past 12 months. This was done without losing a single day. It was negotiated. It cost the company many millions to bring this change about but it did it and there is a good working relationship between both sides.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that this Bill is not designed to sell Aer Lingus under the cover of the ESOP but that it legalises the 14.9% that the staff of Aer Lingus get. I do not begrudge that to them as they are entitled to a share in their company. However, I sometimes worry when people do not consider shares given to the workers, up to 15% of a company, as privatisation &mdash; because the shareholders happen to be workers &mdash; but if shares are sold to ordinary taxpayers, the customers, somehow that is not a good thing to do. All of us have supported the awarding of shares in the company to the staff and workforce. I am sure they are in good hands and they deserve them. However, we cannot have it both ways. We have taken shares from the taxpayer and have given them to the workers. Therefore we cannot cry too much over the taxpayers. That is a big debate and I do not wish to get into it now.</P>
      <P>I have probably dealt with the other matters mentioned in that newspaper report. It did suggest that I had made up my mind on this issue but I have not. I am working through a process of discussions with the company and taking some independent advice. I will shortly have a full discussion with Cabinet on the options available to the company. After that full discussion we will decide how to proceed. I do not want to rehearse the arguments in the context of this Bill but there are strong arguments for the company staying as it is and for the taxpayer to continue investing in it. There are equally strong arguments for the taxpayer taking time to examine whether attracting private investment into the company, in terms of building up its future assets, is appropriate. There are arguments on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Minister mean? He says there are strong arguments for continuing as it is and for getting the taxpayer to invest in its future. Is it not true that the chairman and chief executive indicated clearly that they do not want or need any further investment at this stage in funding for Aer Lingus and that they also indicated that they would give the Minister &euro;30 million in the context of any privatisation that might take place?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Yes, but the Minister should answer the other one afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to it. I will present a document which will lay out the pros and cons. I take the Deputy's point. There is a view which says that Aer Lingus will never again need investment because it is doing so well. Deputies should think about that. Another argument says it is growing so fast and there are so many new routes on offer that it will require substantial funds for investment in new aircraft, routes and strategies. We must think about both of these and consider which we believe. Whether we think the company will require further investment is an issue to which we will come, if the Government takes a decision to proceed.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o'clock</TimeSt><P>To come to Deputy Shortall's question, I cannot deal with the matter of from where newspaper reports come. The newspaper report did lay out what the Aer Lingus report purported to contain &mdash; the ESOP, five strategic options, an evaluation of the company's view and a private placement to institutional investors. It rehearsed arguments which were and are in the chairman's report to me, such as the argument about the various options if the Government decided to sell shares in Aer Lingus. It also expressed a preference for a model which suggested institutional placement to investors initially, followed later by an IPO. To that extent the newspaper report was accurate. I have not arrived at any conclusion on these issues. I need to study them and to talk further with advisers and the company to see what is the best road forward for the company.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not sell Aer Lingus. It allocates the 14.9% finally and commits the Government to coming back to the House if it attempts to sell any of Aer Lingus. It will have to come back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we get further clarification on this. The newspaper report outlining the Minister's position in respect of the future of Aer Lingus indicated it had emanated from the Minister's Department. Did that report <Col N="503"/>in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week emanate from his Department?</P>
     
      <P>In that article it was suggested that there was a proposal from the board of Aer Lingus on the future ownership of the company and that the Minister had accepted that proposal. The Minister has informed us that there is not a proposal, there is a report. Will the Minister clarify the status of the report? Did the chief executive and chairman of Aer Lingus draw up this report? Is that all it is or has it any other status? Was it presented to the board before it was presented to the Minister?</P>
      <P>In light of his earlier commitment to discuss issues with Members of the House and to be open about what he is proposing to do, will the Minister make a copy of that report available to the Opposition spokespersons so that we can be in possession of the same advice he has had from the company, which is a semi-State company?</P>
      <P>In the newspaper report the Minister is reported as favouring the sale of 40% of the company to financial institutions. The main purpose of the Bill is to sell part, or all, of Aer Lingus. Will the Minister explain what benefit will accrue to the company on the sale of up to 30%, 40% or 50% of the company, given that the proceeds from such a sale will come back into the Government coffers and will not be used for re-investment in the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Crowe. There is no good reason for the privatisation of Aer Lingus. It is a premier State company that has been built by the taxpayers of this country and by the commitment of a dedicated workforce over many decades. In reality there has been little State investment for most of those decades.</P>
      <P>What is driving the Minister for Transport's proposal to bring the Aer Lingus Bill before the D&aacute;il to provide for the inevitable privatisation of this premier State-owned company? It is clear that the Government is driven purely by the Minister's ideological commitment to a right-wing economic policy whereby he believes that crucial public assets should be transferred to big business interests. This is exactly what he is trying to do with Dublin Bus and what he also wishes to do in future with Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>The ownership of a critical air transport facility is of great importance to an island nation. The Minister should not pretend that the Bill does not relate to privatisation. We know that is his agenda. We know from the experience of almost seven years of these parties in government that this is the Government's agenda.</P>
      <Miles com="ah"/><P>What is the experience of other crucial State assets and semi-State and publicly owned companies that have been privatised? Within a short period of time they find their way into the hands of major multinational corporations and become the playthings of international speculators and major multinational corporations.</P><Col N="504"/><Miles com="xh"/>
      <P>It will be one of the shameful legacies of the Government that, for example, our telecommunications industry should have been handed over in this way to millionaires, tax exile billionaires and people who have no commitment to the welfare of the majority of people in the State. Giving a crucial air transport facility in an island nation over to these forces is particularly dangerous for the future of Irish air transport. If their commitment to greater profits dictate that services are cut back or otherwise changed and rationalised the welfare or needs of the Irish travelling public will not be the main priority.</P>
      <P>What the Government has allowed to happen has been a source of great scandal to the majority of taxpayers. The rainbow Government gave the crucial mobile phone licence for a song to an individual who was able to speculate with it and walk away with a personal fortune of 250 million. These resources properly belong to the people. It demeans our society that Eircom, for example, and other important industries that were once in public ownership are now merely the subject of fights and contests between various sharks operating in the world economy.</P>
      <P>The idea of people piloting the company, which they have been given in trust to run for the people, towards privatisation raises critical ethical issues, which need to be debated. It is impermissible that leading executives in Aer Lingus should move to assist the privatisation of a premier State-owned company when they stand to gain massively from that privatisation, which is exactly what happened with the privatisation of Telecom. It is immoral and should not be allowed.</P>
      <P>In the seven years of the Government parties being in office, we have seen a tendency develop in the public sector whereby individuals with no commitment to maintaining public ownership of these companies are looking at the vast riches they can personally make for themselves through their privatisation. That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>As a preparation for privatisation we saw the values and brutal methods of the anti-union companies in public air transport being brought to bear in Aer Lingus in recent times. This was an attempt to relentlessly worsen the conditions of workers who have given such great commitment, instead of bringing Aer Lingus workers to the heart of the management of the company and putting in the necessary State investment to this State-owned company, and to develop it for the benefit of ordinary people in an affordable way. The trade union movement and the ICTU should wholeheartedly support amendment No. 4. The idea of a certain cohort of share ownership for workers is trap for those workers. It is a cynical attempt by the Government that tries to foist privatisation on the workforce. I remind the Government that this company belongs to the entirety of the people. We have seen this company develop in public ownership. It is not in the ownership of the <Col N="505"/>Government or any other sector. A proposal that goes any step towards privatisation should be rejected out of hand.</P></Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage, members of the Government parties, especially those from constituencies close to Dublin Airport, made a cogent case as to why Aer Lingus should not be privatised. It would be interesting to hear the Minister responding to his backbenchers. When asked whether they felt it would be good policy by the Government to sell the company, they said that it would not and was not in the long-term strategic interests of the company, workers or the public interest. I agree with and commend those Deputies on the Government side. I would like to see them return to the Chamber to discuss these crucial amendments.</P>
      <P>Given the limitations in the Bill, I commend my colleague from the Technical Group, Deputy Crowe, for tabling these amendments. It is difficult to amend this legislation in a straightforward manner other than by deleting the section that gives the Minister the power to sell the company. It was clear on Second Stage that the main intent of the Bill was to prepare for the sale of the company. I regret that the Minister was not more upfront and frank about this. Had he been, we could have had a more concentrated debate.</P>
      <P>The Government has followed what is known as the &ldquo;Washington Consensus&rdquo; for a number of years. The Government seems to believe that social or business objectives cannot be achieved through public enterprise. There is a suggestion that public enterprise is unable to organise the affairs of a company to operate properly in the market and provide the necessary services. I disagree with this basic assumption. I have met a number of people working in public enterprise <Col N="506"/>and I have full faith in them. The ownership structure often allows them to operate in such a way that benefits the proper long-term development of the business. This is the proper background against which these services can be provided. I do not believe that those on this side of the House have an ideological difficulty with the use of public enterprise in the provision of such services. In many cases, such enterprises can serve the public and the State much better.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has a problem with the way a company operates, he or she can change the board, policy and management structure. While European directives may say Ministers cannot be responsible for public companies in services, we have seen governments fighting to protect their rights to issue management directions in other areas. I do not see why we cannot do the same in this case.</P>
      <P>My party is in favour of the principle of worker participation in companies. This leads to a better working environment and decision-making within the company. Giving a voice in the boardroom to those working on the ground is a clever move. Giving them a share of the profit of the company is an example of good business sense and good social policy. It is also a good economic policy for the country. I support the development and use of employee share ownership schemes and trusts as a way of furthering this goal.</P>
      <P>The Minister commented on the Second Stage debate that the reason for giving a 14.9% stake in the company to employees was that it is Government policy to give such a stake where the State is exiting a company. This is not the correct strategy. It does not pursue an ideology that encourages worker participation. In essence, it says this stake will be given to workers to compensate them for the State withdrawing from the business. What message does this give to workers in Aer Lingus? What message does it give to workers throughout the country about the possibility of becoming more involved in management decision-making?</P>
      <P>It is deeply regrettable that we are linking the provision of employee share ownership trusts with the sale and privatisation of companies. Yesterday on the Order of Business, Deputy Broughan asked the Taoiseach about the position of the ESOT for An Post. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources looked at one another questioningly and came to the conclusion that it is going nowhere. The reason for this is that the company is in severe financial difficulties. Therefore, there are no plans to privatise it and the employee share ownership plan will not be introduced. This is not the way to operate ESOTs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent raised the issue of ESOTs during Leaders' Questions. Some workers may perceive some of the criticisms my party has directed at the actions of the Government in the Eircom case as being criticisms of ESOTs. It is <Col N="507"/>far from it. The Green Party supports such trusts and seeing workers rewarded. However, the circumstances in the Eircom case, where the workers received a preference shareholding to encourage a further buy-out of the company by venture capitalists, runs against the long-term general interests of workers in terms of participation. Preference shareholding does not convey voting rights. Owing to the tax changes meted out by the Government, we may see more trusts take the form of preference shares. Under this, it will be safe for employers to feed a certain tax-free revenue stream to workers without giving them a say in how the company is run. This is another reason this secret deal was bad not only for the public, but also for workers.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that the Aer Lingus workers will understandably be looking at that deal and asking how they are magically to double their stake to 30% of the company on a tax-free basis. I would have to caution the workers that, while the Eircom deal proved to be incredibly lucrative and successful for the unions involved, future returns from a shareholding trust would be far more difficult and precarious after selling an airline. As the Minister knows, the airline business is far more cyclical, with no real fixed assets backing in the same way as Eircom. We are selling goodwill, know-how and the skills of the workforce as much as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The allowable debate is on the ownership of shares by the Minister, his voting role and the implications for same, so Members should keep to the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to draw my remarks to a close, but I am coming around to the point that the sale of the company will not be the magic solution for the workers that the Minister may think. We are dealing with a company in a very cyclical business where large profits, as well as significant losses, can be made in a short period. There is no certainty as to the future of the company in that open market. In such circumstances, the Irish public and State could also be at a significant disadvantage. If we are losing an airline with a strategic role in connecting us &mdash; as Deputy Higgins said, an island nation &mdash; to the rest of Europe and the world, I do not see the business logic or the benefits in our selling that control and the fall-back position that we have where the State can ultimately decide the future direction, strengths and weaknesses of the company. We are giving up control of a vital transport asset in this Bill, and my party is certainly opposed to that. I imagine that many Deputies on the Government side realise that it is short-term ideology and not necessarily in the best interests of this country. I ask the Minister to reconsider those plans and the Deputies on the other side who expressed reservations about such privatisation to consider <Col N="508"/>supporting the amendments before us, particularly No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to get into a Second Stage debate on this issue, but I rise to support amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive. They go to the kernel of this Bill, whose original purpose was to raise the shareholding of Aer Lingus workers to 14.9%. That was fair enough, but at the end of the Bill, the Minister proposed to take it upon himself to decide to sell shares in Aer Lingus. Committee Stage, on which the Minister referred to that without the general principle of the disposal being laid before and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, represented a major move. However, it also begs us to come to terms with the Minister's direction.</P>
      <P>All of us who have been involved at constituency, regional or national level in terms of the future of Aer Lingus, most importantly, a viable future for the company and this country, are concerned to find the best way to achieve that. We might differ from the Minister in that we feel that there is no need at this stage to privatise the company. I can recall the early 1990s when we had the Cahill plan, which devastated the workforce and brought about major changes. The workforce and we were told very clearly that if Aer Lingus was to have a future, we had to make it viable, and everyone had to pull up their socks and tighten their belts in that context. They did that, but then we were told that we could not get any more equity. No further State equity would be approved by the EU to copperfasten Aer Lingus. Significant changes were made, and we now have a viable company which can show what it can do with the proper management and the full support of the staff. They turned around Aer Lingus, which is now a viable organisation.</P>
      <P>However, now people are coming along who were not interested in the past but have their greedy eyes on Aer Lingus and speculate about what profit they can make from involvement in the sale or purchase of the company. If we are all up-front and have the same objective of trying to do what is best for the future of Aer Lingus, it is imperative that we all be at one &mdash; the Minister and his officials, the board, the chairman, the chief executive, the workforce, the elected Members and the public. They must all be involved in this process of deciding where we are going. However, the great difficulty is that in many ways we do no know where the Minister is coming from. There is a perception abroad, which I tend to share, that the Minister's thinking, as has been shown with Aer Rianta and Dublin Bus and we can see now with Aer Lingus, is that selling things off is the way forward.</P>
      <P>This afternoon there is once again reference to a media report which emanated from the Minister's Department. Many would say that it had his fingerprints on it and that it represents his ideas on future moves. It is very important to achieve clarity and ensure that we are all at one in that regard, particularly those working in the <Col N="509"/>company. What was the status of that report? Was it verbal, as has been said in recent newspaper reports? Did the chief executive and the chairman meet the Minister to give him a written report? He gave the Minister a written report, so the Minister has one. The Minister's understanding was that it represented the position of the Aer Lingus board.</P>
      <Miles com="cl" par="113"/><P>We all get feedback from various sources, but I understand that that was not the position of the Aer Lingus board and that the company made no decision and gave no authorisation to the chairman or chief executive to write a report indicating to the Minister that it was in favour of a 40% sale of Aer Lingus. If that is so, it is extremely serious. If we are to resolve this problem and ensure that we have a strong Aer Lingus which can compete against anyone, including Ryanair, we must all be singing from the same hymn sheet. Senior Aer Lingus executives cannot perform solo. If the chief executive or chairman came to meet the Minister and he were not satisfied with what they said, he might say that ultimately it is the Government's decision.</P>

        <Quest>the plans he has to deal with those people on the farm retirement scheme who will lose out under the changes proposed in the mid-term review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4978/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is involved in working groups and is in continuing discussions with the European Commission on the detailed rules for implementing the mid-term review agreement. While it may be some time before the position is clear, I have already raised, and will continue to raise, a number of issues relating to farmers who have retired under the early retirement schemes, and the implications for them of decoupling and the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The legal position regarding the single payment system, as laid down in the Council regulation, is that entitlements are not linked to land but to farmers who were active producers during the reference period and remain active farmers in 2005. A farmer who joined the early retirement scheme has undertaken to give up farming <Col N="510"/>permanently and therefore he or she cannot be regarded as a farmer when the time comes to activate single payment entitlements in 2005.</P>
        <P>While retired farmers cannot activate entitlements earned during the reference period, the Commission, following negotiations, indicated that it favours arrangements that will allow family members who take over these holdings to have access to the national reserve. This would include cases in which the land was leased to a non-family member at the time of retirement because a family member, usually a son or daughter, was not yet ready or eligible as a transferee at the time, but subsequently takes over the farm. I will continue to work to secure as favourable an outcome as possible to these and other issues affecting retired farmers, having regard to the legitimate aspirations of the various stakeholders involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate when the full legal text with respect to the Fischler proposals will be decided? How many of those participating in the farm retirement scheme stand to lose out if the final proposal does not include a facility for people who did not transfer to relatives? I am aware that many of those on the scheme who leased to family members will not be affected, but I have received many letters on the issue, as I am sure the Minister has. I note the presence of Deputy Wilkinson who is compiling a report on the issue.</P>
        <P>A system in which a person who enters into an agreement is heavily penalised several years later on the basis of agreed practices is inherently unfair, and let us not pretend people are not being penalised. Does the European Commission have available to it a mechanism which would facilitate those affected by the measures? While I accept that when someone takes a piece of the cake, someone else must forfeit it, is it possible, perhaps through modulation or some other method, to make a once-off payment to members of the scheme who can show they lost out significantly under the system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a precise figure on the number of those affected, but some 10,000 farmers are on the retirement scheme. I expect that the vast majority of them are in a regular position, that is, members of their families took over the farm when they retired. We are probably talking about a couple of thousand people. As I stated, I am in negotiations with technical experts in Brussels with regard to this group.</P>
        <P>As regards the final text, in discussion with Commissioner Fischler on Tuesday, I noted the importance of receiving the final text, which we were promised by Christmas, as quickly as possible. He informed me we should have it by mid-March, in other words, in one month. This is important for everybody concerned because people want to know where they stand with some <Col N="511"/>degree of certainty, which will not be possible until we receive the final version of the legal text.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, we will begin to implement the mid-term review from 1 January next. The Department, therefore, wants entitlements to be issued and appeals heard and so forth before that date.</P>
        <Miles com="ah"/><P>In discussions with the European Commission, the Department secured favourable arrangements for those on the scheme who were not farming during the reference period but subsequently took over the farm. Given that the farmer, as opposed to the farm, receives the entitlement, in the event that a retired farmer let his or her land to somebody else, the person who farmed the land during the reference period will be eligible for the entitlements. We have received a favourable response from the Commissioner with regard to circumstances in which a family member has taken over the family farm subsequent to the reference period. This was one of the main complaints of those on the scheme.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a definition of &ldquo;family member&rdquo;? Does it extend to nieces or nephews? Apart from those on the farm retirement scheme, many more people stand to lose, particularly those along the western seaboard who sold weanlings and so forth. Does the Minister have any proposals on behalf of this group? Did he receive many submissions on this issue under the <i>force majeure </i>clause, for which the closing date was a couple of weeks ago? Do many people in this category stand to lose out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>While we have not yet received the legal detailed text, we understand the term &ldquo;family member&rdquo; refers to immediate family members. We will not know for certain, however, until we receive a copy of the text in about four weeks. I will provide the Deputy with a copy immediately.</P>
        <P>With regard to others who may be affected &mdash; I will answer a question on <i>force majeure</i> later &mdash; we intend to deal with this matter quickly because it must be addressed as part of our preparations for the implementation of the mid-term review on 1 January next.</P>

	<P>The deadline for receipt of tenders for the <Col N="512"/>incineration of 172,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal held since the BSE crises in late 2000 was 28 November 2003. Tenders were received from 18 companies in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland. Following a detailed assessment of the tenders, three proposals emerged as best, in being most economically advantageous and meeting the conditions of the published criteria.</P>
        <P>Following discussions with my Department, one contract has been concluded and two more are nearing finalisation. The removal of material under the first contract started this week and it is expected that most of the material will have been removed and incinerated in the United Kingdom and Germany by the end of 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on the tenders submitted from Ireland? I was not aware we were in a position to make such a tender and would be interested to receive further details about it. The Minister of State cited an amount of 172,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal. In a previous reply, he indicated the total amount of meat and bonemeal in storage was approximately 210,000 tonnes. Is it correct that the shortfall of 38,000 tonnes is not under the control of the Department? What plans are there for its disposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the first question, 18 tenders were received from all over Europe, including from several Irish companies. The tendering process was detailed and involved two rounds of negotiations with potential customers at which price and the cost to the State were discussed. As a result, three companies were selected. Contracts have not yet been signed with two companies, while the other company commenced operations this week.</P>
        <P>As regards the second question on the balance of meat and bonemeal, as the Deputy will be aware, the process was transferred to the rendering companies in November 2003 when the Department divested itself from involvement in it, as had always been envisaged. The meat and bonemeal currently in storage is the responsibility of the companies, as agreed with the rendering industry at the time. It is possible that some of the companies in question may be waiting for a reduction in the price of incineration but its disposal remains their responsibility, and not that of the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State mean we are talking about incineration of this product in Ireland if that should arise in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not mean that to be the interpretation and that is certainly not the case. Some of this meat and bonemeal has also been exported by the rendering companies to landfill sites in the North of Ireland. There is no domestic <Col N="513"/>provision for the disposal because of the nature of the operation.</P>

        <Quest>if oral hearings will be set up to deal with appeals under the <i>force majeure</i> clause for farmers who fail in their written submissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>As of now, under the single payment scheme, some 136,000 farmers will qualify for payment of &euro;1.3 billion annually out of the national envelope. The Department is processing applications from 14,000 farmers who have requested that <i>force majeure</i> &mdash; exceptional circumstances be taken into consideration so that they too may be allocated single payment entitlement or at a higher level than that which they currently qualify for from the &euro;1.3 billion envelope. Any person dissatisfied with the decision of the Department on <i>force majeure</i> &mdash; exceptional circumstances in their case will have the right to appeal.</P>
        <P>Where following the application of <i>force majeure</i> &mdash; exceptional circumstances the sum of entitlements for all farmers exceeds the national envelope of &euro;1.3 billion, a linear percentage reduction will have to be applied to all farmers. I am considering the appeals mechanism that can be put in place for those farmers. The primary objective in all these matters is to ensure fairness and impartiality leading to the smooth implementation of the single payment scheme in 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and wish him well in his quest for greener pastures in a few months' time. A mechanism needs to be put in place to help farmers who have been forced to retire prematurely through no fault of their own. They may now be denied payments and their written submissions may be refused. It is not too much to ask that there should be a system to afford them an oral hearing. I do not believe many will be turned down. Will the Minister of State ensure that every case is examined on its merits and sympathetically in some cases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that this will be an open and transparent operation. The objective of the Department is to ensure that every person receives fair play. Like the Deputy, Members also meet varying cases at their weekly clinics and we are aware of the issue. The Minister has decided that an independent appeals committee will be established to process in a fair, comprehensive and efficient manner appeals on all aspects of the single payment regime.</P>
        <P>A committee to be known as the single payment appeals committee will be established. This is a separate committee and will comprise four appeals officers attached to the agricultural <Col N="514"/>office in Portlaoise and an independent chairperson. The committee will meet in Portlaoise initially. It is proposed that the committee should meet for one day a week commencing in mid-March, but this will be subject to review and it may have to expand during the summer due to the number of appeals that have been received by the Department.</P>
        <P>At the outset, the appeals committee will examine cases of farmers whose applications for <i>force majeure</i> were unsuccessful. It will take into consideration the situation of farmers depending on the number of animals, area applied for during the reference period, or other circumstances such as bad health, illness or animal disease. The Department has already received more than 14,000 applications and the Deputy can appreciate the difficulty in processing all those. It is hoped that the initial decisions will be made in early March. I assure the Deputy that each individual applicant will receive the fullest consideration. I remind the Deputy that, whatever decisions might be made in that regard, there will be an adjustment under the &euro;1.3 billion national package.</P>

        <Quest>if he will make a statement on the implications which the opening up of the EU to genetically modified produce will have on agriculture here.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In Ireland responsibility for GM foods comes under the Minister for Health and Children while responsibility for the deliberate release of GM crops into the environment rests with the Environmental Protection Agency. The Department of Agriculture and Food is the competent authority relating to the cultivation of these crops.</P>
        <P>As a result of consumer concerns within the EU about GM produce, there have been significant developments over the past two years in strengthening the controls governing the approval, cultivation and use of GM products. The legislation governing the assessment and approval procedures for GM crops, food and feed will ensure that the highest standards are in place to protect the citizens of the Community from a food safety and environmental aspect. New legislation on labelling and traceability for all GM food and feed, which will apply from 18 April next, will ensure that consumers can continue to have choice and full confidence in the food supply chain.</P>
        <P>In addition to this legislation, which was jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, the Community has also established the European Food Safety Authority which provides the citizens of the EU with an independent <Col N="515"/>scientific body in which they can have the utmost confidence and trust with regard to the assessment, advice and communication of any risk associated with GM foods or any food safety matter.</P>
        <P>To establish the appropriate measures necessary for Irish farming practices and farming conditions, I have established an interdepartmental and inter-agency working group with the task of identifying and evaluating the issues and implications for crop production in Ireland that would arise from the cultivation of GM crops, and developing proposals for a national strategy and best practices to ensure the co-existence of GM crops with conventional and organic farming.</P>
        <P>The combination of these measures is aimed at ensuring the GM crops cultivated have been subjected to the most rigorous scientific testing available within the EU before approval; obliging farmers who wish to cultivate GM crops to do so under strict conditions which will not affect the farming practices of their neighbours; and ensuring that the consumer will have choice of GM or non-GM products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht an fhreagra sin. I am a little amazed at that answer. It is like closing the door when the horse has bolted. Does the Minister agree that the image this island enjoys internationally as a source of high quality food produce will be endangered if the EU member states continue to introduce genetically modified food products? Does he also agree that Irish officials voting in favour of the introduction of GM products, as they have done twice in recent months, is against the long-term interests of Irish farming and the food processing industry?</P>
        <P>We ought to develop the full potential of Irish agriculture to produce high quality produce, and this includes the organic sector. We should stay away from GM products and this is possible for an island nation. That is where the strength and the future of Irish agriculture should be. There is proposed legislation to protect the consumer. Given that the EU has already voted, with the support of Irish officials, to introduce genetic modification, that legislation would seem to be too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Morgan, a substantial amount of farm feed entering the Community consists of GM crops such as soya. There is a moratorium on the cultivation of GM crops within the European Union. In the past two years, a series of legislative measures have been introduced to address concerns of consumers and citizens of the EU. This is rigorous legislation which has been adopted not alone by the EU Council of Ministers but also by co-decision with the European Parliament. The measures, which are binding rather than optional across all member states, set out rules governing the release <Col N="516"/>of genetically modified organisms into the environment. The GM food and feed regulation, No. 1829 of 2003, sets out the authorisation procedure for labelling and traceability of genetically modified foods and feed. A range of regulations and protocols protects consumers and ensures that they know where they stand.</P>
        <P>Deputy Morgan also referred to the sweetcorn maize product, Bt-11. When the product was considered by a regulatory committee, Ireland voted in favour of it. There is a long way to go before a final decision is taken on the matter, which is due to come before EU Ministers at a meeting of the Health Council, the Environment Council or the Agriculture Council. That decision has not yet been taken and the Commission has not yet made a proposal in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the regulation will be binding across every member state. My problem is that our officials are supporting and voting in favour of the introduction of such measures, rather than opposing them. Regardless of the many safety aspects of genetic modification, does the Minister agree that there is no economic argument in favour of introducing genetic modification, other than assisting large corporations to further monopolise the market? Irish farming and food production will be much better served if we ensure that genetic modification is not introduced on this island. Our officials should be told that any voting power we have at EU level should be directed in opposition to the introduction of genetic modification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The approach to genetic modification taken in this country is generally conservative and cautious. The report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology, which was produced in October 2000, established the Government's precautionary position on biotechnology. This position was based on the undoubted potential of biotechnology in the fields of medicine and health. A considerable proportion of the animal feed, particularly soya, imported into this country is genetically modified, but we are extremely careful. We have supported various measures and regulations that have been introduced in respect of labelling and the development of GMs, generally, within the European Union. Our attitude is that the marketing of GM products should be allowed within the community only in exceptional circumstances. Our attitude to cultivation is even more conservative. It has rightly been pointed out that we have a positive image as a food-producing country and we want to retain it. There is a role for biotechnology, however, especially in the field of medicine and we think it should be cautiously allowed to develop.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if he has any proposals to include the 7.1 million gallons of milk quota, received under Agenda 2000, for decoupled payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to facilitate Deputy Hayes in this regard. The total compensation available to Ireland under the dairy cow premium and national envelope is based on the level of the national milk quota in the base year 1999-2000. Ireland's quota includes an additional 32 million gallons, or 150,000 tonnes, which was negotiated under Agenda 2000 and has been allocated to the various categories. As Ireland was allowed to allocate this quota from the earliest date, the cumulative level of individual quotas needs to be adjusted to the level of the overall quota before the 2000 allocation, in the base year 1999-2000, for the purpose of calculating the dairy premium. I am considering the most equitable way of achieving this adjustment, while taking account of the status of producers who received allocations from the Agenda 2000 quota. I hope to make a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I thank the Chair for allowing this important question to be answered. Will the Minister take into account the views of those who have campaigned long and hard for an extra quota, many of whom are genuinely committed to the future of rural Ireland and family farms?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We were fortunate to receive the additional allocation of milk because it tidied up a number of difficult cases, some of which had lasted for years, as the Deputy said. The regulations will not allow the dairy cow premium to extend to that additional milk. The 7.1 million gallons of milk quota, which were mentioned by the Deputy, extend only to quotas established before 2000. The vast bulk of our quota will qualify, however. The relatively small amount of 150,000 tonnes, of a total of 5,250,000 tonnes, will not qualify. We would prefer if the dairy cow premium was attached to it, but the detailed rules will not allow that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Minister is saying and where he is coming from in his response. In view of the fact that a small number of people, most of whom are young or development farmers, is affected, is it possible that a special case could again be made? I appreciate that the Minister understands the problem &mdash; I have no difficulty with that &mdash; but will he try to find another way to facilitate those <Col N="518"/>who are affected by it, in conjunction with the Commission or whoever is responsible for it?</P>

	<P>Senior officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food have been in Brussels in recent weeks teasing out various details of the mid-term review with representatives of the European Commission. I said that we hope to get the final text in about four weeks. Many issues, such as the availability of land, are under examination. Will those who have to lease land on quota during the reference period have to continue to lease that land into the future? We are making progress in a number of such critical areas and it is important that we continue to do so because the mid-term review of reform of the CAP will be in place for the next ten or 12 years. We want to ensure that we achieve the most favourable outcome possible from the negotiations. I have the utmost confidence that the departmental officials in Brussels will get the best possible deal from the Commission.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance. A draft action programme giving effect to the directive, which was prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, was presented to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders in December 2003. A period of two months, which was provided for stakeholders to submit their comments on the document in writing to either or both Departments runs until tomorrow, 19 February 2004.

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that the nitrates directive is the single biggest issue being discussed in agricultural circles at the moment? It is of huge concern to farmers in our part of the country and elsewhere. As the Minister for Agriculture and Food is responsible for ensuring that farming continues in a viable manner, does he accept that the closure period, whereby farmers would not be able to spread any slurry for three and a half months in the year, is not a workable proposal for practical farms? It may make sense in other European countries where the ground may be frozen for two to three months of the year. However, in Ireland, with the long growing season, it is an unsuitable measure. What are the Minister's views on that?</P>
        <P>The second issue of concern is the proposal for storage capacity that farmers will be required to have in their yards, as a result of this long closure period. The majority of farmers would accept, though they will not say it officially, closure for one month a year, say in December. However, expecting farmers to have storage for 16 weeks in the south, 20 weeks in the midlands and west and 24 weeks in the north-west will make commercial farming non-viable in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The nitrates directive has been in place for 13 years. The time has come for the matter to be addressed due to environmental and legal reasons. Ireland is currently before the European Court and a judgment is due in the coming weeks. There is no option, legally or otherwise, but to address this 1991 directive. It has been put on the long finger for too long. I am not apportioning any blame, as I am as much to blame as anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is more to blame than anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In the directive, there is a limit of 170 kg. per hectare. The draft Irish proposal has asked for a limit of 250 kg. per hectare. Hopefully by tomorrow, the stakeholders, the farming organisations and others will have responded to the draft proposal. The final proposal will then be sent to Brussels. The main aim is to get derogation on the limit up to 250 kg. The majority of farmers will be excluded by this limit and will not have problems with it.</P>
        <P>The closure period for the application of fertiliser on land is based on the 1996 code of good farming practice document, which the farming bodies were involved in drawing up. Teagasc is directly involved with individual farmers in drawing up inventories of the capacity requirements of their farms, called the Farm Facilities Survey. With good planning in this area, this matter can be ameliorated too.</P>
        <P>It is most important to address this problem environmentally and legally. The substantial net payments that Ireland receives are being jeopardised because of non-compliance with this directive. I appreciate some of the difficulties <Col N="520"/>with this directive. However, they are not insurmountable and, with good forward planning, they can be implemented with the derogations sought and at the minimum cost to farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>For the last year, we have listened to the term &ldquo;freedom to farm&rdquo;. However, at the first hurdle, the situation is more draconian than any other previous red tape situation. Would the Minister agree that if the proposals remain in their current form, they will reduce the options open for those in the dairy industry in particular who were told to either upsize to stand still, get more land, decrease production or forgo single farm payments? Does the Minister believe there is a chance of securing an increase on the 170 kg. level? Does he believe the 250 kg. or 210 kg. level will be agreed? Has he looked at the concept of nitrogen vulnerable zones rather than an all-country classification? Does he agree that there is scope for looking at such a system and if not, why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that Northern Ireland has successfully applied for a derogation, allowing Northern Irish farmers to apply 250 kg. of organic nitrogen per hectare? If so, why should there be difficulties in the South? Is the Minister blaming farmers and farming organisations for the length of the proposed closure period because they recommended it through good practice proposals? If he is, I am not hearing that from farming organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree with Teagasc's draft action programme that provides for storage periods at individual farm levels less than the specified minimum periods where it can be demonstrated that it is consistent with reducing pollution potential? In other words, there is an opening for reducing the amount. Does the Minister agree that these proposals will involve a significant, in some cases insurmountable, expense for farmers if they have to provide such storage facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister claims that the majority of farmers will not be affected by these proposals. Will the Department, however, spearhead the roll-out of anaerobic digestion programmes given their successful application in reducing nitrate problems on land? Can the Department look at the efficient management of nutrients more proactively, rather than simply saying it aims to reduce nitrates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many ways of proactively addressing this problem. One of the reasons farmers are advised not to put out nitrogen for a number of weeks is that grass growth may not be as vigorous in those months as in others. If grass growth is vigorous it absorbs the nitrogen; otherwise it is leached off into rivers and streams.</P>
        <P>A proposal must be submitted to Brussels before a derogation will be considered as the <Col N="521"/>Commission cannot consider the situation until it receives a proposal. Tomorrow is the final day for responses from stakeholders and farming organisations. The proposal will be submitted to Brussels and I am confident that a limit of up to 250 kg. per hectare, like in Northern Ireland, will be achieved. Denmark received a derogation of up to 230 kg. per hectare. However, these derogations were only considered when the applications were made.</P>
        <P>With regard to storage capacity and anaerobic digestion, individual farmers can make a case to the competent authority, which is the local authority, and get a derogation for whatever system they have. The Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with the farming organisations, signed up to the 1996 protection of waters from pollution by nitrates directive. It is not a figment of anyone's imagination.</P>
        <P>It was okay to sign up in 1996 because it was felt it would never see the light of day. However, Ireland is now before the courts, 13 years after the 1991 directive. Up to 100,000 farmers are below the 170 kg. per hectare limit. Up to another 6,000 farmers will be excluded if the 210 kg. is set as the limit. Another 2,500 farmers will be excluded at 230 kg. per hectare. Almost all farmers would be excluded if the limit was 250 kg. per hectare.</P>
        <P>Last year the Department was asked for additional money for the REPS and we got an additional &euro;70 million. We were also asked for additional money for farm waste management systems for which we got a substantial increase, as well as an increase in thresholds in the dairy hygiene regulations to exclude waste and so on. That was in preparation for this nitrates directive. I am confident that we can get the derogations from Brussels which will allow the REPS continue, which is worth &euro;260 million per annum to Irish farmers. Last year the area-based compensatory payment scheme was held up for a number of weeks because we had failed to address the problem of the nitrates directive. In my view, we should send our application to Brussels and then seek the derogations which will make it possible, so there will not be an undue burden on farmers to comply with the directive.</P>

Will the Minister agree that will impose a serious financial burden on those people who fall outside <Col N="522"/>that who have higher applications? Is there any way that the bureaucracy and financial implications can be addressed to alleviate that problem?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was suggested to me that water quality in our rivers is improving at the moment. Is the court case the only reason for the Minister's insistence that we implement the directive at this stage irrespective of the consequences to farmers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed answers. I accept that he will make efforts to get a derogation to move from 170 kg. to 250 kg. but will he also seek a derogation for the closure periods? Does he accept that grass grows in October and sometimes into November? Certainly last winter it did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister please clarify the policy on the nitrogen vulnerable zones? Does he see any opening for those?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the final point, Government policy advocates a national zone. We believe that is the right way to go. The intensive farmers will be most affected by the nitrates directive. In yesterday's <i>Farming Independent</i> the Teagasc expert on dairying showed that a person with 100 acres, or 40 hectares, of land can produce up to 104,000 gallons from that land and still remain within the 210 kg per hectare limit. Good farming practice is essential.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Coveney, I accept that grass grows in winter months. There is no month of the year in the benign constituency that Deputy O'Keeffe and I represent  when we do not cut our lawns and have chores to do around the garden because there is growth virtually all year round.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make those points to Brussels in that context too. In response to Deputy Upton, we are not serious offenders in regard to over-application of nitrogen and phosphates. Nevertheless, there is some pollution of our streams and rivers which are an important asset that we must maintain. With good farming practice there is no need for the level of application we have in many instances. It has been shown, for example, that very few farmers carry out soil analysis to see exactly the amount of fertilisation needed for their soil. It comes down to sensible, good farming practice and for that reason, apart from the legal implications of the court case and the vulnerability of our very large payments under REPS and other schemes, if we do not comply with the directive, they too will be affected. For good environmental reasons it is important that we comply with this directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I have answered this as a priority question. At present meat and bonemeal is being produced at a rate of 2,500 tonnes per week, which is 125,000 tonnes per annum, in Ireland. In the main, this is exported expeditiously for incineration abroad. Of the commercially owned stocks of meal in store, it is estimated that the material awaiting disposal totals nearly 46,000 tonnes. The cost of disposing of the residual 172,000 tonnes of meal stored in Ireland since the BSE crisis of 2001 will total &euro;24 million. This was the subject of an EU-wide tender adjudicated last December. This material will begin to be moved abroad for incineration this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister of State risk making any predictions on the future stocks of meat and bonemeal and how he sees that shaping up in the coming years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>The good news story is that the level of BSE has dropped dramatically over recent years, proving that the policy adopted at the insistence of the European Union has been successful and hopefully Ireland will soon be free of BSE. The problem will always have a tail but the figures speak for themselves. I do not have the exact figures before me now but previous parliamentary questions show that the graph is going in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister of State can see the future but does he envisage a time when meat and bonemeal may revert to its previous use as a very important soil additive, or has that day gone since the BSE crisis? Meanwhile, is he aware of the very deep concerns expressed by communities, for example in Edenderry in Offaly, which are very unhappy about the prospective plans to burn meat and bonemeal in their area? Has he considered whether other technologies about which I have previously asked, such as alkaline hydrolysis or whatever, are worthy of consideration, particularly as the EU steering committee has passed this technology for non-hazardous meat and bonemeal?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is in my new constituency. I hope we can some day use meat and bonemeal which is a very valuable resource. However, I do not wish to speculate on that. Deputy Sargent has several times raised the question of alternative methods of disposal of animal by-products, as has Deputy Upton. Certain regulations are allowed by the EU animal by-products regulation whereby certain processes can be used in the treatment of animal by-products. The Deputy referred specifically to alkaline hydrolysis and the Minister has answered questions here to that effect, stating that he would like to see the day when that might happen. The process involves treating the animal by-products in an alkaline solution at 150 degrees Celsius for up to six hours in a sealed container.</P>
        <P>Several issues must be addressed, particularly the large volume of highly alkalised solution produced during the process which, in turn, even following further treatment, would have to be disposed of possibly by incineration or co-incineration. There is doubt about its effectiveness in the disposal of a mass powdery material such as meat and bonemeal. It has not been tested adequately for this purpose. Alkaline hydrolysis may in future offer a viable alternative to the rendering of some animal by-products. We would all love to see that day, but there is a long way to go in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any research been done on ways, other than incineration, of disposing of meat and bonemeal? Is material from Northern Ireland being disposed of in landfills in the South of Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no material being disposed of in the South of Ireland. A substantial amount of meat and bonemeal is exported to landfill in Northern Ireland. However, that is a decision for the people there. The only option open to the Department and the rendering companies is to move it abroad for incineration. It is a valuable product which is used in France, Germany and other countries for road and bridge building and as a fertiliser following incineration. We will have a debate on this issue in future. Our position is that it must be exported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister know the weekly cost to the Department of storing such material? He may not have the figures with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the figures with me. The storage costs to Ireland are for the 172,000 tonnes which built up over the years. Since last year the responsibility has been handed to the rendering companies. There is no <Col N="525"/>additional cost at present. We hope to move that 172,000 tonnes from the country by the end of 2004, which would result in no cost to the Department of Agriculture and Food. The cost is approximately &euro;24 million for storage and &euro;146 million for disposal.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the position in relation to commonage here; the total area involved; and his policy approach to the division thereof.</Quest>
        <QRef>[5039/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>The area of land held in common throughout the country is estimated to be in excess of 500,000 hectares. For the most part, this land is privately owned and, as with other privately owned land, decisions affecting its structure are a matter for the owners or shareholders. The Department provided for some time a commonage division and re-arrangement service, but this was discontinued in 1998 following a review of its operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested to know why the practice was discontinued. What was the policy behind that decision? I am surprised there is so much commonage. The Minister's figures seem to suggest there are more than 1 million acres of commonage. What is the Government's view on commonage and disease control? Is the existence of such a large amount of commonage considered helpful from the point of view of disease control or is the inevitable inter-mixing of animals considered to be a factor in that regard? Is the Government adopting a policy of neutrality on the issue of division?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is aware that much of this work was carried out by the Land Commission for a long number of years. It provided technical and legal assistance free of charge to farmers who wished to divide commonage land into individually held plots or to carry out a voluntary exchange of plots of land to improve the layout of their farms. The experience in my constituency was limited, but it was a headache for the Department and people, including public representatives, in the west, for example.</P>
        <P>In 1998 the Department took the decision to withdraw from voluntary commonage division but to complete, where possible, cases which were already in hand. There was a combination of factors which led to the decision to terminate this service. These included a lack of staff resources for commonage division work which resulted in an unsatisfactory level for other farmers, and participation in REPS, which will answer the Deputy's question about disease control, because it was considered to be a more environmentally acceptable solution to the problem of overgrazing than the division of commonage. The demand for commonage partition reduced considerably <Col N="526"/>following the introduction of REPS because commonage land attracted special payments. Much commonage is not suitable for division due to the nature of the terrain and the need for sheep, in particular, to graze over an extensive terrain.</P>
        <P>Approximately 80% of commonage is mountain commonage and is mainly located in areas known as special areas of conservation. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for these areas. Due to their status as wild, remote and long-established natural places for flora and fauna, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not wish SACs to be harmed or converted to damaging or intensive agricultural usage. The operation of the commonage division or &ldquo;plottery&rdquo; arrangements is not contingent on the involvement of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
        <P>It has always been open to shareholders to arrange privately for the division of their commonage where all were in favour of it. There were good reasons for the Department to exempt itself from being involved. Given the utilisation of resources, Department policy is to allow shareholders to make their own arrangements about commonage division. The level of personnel required and the expense which a wholesale scheme of sub-division would impose on the taxpayer are also important considerations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Minister of State's reply that this is an extension of the Government's principle of neutrality because it is allowing the issue to remain as it is. Perhaps that is the right approach. There are advantages from the point of view of REPS and mountain sheep grazing. However, I am concerned about disease control. Does the Minister of State accept there may be a problem with disease control when cattle mix on commonage? How can that be addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>It is usually sheep which graze on most of the commonage of which I am aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but it is not always only sheep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be exceptional. Cattle are controlled in the normal way. The Department has strict controls. I dealt with a case recently where two farmers from the same family tried to operate together in a commonage area with cattle and the Department imposed strict regulations.</P>
        <P>As regards REPS, the number of sheep on commonage has been significantly reduced. There is an attractive package for farmers if they avail of REPS. However, part of the deal is that they must take the sheep from the mountains. The position has improved considerably from <Col N="527"/>what it was some years ago. That reflects other factors, such as the level of controls imposed.</P>
        <P>The CMMS measures and other tracking and traceability systems mean there is not a problem with cattle. I am not aware of any cases where it has happened. The opposite is so in the cases I have dealt with in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My experience of commonage issues relates to Ring commons in north County Dublin, otherwise known as the Bog of the Ring. Is it possible to take any action against dumping on commonage, which is a problem, or illegally fencing it off in the hope that such action will not be contested? Is the Department aware of that issue? Does it have advice for people who can legitimately use the commonage areas but are thwarted from doing so either by illegal dumping or fencing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamAylward"><NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the matters to which the Deputy refers, but I understand his point. That is a matter for the local authority and D&uacute;chas. If the Deputy gives me the details, I will be happy to follow the matter up with these organizations.</P>
        <P>A section of the Land Act 1939 makes provision for fencing, but it is a very complicated process. If the Deputy gives me the details I will come back to him with a response on that matter.</P>

        <Quest>his plans to protect the Irish poultry industry from cheap imports of chicken from non-EU countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with WTO arrangements, imports of poultry meat from non-EU countries may enter the EU and be sold on the EU market. It is, however, a condition of entry that meat must comply with EU veterinary and hygiene standards. In particular, the EU Commission must approve the country of origin and the establishment in which the product was produced in advance of importation. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the animal health status of the country, the adequacy of its veterinary structures, the facilities of the production establishment and employment of hygiene practices. Third country food processing establishments intending to export to the EU are inspected by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission and where they do not meet the required standards the export licence is removed.</P>
        <P>Consumers have the right to the maximum amount of information about the food they are offered for sale so they can make informed choices about their purchases. With that in mind, the Deputy will be aware that I recently made two statutory instruments concerning the labelling of poultry meat. In introducing these <Col N="528"/>regulations, I took account of the recommendations of the food labelling group and also the findings of a recent consumer survey I commissioned to ascertain consumer preferences regarding labelling. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, and condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat to be provided to the consumer. Heretofore, while these labelling indications have been compulsory for pre-packaged poultry meat, it had not been a requirement to provide this information for poultry meat sold loose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt><Miles com="ah"/>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer. While I particularly welcome the labelling <Miles com="ch"/>requirement, there seems to have been a knee-jerk reaction. Every time there is a crisis we have a fire brigade action. I welcome the establishment of the food labelling group and its recommendations. However, we only had an immediate and prompt response because of the outbreak of <Miles com="ch"/>avian influenza. I would like to see a considerably more pro-active approach to labelling and information on food products in general.</P>
        <P>As there is a significant cost factor, the Irish processor, restaurateur and those manufacturing other value-added products are much more likely to import cheap poultry meat. How could the promotion of Irish poultry products be enhanced to encourage people to buy home produced product where we have a clear track record in traceability that is much more tangible than for products from third countries?</P><Miles com="xh"/>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Unusually, Deputy Upton is being a little hard on the Department. I established the food labelling group in 2000, which was long before the outbreak of avian influenza in Thailand. Last year I initiated a consumer survey to determine consumer attitudes to food labelling. The food labelling group made 36 recommendations, which I have implemented in so far as I could. For example, the Food Safety Authority is now a one-stop shop for the enforcement of regulations. Previously the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment helped the Department of Agriculture and Food and a multiplicity of Departments had some responsibility.</P>
        <P>While I would like to see the issue of beef for consumption in restaurants and the catering industry addressed at the earliest opportunity, it is beyond my reach. It is a matter for the Commission to ensure that people know the origin of beef on menus in various catering establishments. The Commission has promised a report on this matter by March. I hope we will be able to also address this matter, as the vast majority of consumers want to know the origin of <Col N="529"/>food they purchase whether in retail outlets or catering establishments.</P>
        <P>The Irish poultry industry is sizeable and concentrated. It exports about &euro;120 million of produce per annum. As we produce about 140,000 tonnes, it is well worth promoting. I agree with the Deputy in that it needs to use the most up-to-date technology and offer consumer cuts and the most convenient products possible. The industry is subject to imports that are relatively cheaper than Irish produce. However, the vast majority of consumers would like to get Irish poultry if they could get it in a convenient way.</P>
        <P>We import about 46,000 tonnes, which is controlled by rigorous regulation. I agree with the Deputy that the industry needs to be given assistance and I will raise the matter with Enterprise Ireland, which is the relevant body for supporting and developing the industry here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>When I spoke of a fire brigade action, I meant that labelling was introduced within about a week of the avian influenza outbreak. I do not believe I am being harsh on the Department in mentioning that fact. The legislation can be introduced rapidly when we appear to have a crisis. Otherwise we sit back and wait for something to happen.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate it is not the Minister's responsibility, is he satisfied that the Food and Veterinary Office is provided with sufficient resources? Is he happy with the level of resources available and with the level of inspection in third countries? Following the avian influenza outbreak it became clear that we also needed to highlight animal welfare issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is very pro-active on food safety and was one of the first European Union countries to establish a food safety authority. In line with demand that this be independent of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farming sector, it is under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. There was no scare prior to my establishing the food labelling group as I felt it important to have labelling for safety reasons, to outline the possible presence of allergens and to address the accuracy of claims on some labels, which are occasionally outrageous. These matters are now being addressed. Most people would agree that it is very objective and doing an excellent job. I will take the suggestions made by the Deputy to see how we can further enhance the safety of food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that we have very rigorous regulations. Would he agree that many consumers purchase items believing them to be Irish? In many cases this is not so, due to deceptive labelling. While I welcome his initiative on labelling and his mission statement for the EU Presidency that he would seek to enhance labelling measures, would he agree that the Food and Veterinary Office was very slow off the mark following the outbreak of avian influenza in <Col N="530"/>Thailand? There was word of avian influenza on the street among traders in Thailand last December. However, the EU only took action after Japan banned the import of chicken. This approach leaves much to be desired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister agree that the outbreak of avian influenza has focused minds on the EU's battery hen directive? Would he agree that it might bring forward its implementation given the warning about intensive rearing of poultry? Would the Minister be able to emulate outlets in Britain such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Waitrose, which have strong &ldquo;buy British&rdquo; campaigns? Is there anything in law preventing us from being as strident about Irish poultry products here, which could assure the public that they can buy Irish produce that is clearly labelled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the FVO, Deputy Upton also asked whether I was satisfied that it is adequately resourced and staffed. The information I have from the EU is that it has sufficient resources and staff and that it closely monitors establishments outside the EU and ports of entry into EU countries, including Ireland. We must take its assurances at face value.</P>
        <P>The matter of labelling has become considerably more important. The food labelling group which I established in 2000 has been extremely helpful in this regard. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has done a superb job in giving confidence to consumers. In the matter of poultry meat, we are always faced with a problem. Within the EU, we export 1.5 times as much poultry meat as we import. It is an important trading operation. Nonetheless, Irish poultry meat is strongly promoted. When it comes to tendering for supply to retailers and establishments, including hospitals and prisons, the lowest tenderer must get the contract as long as the meat is supplied by an EU country.</P>
        <P>It can be confusing for consumers where there has been re-working of products within a European country, in other words, where a product is imported from a third country and re-worked within the country that is labelled as its country of origin. About a year ago it was discovered that poultry imported to Ireland from Holland contained non-poultry proteins. It was quite safe to eat, but nonetheless it had been reworked. We must be vigilant to ensure that labelling is accurate and contains no false claims. The labelling of the country of origin and the establishment in which the product is produced must be adhered to along the chain of supply. Consumers must be assured of that.</P>

	<P>In 1999 I established an advisory committee to advise on the role of women in agriculture and rural communities. The advisory committee's report, published in September 2000, contained 36 recommendations covering a broad range of policy and operational areas. While recognising the contribution of women to agriculture, it is clear from an analysis of the recommendations that the advisory committee's central concerns were issues affecting women in rural communities more generally.</P>
        <P>Some of the recommendations of the report were overtaken by a range of developments, including the establishment of the national rural development forum which meets in open session twice a year and provides a forum for continued attention to many of the issues raised in the report. It should also be noted that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established. Notwithstanding the change in remit of my Department, the advisory committee's recommendations have been pursued by my Department and a comprehensive progress report on the recommendations relevant to Departments and agencies has been finalised. This provides ample evidence that the recommendations have been fully taken into account by all the relevant Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>In leading the development of agriculture my objectives include the retention of the maximum number of farm families and ensuring that farming is an attractive career option for young people generally. Policies pursued by my Department are geared towards achieving these objectives. The schemes operated by my Department do not discriminate on grounds of gender. I also note that farm and community organisations have been provided with more than &euro;500,00 under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to promote female participation and representation. I am disappointed that there has as yet been no nomination of women by any of the farm organisations for appointment to the boards of statutory bodies operating under the aegis of my Department. Taking these factors together I am not convinced that the establishment of a dedicated unit dealing exclusively with the role of women in agriculture is necessary.</P>

On the matter of gender balance, I remind the Minister of what was said in a recent publication of the Department. There is example after example of references to the farmer and &ldquo;his&rdquo; <Col N="532"/>land, &ldquo;his&rdquo; pension, and &ldquo;his&rdquo; rights and a description of how the farmer leaves the land to &ldquo;his son&rdquo;. This does not imply much progress in terms of gender balance. We should recognise that women have an important role.</P>
        <P>However, other substantial issues need to be addressed. There is the matter of access to herd numbers. The Department recommended the formation of partnerships, but setting up or establishing a partnership in farming in rural Ireland can often be difficult. Does the Minister think some incentives should be put in place to help promote this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy's points. I would like to see the improvement of all the Departments' regulations and schemes so that we do not see this type of terminology. In particular, we should avoid derogatory terminology such as &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; when referring to a real person in a family.</P>
        <P>There are examples of where partnerships and joint ownership can be promoted in farming. I will investigate to what extent this can be done. I know, for example, that in recent years farmers have been obliged to make revenue and social insurance payments, which is a good thing. They are entitled to a contributory pension as a result. However, this contribution system is for the head of the household. The unfortunate woman of the house is regarded as an adult dependant when it comes to her pension and must make do with a non-contributory pension. This problem could be alleviated by joint ownership. Throughout the legal system provision should be made for partnerships, joint ownership, joint herd numbers and so on to ensure there is equal treatment for husbands and wives in rural areas. The current system can lead to humiliation, especially in published literature. It also results in unfairness in social welfare schemes. I will take the Deputy's points into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that I have had time to reflect on my contribution, I would like to clarify some matters and bring my contribution to a conclusion. A pertinent point was raised about the report the Minister said he received from the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of Aer Lingus. I asked the Minister what was the nature of the report. I formed the impression, when I referred to a written report, that he nodded his head. Will the Minister confirm whether the report was a written one?</P>
      <P>The kernel of this is to try to ensure the best future for Aer Lingus. Despite what the Minister has said, I do not believe it is necessary to privatise the company. The difficulty for me, the people working in the company and the public is that the Minister, as he said this afternoon, has not yet made up his mind. On the one hand, he is considering the matter and can be convinced one way or the other but, on the other hand, his stated objective is to propose the privatisation of Aer Lingus. According to media reports, the <Col N="534"/>Minister believes this is the direction the company should go. He now says, however, he is pulling back from that position and is having the issue reviewed.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a Mr. Hooper whom he has asked to provide a consultant's report on the various options that might be available to him. What riding instructions, to use racing parlance, did the Minister give to Mr. Hooper when he asked him to carry out this investigation? The Minister does not have a great record for implementing consultants' reports, particularly when they do not tally with what he wants. Two or three reports on Aer Rianta have been produced by eminent people who have recommended against the establishment of three separate companies or the privatisation of the company. The Minister disregarded the reports and sought other reports. This issue will come again before the D&aacute;il for its consideration. What terms of reference did the Minister give Mr. Hooper? Is the Minister confirming that he has an open mind on Aer Lingus?</P>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 6. It has not been proved that it is necessary to privatise Aer Lingus. The organisation has pulled itself up by its bootstraps to become an efficient organisation with a super management team. That team has done excellent work in pulling together the elements required to make the company a viable organisation that will go from strength to strength. It is already making significant profits and, hopefully, will make more in future. I hope everybody involved in this, including the board, will move to the next stage with an open mind and not be directed by the ideological attitude of the Minister and some of his colleagues in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my constituency colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan, I support amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 6. Unfortunately, the Government seems to be guilty of short-term thinking about the future of Aer Lingus. Whereas a considerable amount of pain has been endured by staff over the years to ensure the ability of the company to compete with any competition the market can throw at it, the Government seems to have a blind spot about the long-term need to have a State airline. Aer Lingus has fulfilled that role for many years.</P>
      <P>One of the long-term considerations that is too often overlooked, probably because it is too difficult to contemplate, is that the supply of fossil fuels in general will be more difficult to guarantee in the future. Over Christmas I did a considerable amount of reading on this subject. The year 2010 is envisaged internationally as the peak production year for fossil fuels worldwide. This follows similar analysis which was carried out on US oil production, which peaked in 1970 and probably explains some of the more aggressive foreign policy adventures of the American Administration to guarantee supplies for the <Col N="535"/>American economy. In the UK, gas production peaked in 2000. This is not to say there will not be supplies of fossil fuels for a number of decades in the future but that the supplies are more difficult to guarantee.</P>
      <P>A State airline is vital infrastructure for national security. It is flawed and irresponsible thinking on the part of the Government to believe it is possible to privatise Aer Lingus and still ensure this island economy will be able to continue to operate in the way we take for granted. It is a real possibility that if Aer Lingus were privatised and not accountable to the Government or the people, we could end up with services from this country that would, effectively, be hopping to Britain or Europe for hub services. There would be nothing like the service we currently take for granted or the type of service that is essential for our economy, which is already completely open and vulnerable to global trends and, to add to that vulnerability, poorly off in terms of fuel security.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to take the broader view for the sake of the national interest and, indeed, in the interests of Aer Lingus. It should not be drawn into thinking that because Aer Lingus is able to compete, it will manage better in the private sector. The company is well able to compete with any private sector company and, for that reason, the Minister should give an assurance to Aer Lingus that he does not have a policy up his sleeve whereby, when he gets the chance, he will sell the shares to a larger consortium or company. That is the suspicion many people have and it has not been allayed by the Minister, given his previous history and utterances. If the Minister is thinking of the national interest, he will accept amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 6 and not proceed on a slippery slope to privatisation. He should think of the greater national interest, which requires that we have a national airline that will be able to cope on the rocky road ahead and provide the type of transport service to which we have become accustomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Report Stage of the Bill. I do not want to go into a rehearsal of all the issues dealt with on Second or Committee Stage and will just make one or two points in regard to the report. In light of the continuing turn around in the company's finances, last July I asked the chairman of Aer Lingus to examine and report back to me on future options for the company. He furnished that report to me on 16 September 2003. That report put forward the view that a private sector investment process should be initiated and that was the judgment of the chairman and the chief executive. I have not actually queried the process undertaken in the company which resulted in that report. That is a matter for the chairman and his organisation. I <Col N="536"/>consider the report as an important input into the Government's deliberations on the future options of the airline.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I stressed that it would be remiss of me not to look at all of the options for the future of the airline, given that &mdash; as many Deputies said &mdash; this is a volatile and cyclical business. It would also be remiss of me not to take account of the fact that the airline has come close to collapse twice in ten years. On both occasions this House and the taxpayer were not found wanting. A number of issues concern the EU in the future in the event of any fresh demand for capital in what is a cyclical business. Those arguments will be contained in the paper which I will produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How would selling it provide capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>To make it absolutely clear, no decision has been taken by Government to dispose of any shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then is this Bill before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to make it clear that we will &mdash; because of the amendment in subsection (5) &mdash; revert to the House in the event of any proposed sale. The approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be required for the disposal of any shares. If that day arrives, we can discuss these issues in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Some allegations were made about the motives of senior executives. In fairness, I must defend them. I found them nothing but professional and honourable in all their dealings and in any advice they gave the chairman, the board or myself through the chairman. I have no doubt but that their motives are entirely honourable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned the issue of the payments to staff. On many occasions I have paid tribute to the staff in Aer Lingus who worked hard at putting through the survival plan. This morning I said that over 1,000 people had left the airline in the past 12 months. At the same time we also speak for the taxpayer, thanks to whom and to the company's resources we are today formally signing off on 14.9% of the shares. To facilitate this, interest free staff loans were arranged and, as I appreciate, pay was forgone for a period. The profit sharing scheme is approximately 10% of company profits for the staff. I do not know how good the Deputy is at arithmetic. The value of Aer Lingus is somewhere between &euro;400 million and &euro;1 billion. At a figure of &euro;500 million, which is not a valuation but a figure picked for ease of calculation, 15% is &euro;75 million. I have paid tribute to the workers in Aer Lingus and I continue to do so. They have done a fine job. However, it is not as if the other side of the equation has been found wanting. The company and the taxpayer have today provided &euro;75 million <Col N="537"/>worth of shares to Aer Lingus workers, for which they have not had to pay as we would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They paid in kind through the survival package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>They got interest free loans, 10% of the profits and shares which this House is awarding today, worth approximately &euro;75 million or perhaps more. The value could be twice or three times that or half of that. It is substantial and this House is agreeing to it. We must watch the two sides to this.</P>
      <P>Some 40 times perhaps, I have spoken on the matter of ideology and principle to Deputy Shortall but we will never agree on it. Any time a Government is accused of moving from the public sector to the private sector, it is called ideology. It is called principle when that is not the case. When one is standing up for the State company it is called a principle. Why is it not an ideology to be for State enterprise? This is an interesting <Col N="538"/>question because every time the Deputy gets on her feet she accuses me of being ideological.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has anticipated my reply. Deputy Naughten believed the wording of the section was duplication. To ensure there is no confusion or doubt about the ability of the company to issue new shares or divide them and to ensure the legislation serves the purpose intended, the advice of the parliamentary counsel is that the existing text should be retained.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, I have been in correspondence with you on your ruling in this regard and the ruling of the Bills Office. There is a long established precedent that amendments requesting a Minister to report to the House are accepted. The Chair knows perfectly well how restricted members of the Opposition are in terms of amendments and that we are not allowed to table amendments that result in a charge on the Exchequer. Our only other option to raise an issue is to ask the Minister to report on it, and such reporting to the House on the implications of the pensions scheme does not result in a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The precedent is long established in respect of Social Welfare Bills. Every year, several amendments requesting reports are deemed to be in order and are accepted. I can quote other precedents, such as the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, the Freedom of Information Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we come to deal with the proposal to recommit a section of the Bill, I wish to outline the position to the Deputy. I carefully studied the correspondence from your party's Whip. I have also studied the precedents in this House and have ruled in accordance with all my predecessors. The only instance in which such an amendment was allowed is in Social Welfare Bills. I understand this was agreed by a sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform. The view was that it would not be possible to have amendments to Social Welfare Bills unless special exemption was made for them. I have studied the rulings carefully and in all other instances, such amendments were not permitted. That is the ruling on this issue.</P>
      <P>We will not have a debate on this here. If the Deputy wants to come to the Office of the Ceann <Col N="542"/>Comhairle, we will be glad to discuss it in detail and show her the rulings.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 8 not moved.</P><Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 9 arises out of committee proceedings. Amendment No. 10 is related and the amendments may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, line 45, to delete &ldquo;or former employees&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendments concern the Aer Lingus pension fund, which the Minister described as adequate. While I am aware that the fund is linked to national wage agreements, it must be linked to the consumer price index. We are concerned at the failure to change the pension arrangements for employees of Aer Lingus, and possibly Aer Rianta, who have been employed with the company since 1970. In other words, under the Bill, the contributory old age pension will be deducted from any pension received by this group of employees. The amendments propose to change that position.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that the Retired Aviation Staff Association would meet the chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Willy Walsh. Did that meeting take place and, if so, what was its outcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. While I was not involved in the Committee Stage debate, I recall that I referred in my contribution <Col N="544"/>on Second Stage to the need to provide for an appropriate pension scheme. For years, the retired staff of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta have made the case that their pension schemes have fallen behind those of other public servants. The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the part privatisation of Aer Lingus in the future. In that context, it would be appropriate to take cognisance of the needs and plight of the people who worked to build up the company over the years and made sacrifices during difficult times to make it attractive.</P>
      <P>The Aer Lingus pension scheme is inadequate and is not linked to national wage agreements or index linked in any shape or form. The Bill must provide that any new pension scheme be at least as good as those enjoyed by comparable employees in the public and private sectors. On that basis, I hope the Minister looks favourably on the amendment and addresses the issue in the interests of those who have given time and effort to build up the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and the comments of the previous speakers. Members of the Retired Aviation Staff Association are concerned about their future position in the event that Aer Lingus is sold and transferred to private ownership. They are also concerned about the current arrangements for the company pension scheme and the adequacy of its funding. A dispute about whether the company's contribution to the scheme is inadequate has been ongoing for some time.</P><Col N="545"/>
      <P>The Minister and Opposition spokespersons have received many representations on this issue, but it was not until a song and dance was made and parliamentary questions were tabled that the RASA managed to secure a meeting with the chief executive of Aer Lingus, which is not an acceptable way for the chief executive of a major company to behave in respect of retired staff. When we discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage, the Minister stated that arrangements had already been made for such a meeting, which was to take place a couple of weeks later.</P>
      <P>Retired staff are looking to the Minister to provide some guarantee on the standing of the pension scheme in the future. They have many concerns, principally about the funding of the scheme and the issue of index linking their pensions. Notwithstanding how difficult it was to do business with the company and the Government under the current arrangements, staff are concerned that unless some guarantees as to the security of their pensions are written into the legislation, they will be left at the mercy of the future owners if Aer Lingus is sold. This is an unacceptable way to treat people who have given long service to an excellent semi-State company.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will be aware, many of the people concerned opted for early retirement as part of two survival packages for Aer Lingus, introduced in the past decade or thereabouts. These people are fearful for the future and the least the chief executive should have done was meet them on request. It is unfortunate that we have reached the stage that the Minister had to request the chief executive to talk to the RASA. I ask the Minister to report to the House on the outcome of the meeting and the guarantees or undertakings that can be given to retired Aer Lingus staff to allay their fears.</P>
      <P>In my earlier amendment, I endeavoured to receive a report from the Minister on what he would do to safeguard the security of the pension scheme in the future and I regret the Chair's ruling on the matter, which I will pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is necessary for me to reject these amendments. I can confirm that a meeting took place between Mr. Willie Walsh, chief executive of Aer Lingus, and representatives of RASA on 23 January 2004, at which the representatives of RASA outlined their position in full. In response, Mr. Walsh provided a statement which set out Aer Lingus's position regarding the pension scheme. The statement advised, <i>inter alia</i>, that Aer Lingus had not changed the rules of the scheme nor does it have any proposals to do so. In addition, the company has no proposals to establish a new scheme.</P>
      <P>As an employer, Aer Lingus has an obligation to make contributions at the rates set out in the rules of the scheme and has complied with this obligation in full in respect of all current and former employees. I understand it was agreed at <Col N="546"/>the meeting that both parties would reflect on the matters raised with a view to arranging a further meeting if either side felt that was necessary.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State companies, including Aer Lingus, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company or companies involved. The State has no direct involvement in the funding of these schemes.</P>
      <P>I wish to read the contents of a letter which I have received from the Department of Finance, dated 28 January 2004, which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">... it is a long standing policy and principle that pensions in the commercial semi-state sector are a matter for the trustees of the funds, the members of the schemes, and the companies themselves. It is inappropriate that ... the Department should become involved in this matter. Any issues raised on this front should be referred to the Company.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This has been a long-standing policy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Irish airlines' general employees' superannuation scheme which covers general employees in Aer Lingus, it is important to explain that this is a multi-employer scheme which includes two semi-State companies. A key issue of the scheme is that it cannot be amended without the consent of all participating employers and a majority of members so that no employer is in a position to negotiate exclusively with its employees as to their pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>Deputies Naughten and Shortall raised the issue of funding. Pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus, are a matter for the trustees. I understand that employers have met all their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It was said on Committee Stage that there may not be enough money in the existing pension funds to meet the rules of the scheme; that is not the case. I am advised that the last actuarial valuation was carried out on 31 March 2003 and the scheme satisfied the minimum funding standard included in the Pensions Act 1990.The rules do not provide for annual pension increases on the basis of the current valuation or for future pension increases. I understand that the scheme is more than adequately funded to meet current pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons it would not be an option for Aer Lingus to establish pension schemes specifically for former employees which would have benefits paid out in line with national wage agreements. Aer Lingus has advised that, in any new scheme, the lines proposed would be immediately in breach of the minimum funding standard under the Pensions Act as the assets which would be transferred from the existing scheme to the new scheme would be insufficient to provide for an increase in benefits in line with national wage agreements. The additional funding would have to be made available to the <Col N="547"/>fund and the question arises as to who should provide that funding. We have already ruled out State funding in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point made by the Minister, I note that he said he has already ruled out State funding. There is nothing preventing the company from providing additional funding to the scheme. I note the message from the Minister for Finance that this is a matter for the company and he refers the matter to Aer Lingus. That is a little rich. The Minister for Finance is the sole shareholder in Aer Lingus. If the company were to remain in public ownership, I would agree that it should be resolved between the company and the retired staff. The difficulty is that they have not managed to secure a meeting with the chief executive until recently on the intervention of the Minister, and therefore it is difficult enough for them to do business. In the event of the ownership of the company changing in the future, there is certainly a moral responsibility on the Minister for Transport to ensure that the concerns of the retired staff are addressed. I appreciate the Minister's action in ensuring that the meeting with Mr. Walsh took place in January but there are outstanding issues as the Minister has stated and the meeting did not result in any agreement being reached.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to resolve this issue prior to any change taking place in the future ownership of the company? In providing that commitment, will he report back to the House on the outcome of the next meeting with the chief executive and the action the Minister is prepared to take to resolve the matter prior to the Government divesting itself of any part of the company? Will he report to the House at the same time as he is reporting on the proposals for the future ownership of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted these amendments. I believe the Minister for Finance would be delighted if part of Aer Lingus was put up for sale in the morning because all the funds would go into the State coffers and provide him with significant funds for future budgets. The Minister is wrong when he says no funding is available. He would be quick to take the funding if there were a sale of Aer Lingus in the morning.</P>
      <P>Obviously little transpired at the meeting with the retired aviation staff association and the chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Walsh. It is disappointing because many of these people gave long service and a life commitment to the company and the company has grown substantially over the years. It had its bad times but has been successful in recent times with profits of up to &euro;70 million and &euro;80 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively.</P>
      <P>I will press this amendment. I am sorry the Minister has not accepted the amendments. As Deputy Shortall said, I hope that future meetings <Col N="548"/>will take place between RASA and the chief executive and that there will be a favourable outcome to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was interesting to hear the Minister speak about the Minister for Finance. Primary teachers would not be too pleased with the unilateral changes the Minister introduced to their pension scheme. Those hoping for some assurances from the Minister will note that he has not been able to give them. The concern of many former workers in Aer Lingus is that they regard this legislation as changing Aer Lingus. They are naturally concerned that their pensions will not meet the standard they hoped for when they retired. Nothing the Minister said will reassure these people, rather concerns will be heightened with the passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disappointing to listen to the Minister when he gives the impression neither he nor the Minister for Finance has a role in a decision to alter or change the structure of the existing pension scheme for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. Any proposal to change this scheme would require the approval of the Government. It is in that sense that the retired Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta staff are angry and appalled by the treatment they have received over the years. Having acknowledged the problem, the Minister was not prepared to deal with it in a substantial way.</P>
      <P>When one reads and examines the Bill and its objectives, one encounters a fact of life &mdash; the existing staff have a poor pension which does not keep pace with inflation. The longer they live, the worse it will get for those who have made great efforts. Certain people wish to move in for the kill and to acquire Aer Lingus by buying shares in it. The Government has shown in this Bill that it is prepared to facilitate such people. Deputy Shortall argued that the Government will facilitate a change of ownership in Aer Lingus if it has its way. There is not the slightest possibility that the existing inadequate status of the pension scheme will be improved for current and future pensioners. It is totally unacceptable that it cannot be rectified in the context of this Bill, which will change the status of Aer Lingus at some future stage if the present Government continues in power. If that is the case, nothing can be done about it. It is imperative that the objective of providing for a fair and agreed pension scheme should be incorporated in this Bill. I cannot see why the Minister cannot incorporate such a scheme in some way.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any precedent, in the public or private sectors, for establishing a new scheme for pensioners along the lines of that suggested by Deputy Ryan. The scheme he suggests would result in the payment of benefits which would exceed those which have been paid for by means of contributions. It is not possible to deal with the pensioners in isolation from the existing employees, as that is a separate issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue has implications beyond those which apply to Aer Lingus and the case under consideration. Apart from the funding and the legal reasons, I do not think it is feasible to devise a scheme for former employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I pointed out earlier, it has to be a matter for the trustees and the company. I do not think it is appropriate for a Minister to get involved in detailed negotiations about the level of pensions in commercial semi-State companies. The Deputy is correct when he says that the Department of Finance ultimately signs off on these agreements, but it does so on the basis of prudence and governance rather than on the basis of specific negotiation of the details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point made by Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan about existing employees. I have dealt with it from the point of view of the company's responsibility. There is no precedent in the public or private sectors for establishing schemes for former employees. The fact that such a precedent does not exist has enormous implications in the entire commercial semi-State sector area. I do not think that I can do it for that reason.</P>

    <Title>Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I had possession and I will make a short contribution now. I have learnt a great deal since then. I was amazed at the number of telephone calls from around the country in response to my comments here. When the Minister is responding he should check with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and tell us how, when the Local Government Bill was going through the <Col N="552"/>House, the county managers received a derogation from Government allowing them on one occasion to pick their own interview boards to select people for appointment under this Bill. Why was this allowed when every other job in the country had to go through the Civil Service Commission and Local Authority Commission? The county managers appointed the interview boards and only when someone appointed by those boards left a job did it go to the public service commissions.</P>
      <P>Are we living in a dictatorship? Is the Government now so arrogant that it thinks it can do what it wants and bring the public service with it? Why is that happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin introduced that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="553"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>What is Deputy Michael Ahern saying? He was in the Government that allowed this to happen. He should have defended democracy and not acted like a dictator. This Government is like a bunch of dictators. The people are waiting for them and when they get their chance they will deal with the little dictators. The Minister must explain how this could happen in a civilised society where we have rules and regulations. Why were they broken and a situation allowed to arise whereby county managers could select their own interview boards?</P>
      <P>I received telephone calls from around the country agreeing with comments I made here. These callers were prepared to go on the record because they felt let down. They had given good public service but because they were not yes men in their counties they were not selected or catered for in the interview process. A newspaper commentator recently said that I had not gone far enough, adding that we had reverted to the bad old days when to become the town foreman or the town ganger one had to be a card-carrying member of Fianna F&aacute;il. It seems that will happen again, instead of allowing the public service commissions deal with people and give everyone an equal opportunity. I did not think I had struck such a chord. Some politicians did not agree with my views but 20 and ten years ago people did not agree with politicians who said corruption was rife in Dublin Corporation. Members of the Green Party and the Labour Party were nearly beaten up for saying that. Today there are tribunals inquiring into corruption in planning matters.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be withdrawn immediately. I will vote against it whether or not my party does. It is a step in the wrong direction. The present programme managers, assistant programme managers, press officers and so on think, like the Government, that they will be there forever and be drafted into pensionable jobs in the public service. I hope the Bill will be defeated. It is bad legislation. We have a process which should be left in place. There should not be a situation whereby Ministers and county managers can take in whomever they wish from the streets without going through the proper channels, namely the Civil Service Commission. Nobody knew what happened on the introduction of the Local Government Bill. It was outrageous. It is as if Alex Ferguson, on being appointed manager of Manchester United said he wanted to determine who was on the team. That would not be right and it should not happen.</P>
      <P>Some excellent people work in local authorities who would do well in the private sector. There are also those in the public sector who would not get a job in the private sector. Some are not employable but they are there for good. I have never heard of anyone being removed from the public sector, whether they can do the job or not. There are others who give excellent service but <Col N="554"/>some of them who were independent minded, respected by councillors and the people, and treated everyone equally were not selected because some county managers did not like them.</P>
      <P>An amazing number of people contacted me, saying I could put their names on the record because some gave 20 or 25 years of their life to the public service which then let them down. This Bill is outrageous and should be opposed. I put down a challenge to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to telephone or write to every local council in the country and find out how many people are in the public service who have relatives already working in the service. I did not think I had opened such a can of worms. People are annoyed and aggravated. If the Bill is passed, the friends of the Progressive Democrats, Fianna F&aacute;il and the county managers will be lined up for jobs in the public service. The existing system may not be perfect but it is better than this proposal which gives the Ministers and country managers the right to bring in specialised people. We know what kind of specialised people they will be, and what will be their qualities and loyalties.</P>
      <P>There was a time when councils used to select the rate collectors. They would come to a council meeting and when the person's name was called out people voted on it. Whoever had the majority on that day in the council decided on the person to be appointed. Let us not return to the bad old days. People still talk about certain families which could never get a job with the public service or the county councils, whereas if one was in a certain organisation, two generations of a family could be appointed. It is amazing how many members of one family can get a job when members of another family cannot get any.</P>
      <P>This is bad legislation. It is a step in the wrong direction. We are going back to the bad old days and to the time when it mattered who a person was. At least the points system for university is fair. If a student does the leaving certificate and gets enough points, he or she can go to university. There was a time when a person had to be a member of a professional family to get into certain professions. I am glad that day is gone. We now have a fair system. The commission has a job to do, although I do not always agree with the way it does it. This legislation should be opposed.</P>
      <P>I will not comment on the dual mandate or the electronic voting. One would think we were living in Russia, which moved from a dictatorship to a democracy. We are moving from a democracy to a dictatorship. The Government has been in office so long it has gone stale. It thinks it cannot be removed and that it is above the people. The Taoiseach is the same in the way he treats this House in terms of D&aacute;il reform. He is gone again today and he will probably be in Lansdowne Road tonight. He will not be here in the House tomorrow morning, where he should be, to explain to the people what is happening. That is <Col N="555"/>called accountability. I hope the people will redress the imbalance they created at the last election. I believe they will because they have seen that they made a major mistake. I said last week that the Progressive Democrats were supposed to be the Government watchdogs. I called them the poodles. However, I apologise to the poodles because at least they would bite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>They would understand the Deputy's language of barking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not surprised the Progressive Democrats have allowed this to happen when one considers what happens on a weekly basis and the introduction of measures such as electronic voting.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill is defeated and that we do not go back to the bad old days. It is wrong that the existing system is not being kept. No one should be allowed to become part of the public service through the back door. The people in the public service give a lifetime of work. Some of them worked in the system from the bottom up. It is a good system. I am surprised the public servants are allowing this to happen because they will be left behind when people are chosen from outside the public service. That should not happen because there are good people in the Civil Service who are doing a good job. I am totally opposed to the Bill, which I hope is defeated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>My party also believes that the Bill is a recipe for the politicisation of the civil and public service. Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as re-politicisation. It is part of a package of change &mdash; another key element of which is the form of decentralisation settled on by the Government, to which I will return shortly &mdash; whose principal purpose is to copperfasten the hold on office of one political party. It is of a piece with other changes that the Government has introduced and would like to introduce, such as the emasculation of freedom of information, the threat to put a Government appointed press council in place to regulate such issues as journalistic standards, the desire to eliminate election spending limits and the need to publicly account for such spending and the unseemly and inappropriate grabbing of the dormant accounts fund to help swell the political war chest. The longer the controversy about electronic voting goes on, the more one has to wonder about who intends to exercise final control over how votes are counted in future elections.</P>
      <P>It is not long ago, as Deputy Ring said, that in our political culture the entire range of public service appointments were filled on the basis of a single criterion, namely, how one voted at election time. Rent collectors, rate collectors, post office officials and a number of different grades in the Civil Service throughout the country <Col N="556"/>had one thing in common, namely, they all belonged to one political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They represented a grace and favour network of patronage and they repaid the favour by representing a type of embedded front line of troops for the political party in question. We do not need to name the political party here, but we must point out that the system gradually came to be recognised as a corruption of the entire ethos of public service. Who one knew, not what one knew, became the basis of doing business with the public service. It affected every aspect of life, including the installation of a telephone, the procuring of a bed in a county home for an elderly relative, the landing of a public service job for the son or daughter and the ability to jump the queue in respect of local authority housing. All these and more were areas of life where merit or need were not important. It was all about how well connected one was with the local party representative. The public servants one dealt with acted in too many cases as nothing more than channels to the real decision-makers. We did not call it Tammany Hall in Ireland, but that was what it was.</P>
      <P>One of the key things that brought that system to an end over time was the development and gradual extension of the remit of the Civil Service Commissioners and the Local Appointments Commission. It might not have been perfect, as Deputy Ring said, but it was a step forward. It gave young people from Mizen Head to Cahirciveen an equal opportunity to be considered for recruitment to the civil and public service. Now we see the beginning of the dismantling of that system and its replacement with a system which will, once again, facilitate the development of an underhand and wrongly motivated approach to recruitment in the public service. It is a dangerous and sinister development on a par with many of the other innovations introduced by this arrogant Government.</P>
      <P>No other explanation is possible. Let me illustrate what I mean by applying the Government's own professed standards, or its ostensible standards as opposed to its real ones. A few weeks ago the Government published with the fanfare which is now customary outside the House, not in the House, a glossy White Paper called Regulating Better. Its purpose was stated to be to contribute to improving national competitiveness &mdash; everything announced by this Government is to improve competitiveness &mdash; and better Government by ensuring that new regulations are more rigorously assessed in terms of their impacts, are more accessible to all and are better understood. The White Paper identifies what the Government regards as the six principles of good regulation. The first is headed &ldquo;Necessity&rdquo; &mdash; in other words, is the regulation necessary? Can we reduce red tape in this area? <Col N="557"/>Are the rules and structures that govern this area still valid? The remaining principles include effectiveness, proportionality, transparency, accountability and consistency.</P>
      <P>Let us apply these principles to the Bill. Is the Bill necessary, which is the Government's first criterion? Its purpose is described as being &ldquo;to provide a modern and efficient framework for public service recruitment which allows for increased flexibility while maintaining the current high standards of probity&rdquo;. Cutting through the jargon, there is no doubt that the Bill allows for flexibility, but who was complaining about the rigidity of the present system? The integrity of a system and its flexibility in response to the demands of those in power are competing values; integrity is the more important. Can we reduce red tape in this area, which was the Government's next criterion? The Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 has 32 sections and two schedules. It is proposed to replace it with a Bill more than twice its size and at least five times as complicated. Are the rules and structures that govern this area still valid, another one of the Government's criteria? No one has yet come forward to explain to this House what precisely they think is wrong with the present structure.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on regulation lists better than we could other questions that arise when presented with this Bill. Is it properly targeted? Will it be properly complied with and enforced? Are we satisfied that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? Is there a smarter way of achieving the same goal? Have we consulted with stakeholders prior to regulating? Is there an effective appeals process? Will it give rise to anomalies and inconsistencies? Are we applying best practice?</P>
      <P>The White Paper states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Government will make better use of evidence-based policy-making. This means making better use of research and analysis in both policy-making and policy implementation. Regulation is an expression of policy and Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is an evidence-based approach that allows for the systematic consideration of the benefits and costs of a regulatory proposal to the economy and society.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Where is the regulatory impact analysis here, or any evidence upon which to ground an evidence-based policy approach that leads to the conclusion that the Civil Service Commissioners should be broken up?</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will tell us that as this was negotiated with the unions in Sustaining Progress, all of us on this side of the House are supposed to believe it makes it correct and that we should not have an opinion as the elected Opposition. This was before decentralisation. The Minister should talk to the unions now. I read in the newspapers of the surveys carried out on behalf of certain prominent trade union officials showing the resistance to decentralisation. They <Col N="558"/>now suddenly have a different view about public service recruitment. I say this notwithstanding my party's close relationship with the trade union movement. The unions were wrong to enter into this in Sustaining Progress and they now know it.</P>
      <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, told us that decentralisation was not going too well at the moment and he asked who would want to be decentralised on these dark mornings. He said that as soon as there was a stretch in the evenings everybody would move out automatically. We know this is not true.</P>

	<P>Perhaps I should come to the point. I have reviewed the Civil Service's surveys.

	<P>The Minister of State may be correct. As he says civil servants may move like flies. However I have carried out a tally. F&Aacute;S staff carried out a survey, which was published last Sunday. Of the entire staff, 30 have proffered, which represents 7% of the head office. The staff of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism are determined to resist being forced out of their homes. Huge majorities in the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources have declared they are not interested. Almost 90% of the staff of the T&aacute;naiste's Department have objected to moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>They objected to a particular place. I read today that 48% of the staff of that Department said they were prepared to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will concede to the Minister of State if that is right. I did not read that today.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="560"/>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is putting a spin on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well used to reading spin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can also spin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>God knows, I read nothing but Government spin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We are paying for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how the Minister's head is not in a spin, with all the spinning the Government is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to be spun around by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The unfortunate people of Laois must have their heads in a spin with all the leaflets. I was only aware of the statistic from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which I just read. If the staff there have changed position, I will be the first to cede that to the Minister of State. The published figures for that Department showed that 90% of staff were opposed.</P>
      <P>Seven out of every eight senior civil servants in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have no intention of going anywhere. Higher civil servants in general have reacted with dismay and anxiety at the plan to break up the coherence of the Civil Service. The public service unions, especially those representing specialist grades, have unanimously predicted that <i>ad hoc</i> and unplanned decentralisation will have a disastrous effect on every specialised agency for years to come.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation was feasible in a planned and co-ordinated fashion that would represent some affinity with the published spatial plan to negotiate the transfer within the Civil Service and public service of self-contained units of people who wanted to move. However the Government chose not to do it that way. The Minister for Finance chose to divert attention from a nondescript budget and in the knowledge that local and European elections were imminent to announce the transfer of 44 Departments and agencies of State without any consultation with the public service or even its senior management.</P>
      <P>After a number of days, we established that even the Minister of State did not know about it. The Minister for Finance told the House he felt the Minister of State picked up a whisper of it in a local pub. The announcement was made without anybody knowing about it. The Minister of State said it is not mandatory but voluntary. As one who supports balanced regional development, the only conclusion I can draw is that if it is not mandatory, we will have to recruit more civil servants locally to do the job in the various locations to which they are being sent. Has anybody calculated how much this will cost?</P><Col N="561"/>
      <P>We have the experiences of those sections and offices that have moved. In a gradual phased partial transfer of Departments it would be possible to enjoy the luxury of people transferring between Departments and those people whom it suited to go back to a particular location to do that. In circumstances where Departments are being transferred lock, stock and barrel the prospect now is of us double recruiting with the Secretary General using the local employment agency. It is already happening in the local land and office provision. I am sure we know what it means when it goes out to the local Fianna F&aacute;il recruitment agency. In case we do not know what it means, the Minister is bringing in a Bill to give a statutory underpinning to the Fianna F&aacute;il recruitment agency, to make sure it recruits only on a wink and a nod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows full well that is not what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is. Has the Minister of State read the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is precisely what it contains. The Minister of State should know that.</P>
      <P>The cases to which I have referred are the ones that have attracted publicity recently, but I understand that throughout the Civil Service there is growing opposition to the upheaval that will be involved on a personal basis and a growing recognition that the immediate consequences of this mass unplanned exodus will be administrative chaos. So far the Government's response has been a mixture of threats and wheedling. The T&aacute;naiste is quoted as saying that civil servants are obliged to implement Government policy, while her junior Minister, the man who delivers, says that he believes that far more public servants will want to move once the daffodils are in bloom and the sound of the first cuckoo is not too distant.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he has invited every property owner and developer in the country with an office block or a plot of land to sell to apply to him so the Office of Public Works can spent hours of useless time and hundreds of thousands of euro deciding whether it will buy properties in every marginal constituency in Ireland. He also announces that he has 700 potential customers who are willing to make a buck at the State's expense. I would be ready to make a small wager that not one of those customers will be told their properties are unsuitable or too expensive until after the local and European elections.</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy that will not be the case. The evaluation has already been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I made, which the Minister of State wants me to withdraw, is that none of the potential applicants will be deemed unsuitable between now and the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to finding out. Nothing is sacred to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I note he considers Ronald McDonald a <Col N="563"/>suitable anchor tenant for the Custom House, provided the branding is subtle and not too overstated. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, once vacated, will be sold to Dunnes Stores, the better to provide bargains in lingerie and underwear for those Members of the House who feel an urgent need. Whatever needs to be sold to finance this grandiose scheme will be sold. The overall consequences of this ill thought out, unplanned break-up of the Civil Service will be a great increase in the cost of running the service and damage to the coherence of a source of independent advice and careful management that has been built up and nurtured since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that a rational and well planned approach to decentralisation could have hugely beneficial effects in terms of a wide range of social and economic issues. The better distribution of public services throughout the country, especially by careful location of discrete agencies and sections of Departments, would have positive effects not only on the delivery of services but also on such things as traffic, house prices, development of education infrastructure and so on. This crazy scheme, however, will only result in chaos, the wholesale disruption of people and services and disgruntled local communities. The lack of planning and consultation in the matter of decentralisation has almost certainly doomed it to failure.</P>
      <P>In the context of what we are discussing, however, the rationale behind decentralisation is worth remembering. Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind: this is much more than a political gimmick. The Government has become so arrogant and power-driven that it is prepared to do whatever it can get away with. The combination of decentralisation and locally controlled recruitment to the public service is a recipe for politicisation of the service. As such, it is a recipe for disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Healy and Cowley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to Deputy Rabbitte's point, there is genuine concern that the Government has been in power for so long that it has lost any humility or sense of caution it may have had in tinkering with the institutions and structures of State to fit them to its designs. Certain aspects of the Bill bear this out. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's comments about the difficulties the Government will have in trying to achieve the decentralisation plans it has come up with. It consulted with nobody, apparently, on these plans but launched them as a stunt to disguise an incredibly bland and visionless budget. It inserted the decentralisation process into the budget as the main story of the day. This <Col N="564"/>is not the best way of directing the future structures and institutions of the State. I will not repeat the concerns raised by Deputy Rabbitte about the reaction of the Civil Service to this forced decentralisation. It will be forced if civil servants find they have no career options unless they move down to Portarlington or Carlow.</P>
      <P>For all the blather and bluster of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about gateways and hubs in the national spatial strategy, it is clear that in the decentralisation process the Government's intent is to create further development in the greater Dublin-Leinster conurbation. In this area people commute incredibly long distances to Dublin and back. Many other strange travel patterns are now developing. The decentralisation process has not taken account of the furthest reaches of the country. It has been concentrated in the greater Dublin and Leinster areas &mdash; areas within driving distance of Dublin for a day's work, particularly in light of all the motorways the Government has built. We are creating a conurbation similar to Los Angeles and other areas of large economic power around the world &mdash; areas in which people drive 100 miles from one office to another. The Government's decentralisation plans accentuate that development in our country. I do not see this as a proper decentralisation process. Rather, it maintains the development that has resulted from the building of motorways. Areas within 50 to 100 miles of Dublin are developing into satellite towns and because of decentralisation, that process will continue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o'clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is hard to make sense of the locations planned for decentralisation. I will refer to the decision that has been commented on more than any other, namely, to move the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Cavan. As the Green Party spokesperson in this area, I find it hard to make sense of such a move. If a more enlightened position were taken, we would consider somewhere in Cork or Galway for such a centre. There would be a connection with the Naval Service and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is destined to go to Clonakilty, and in Galway there would possibly be connections with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. There are also connections with the sea. This is a classic example. Why is this Department being relocated to Cavan? It shows an incredible lack of vision on the part of a Government which is incredibly poor at joined-up thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Deputy also say that the Department of Agriculture and Food should be in Dublin where it has been since the foundation of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with decentralisation <i>per se</i> but with the way the Government is managing it. I have a different vision of decentralisation. There should be a <Col N="565"/>series of Departments in different parts of the country where a range of different services would be provided within a single office. There would, for example, be a strong local tax office close to a strong social welfare office and education department so the real decision making would occur on an integrated basis between different Departments at local level. That is the form of decentralisation I would pursue. I certainly would not adopt the confetti approach of the Government which was based on the motorways more than any other factor, regardless of what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government might say.</P>
      <P>The second concern about the Bill was put forward by a number of senior civil servants who are deeply concerned about the Government's intention to introduce a provision whereby its special advisers can be inserted into the Civil Service on a permanent basis. The civil servants are deeply fearful for the future independence of the Civil Service should such a provision be included. A civil servant, who is experienced at dealing with various handlers, ministerial appointees and advisers over the years, told me: &ldquo;One could at least maintain a certain independence, knowing that the creature would be heading off again in four or five years.&rdquo; I should not use the word &ldquo;creature&rdquo; but I am attempting roughly to characterise what he said.</P>
      <P>His point was that there was a certain relationship or distance between them and one still had an ability to provide an independent opinion if one knew that the adviser would be replaced after a number of years. If there is a new cadre of politically appointed officers in the Civil Service who are there for a Government which has been in power for a long time and might continue in power for longer unless an election intervenes, one would begin to change the advice one gives to suit what one thinks that person wants. One would start to lose one's independence. That would be a hugely damaging change to the quality of decision making in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>It is an incredibly dangerous proposal from a Government which is so long in power, it does not have the humility to realise that it can be wrong. It does not own the power positions in the State and should not appoint people to those positions. It needs an independent Civil Service to be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it occasionally and to call a spade, a spade. That is what might change if the Government changes the Civil Service structure to introduce outside individuals whom it appoints to senior positions. That is my fear about the provisions of this Bill. We will challenge them on later Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Office of Public Works is known for the quality but not the speed of its work. I particularly refer the Minister of State to the Clonmel flood alleviation scheme which has been with the Office of Public Works for the past two <Col N="566"/>years. We still await a response. Perhaps some time might be devoted by the Office of Public Works to approving that scheme to let us proceed with dealing with the serious problem of flooding in Clonmel and south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to politicise and privatise the public service. Previous speakers have referred to decentralisation. I unreservedly support the decentralisation programme. However, I am concerned that the manner in which the Government has dealt with it will mean that it will take years for the programme to be put in place. I hope I am wrong about that. Since I became a Member of the House in 2001, I have regularly pursued the question of decentralisation. Each time the Minister replied that it was a difficult matter which required consultation with various stakeholders, it would take some time, the consultations were ongoing and a decision would be made when they were completed. I received a reply to that effect on the same week the decentralisation programme was announced in the 2004 budget.</P>
      <P>Four years were required to take this decision and Members were told it was being delayed by various consultations and negotiations. However, as we have discovered since then, there were no negotiations and consultations with the Civil Service about decentralisation. That is the difficulty I have with the ideology behind this Bill. It is an ideology we cannot trust. It is the ideology of privatisation and the arrogance this Government shows towards everything. It is an ideology that says to civil servants: &ldquo;We have made the decision and now it is to be implemented.&rdquo; There is no consultation or negotiation with the Civil Service. I hope that what happened in the past will not delay the decentralisation of Departments, especially to Tipperary town which badly needs it.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to the case of Carrick-on-Suir which was overlooked in the decentralisation programme. This town desperately needs decentralisation. It fulfils all the criteria for the programme but was overlooked. It has a 20% unemployment rate; in a town of 5,000 people, 1,000 are on the live register. A total of 1,300 jobs are still unallocated in the decentralisation programme &mdash; 500 in the Department of Health and Children and 835 in information technology. The Minister should allocate some of those jobs to Carrick-on-Suir. There have been serious job losses in the town recently, in Bomont Plastics and in Sram. Will the Minister of State give this matter urgent consideration? I hope the manner in which decentralisation has been dealt with by the Government does not delay its implementation. I agree with Deputy Ryan that many of the decentralisation locations are in the greater Dublin area, which does not require decentralisation, and in ministerial constituencies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, I am concerned that the concept of privatisation, which is what the <Col N="567"/>Government is about, is to be implemented through the effective privatisation of the recruitment process. That is a serious matter. It is astounding. However, we should not be surprised because it is something the Government, especially the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, favours. The proposal will not be good for the public service. Private recruitment agencies will be infused with the values of industrial privatisation and multinational type ideas. This will not be good for the civil and public service. It is a dangerous proposal which will lead to the politicisation of the recruitment process at local level.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to retain the right to appoint commissioners to the Commission for Public Service Appointments. This is in line with policy pursued when many supposedly independent boards were being established in various areas of public activity. Will the nominees on this board effectively be supporters of the Government, currently composed of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, as has been the case in the past on similar boards? This provision leaves it open for the Minister to appoint political cronies to the commission. The Bill is not in the best interests of the public service and I hope to see it defeated in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I too have major suspicions about the Bill. The idea of decentralisation is good. As someone from the west, an area sorely in need of development, I welcome decentralisation. There is great suspicion in the public mind at present as to what is happening. Everybody agrees decentralisation is good. However many people feel there will only be token decentralisation. We welcome decentralisation to Knock Airport. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has been straightforward about locating his Department there. We also welcome decentralisation to Claremorris.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would have been an idea to decentralise the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to a place by the sea. Westport would have been lovely. We could have given civil servants everything they wanted there or even in Mulranny or Belmullet. For Belmullet, which needs something badly, this would have been wonderful. People feel that the proposed decentralisation is much more of the same unbalanced regional development. It should have been a great opportunity to have balanced regional development which would give hope to people.</P>
      <P>The basis of the Bill is that there are problems with the present system. It is obvious from talking to people and from what has been said in the House that people see the system as producing jobs for the boys. Many of us have heard and know of cases where it is clear there was favouritism or nepotism in bodies. I have no doubt about that. People hoped that this new <Col N="568"/>system would do what the old system was supposed to do, namely, keep out the politics. Now we wonder how successful it will be and are cynical about it.</P>
      <P>Society has changed and we need quick recruitment. The present system has been called cumbersome and slow and the new system promises more. However, people are not blind to what is happening currently. They need to know that the Bill means something for them, especially people in the west who are suspicious as a result of the past performance of Government, political parties, etc.</P>
      <P>My area in Mayo, which is in the Western Health Board region, has the unique distinction of having ambulance bases which, at more than 20 miles, are further from people than ambulance bases in other health board areas. An ambulance broke down below my house the other day because, like half the ambulances in the huge Castlebar area, it has more than 200,000 miles on the clock. People see this and look at this new system with suspicion. It is said we should not look a gift horse in the mouth but, when the gift is from a Government which has treated us badly over the years, we certainly question it. We have excellent ambulance staff but what good is that if they do not have the proper equipment to ensure they can use their hard-won skills to save lives?</P>
      <P>In the local hospital in Mayo we have a shortage of beds which results in people being left on trolleys. That is the situation throughout the county and we are not unique in that regard. However, people believe that the Government should ensure there are proper health services wherever it intends to bring civil servants. This might be a good opportunity for it to try to re-balance the unbalanced regional development of the past and provide proper health services in local areas. However, people are suspicious because, on one hand, the Government talks about sending people to the west but, on the other, is cutting back on services in local hospitals. People are also suspicious because they have seen years of neglect.</P>
      <P>There has also been an unequal spend in the west, especially on public transport. We still await the go-ahead for the western rail corridor. The projected spend in the Border, midland and western region is &euro;322 million, a 21% spend of the estimated cost of public transport, compared with an overspend of 174% in the south and east. We would love to see the situation improve across the board. We hope the Bill gives Government the opportunity to redress the imbalance, gives us balanced regional development and stops the vicious circle of people having to leave their area.</P>
      <P>Many older civil servants who would have loved to come to Mayo in the past were never given the opportunity. Now they may not be able to afford to move. The Government was remiss in not allowing decentralisation to occur years ago <Col N="569"/>instead of having half our graduates forced to go to Dublin for their first job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak on the Bill which is of concern to everybody. The legislation empowers Departments and other public service bodies to recruit staff directly as well as through a centralised system. In particular, the flexibilities being introduced in the Bill will support the Government in its decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>There are major reservations about the changes proposed to the traditional system of recruiting civil and public servants. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has been effective. I regret that the Bill, if enacted, will dissolve the commission which has served the country well since the foundation of the State. It has been effective, open and competitive. It provided examinations and reasonably fair access to Civil Service jobs for people from throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The system provided career opportunities independent of cliques and cronies. The devolution of recruitment functions to local and departmental levels and to private agencies may encourage a certain amount of favouritism. The record of jobs for the boys in the patronage tradition of Irish party politics does not inspire confidence.</P>
      <P>Looking at the management systems in the public service to date, we can see a lack of knowledge of the level of staff working in it. Let us take the health boards as an example. If one asked for an exact staffing figure from the chief executive officer of each health board, he or she could not provide accurate data. We must question the methodology used for recording staff numbers and the mechanism of inflow and outflow of staff in health boards and the health sector.</P>
      <P>We read in the newspapers this week a report of an extra 20,000 people recruited to the public service. That will mean a huge cost on the economy in future. The Minister went on the record and indicated that the policy was to reduce figures. I am not saying numbers should be reduced dramatically but something should be done about the management of the system. That the Minister was unaware of that increase in public service numbers clearly indicates what happens with the devolution of power within a tight system. What will happen when he devolves this role and gives other groups autonomy and power to employ people?</P>
      <P>It is difficult to interpret the figures in the payroll system of the health board sector, one of the largest employers in the State. Clearly, that is a function of the Department of Health and Children. However, ultimately it is a function of the Minister for Finance. The situation is akin to that of the number of beds available. The Department cannot even tell us the number of staff operating within the system.</P>
      <P>The Bill repeals the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 and introduces a new <Col N="570"/>framework for recruitment to the Civil Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other public service organisations which heretofore used the services of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. That commission was effective in the recruitment of staff. The new framework will consist of an oversight body to be known as the commission for public service appointments, CPSA; a centralised recruitment body to be known as the public appointments service, PAS, and a system of voluntary recruitment licensing. Will the Minister explain how this will be managed?</P>
      <P>We all know what happened before the last general election; a great deal of employment was given in every county council and health board. There was no sense of management. The largest investment any company will make is in staff, which is the greatest expense. The creation of short-term contracts can be unfair to staff if there is not a fair term of contract. Although people are taken in to a system, the job can be gone in six months.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has a number of grave reservations about the Bill. Our spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated that the Government had developed a cocksure confidence in its own invincibility. Before the last election the Taoiseach said he would end hospital waiting lists within two years; this will never happen. I do not know if it was an untruth, but whatever it was, it was based on false figures. However, I will not debate health issues.</P>
      <P>We are now told the Government will transfer 10,000 public servants, some one-third of the Civil Service and Government agencies, to 53 locations across the country within three years. While I welcome this, one has to be careful in regard to it. This should have been done many years ago. People might believe it if they were told it would happen on a staged basis. The Government only allocated &euro;20 million for decentralisation in the budget. That is a small amount of money with which to acquire properties.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is aware that the State has long-term property leases in Dublin city. He may be familiar with one instance where a property was leased for 25 years for the input of CSO statistics. The computers which were stored there cost &euro;9 million. Although they are now obsolete and the building is vacant, I believe the building continues to be leased. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the potential cost to the State of breaking the long-term leases on properties leased to the State. The Dublin market is flooded with office accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a strong market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I know a client in Dublin who has had 10,000 square feet ready to rent for two years. He has difficulty getting tenants and it is <Col N="571"/>not a case of him looking for a high rent. He is in a tax-designated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Rents are one-third the cost in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What properties has the Minister of State acquired in the country? The State invested &euro;1.5 million in a National Parks and Wildlife Service centre in Ballinafad. This was opened by the Taoiseach before the last election and it was closed when he left. The intention was to set up a regional office of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It has proved impossible to get five civil servants to come down to this regional office in Sligo. This saga has gone on for months although a building is available.</P>
      <P>I come from a business background and I am aware of the difficulty involved in acquiring sites, getting planning permission and getting agreement with civil servants. I sincerely hope it will happen. The Minister of State has welcomed people to his constituency, but we will have to wait and see the colour of the Minister for Finance's money. If he allocates &euro;100 million in the Estimate next year for the decentralisation programme then we will know he is telling the truth.</P>
      <P>A total of &euro;20 million in the commercial world does not amount to much. The Minister of State is aware of the situation in Offaly. Property is valuable everywhere now, be it in Offaly, Sligo or Dublin. Building costs are &euro;110 per square foot and it may be higher for commercial property. These are the kind of costs one will face when building office accommodation in Offaly, Sligo or Dublin. The sum of &euro;20 million would not move the smallest wing of the smallest Department.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the level of decentralisation to Sligo. I am aware of ten civil servants who are waiting to go there for the past two years. Vacancies exist for them but they are not being transferred. How can this be the case? These people have made enquiries of the Civil Service Commission and officials in their Departments. They are married and rearing families. At present they commute to work in Dublin and want to get back to Sligo, but they have been told it cannot be done. This was the response of the same Government that says it will now move 10,000 people in three years. This is a total contradiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of ten civil servants who want to be transferred to Sligo. Although the vacancies are there, they have been refused. At the same time the Government informs us that it intends shifting 10,000 civil servants from Dublin. <Col N="572"/>From small acorns large oaks grow. The ten civil servants who want to transfer to Sligo represent the small acorn in this case, but the Government says it is not possible for them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should address his remarks through the Chair. He should not provoke the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being honest. A total of 53 locations for decentralisation have been announced without any strategic evaluation. We are all aware of strategic management evaluation within Departments. These are the key documents of integration. Some Secretaries General were not told about the financial implications of the strategy. Deputy Gilmore and I are talking about being honest with the electorate and telling it exactly as it is.</P>
      <P>The legislation proposes to change something that has worked well. It has not been given any degree of evaluation. We are asked to make a simple act of faith in the wisdom of our present political masters. The House cannot afford to do this without serious scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The slogan &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo; worked in the last general election, but I hope that we are dealing with an intelligent electorate this time. A Minister and two Ministers of State visited Sligo last week in advance of the local elections. They were speaking about &ldquo;the west on track&rdquo;. This is the same Minister whose Department was before the Committee of Public Accounts on the previous day where it was revealed that &euro;5 million less was spent on rural transport initiatives and &euro;9 million less on the rail infrastructure programme. Yet, while the Minister could not announce a feasibility study funded by the Department, the promoters of the rail infrastructure programme announced it was on track. Such was the euphoria that I got the distinct impression the railway would arrive two hours after the Minister had left.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has serious questions to raise on the provisions of the Bill. I hope the Minister of State does not live to regret his big signs in Offaly. It is an example of &ldquo;live horse, get grass&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I had only one sign and it was in Laois.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="573"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>While it may have been one sign, it was in 100,000 newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It was but it could yet be poor value. Fine Gael fully supports the principle of decentralisation. It is good for the country, Dublin and the public service. However, the Bill needs to be properly scrutinised. If the Government keeps employing public servants, as would appear to be the case according to the report in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>, the decentralisation of 10,000 people would be a small figure. There will probably be a massive recruitment drive before the next general election.</P>
      <P>While people have a perception that the Government is giving a great service, it is spending taxpayers' money. I am disappointed that five jobs could not be filled in Ballinafad, where the State invested more than &euro;1.25 million, because the Department was unable to come to a deal. While there have been promises from the Western Commission and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Government is failing to manage the public service debacle. What are the risks of the decision on decentralisation? Our past experience is that there will be 30,000 positional changes if the Government is to succeed in moving 10,000 public servants within three years. We have seen what happened in Johnstown Castle with the decentralisation of the forestry service. The PAC has found that incompatible IT systems existed all over the place and the mapping system was particularly bad because staff were moved at the whim of the Minister. It meant those involved in the forestry sector were not getting the required service. It is another example of bad management.</P>
      <P>People want the Government to lead by example. This public service recruitment drive and the changes proposed are massive shifts. The number of staff working in the 11 health boards does not augur well for the introduction of a new system. I am concerned it will lead to inexperienced staff replacing experienced staff. It will lead to the loss of vital skills and institutional memory. We found an example of this at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Inexperienced staff in the Department of Transport signed off on audited accounts and no bank reconciliation was carried out. A large amount of cash was not accounted for in the appropriation account. It emerged that four key staff had left the accounts section and responsibility was delegated to inexperienced staff.</P>
      <P>Is the Government telling us that staff will volunteer to move to Knock, Birr or elsewhere at the whim of the public service? There will have to be big incentives, which is understandable. What will happen to the workload? There will be <Col N="574"/>costly failures. Some years ago the resignation of a judge was mishandled when a handful of staff were on temporary EU duties and those that remained did not know what to do.</P>
      <P>Under the strategic management process vital areas of public service modernisation have proceeded slowly. There is also defective IT compatibility between areas of the public service. The delegation of responsibility and performance appraisal has fallen short of what is needed. It is clear that e-government is failing to seize the enormous opportunities that exist. These are difficult tasks that require much effort but they will be slowed down, if not shelved, if the public service becomes overwhelmed by the task of shifting people to plug the leaks that will arise from such ill thought out changes.</P>
      <P>The public service has served us well. If staff are to be decentralised and Departments are to be given the responsibility to employ people, then it must be controlled. The Minister for Finance pays the bill. We do not want services being lost owing to the cost of having too many handlers. In business, staff costs are related to turnover. No effective benchmarking has been carried out between staff costs and the level of service the end user receives.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tread carefully on this issue. With this Bill, he is starting the next election campaign. Regrettably, people who genuinely deserve a service, such as those on hospital waiting lists, will be the losers as there will be too many chiefs and too few Indians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Bill. Having listened to this debate and on e-voting I have never heard so much nonsense from the Opposition in my time in the House. It is as if the Opposition wants us to remain in the past and do things as they have always been done since the foundation of the State. Speaker after speaker has condemned the Bill and e-voting at a time when the country is moving ahead in leaps and bounds with investment from both the Government and the private sector. The private sector and governments around the world are making a promotional effort on ICT. However, Members condemn e-voting and the modernising of an Act that, while it has served us well since 1956, needs to be updated. This is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything wrong with the Bill. Neither do I see anything wrong with introducing e-voting. It is an indication that our democracy is recognising the steps it needs to take in a modern economy. Listening to the Opposition, one would think the world was going to cave in if we take this step long after the private sector took similar steps. This is how the job is done in the real world; technology is how the world moves on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What part of the private sector uses technology without paper-based back up?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="575"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will get his chance to contribute. We use new technology every day of the week. While we do not complain about receiving PCs or laptop computers, using mobile phones or the use of credit cards, Members are willing to spend hours on end discussing e-voting when we all know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of e-voting is not relevant to this debate. Perhaps the Deputy could confine himself to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant to the attitude of the Opposition and what it has said on the Bill. I will address it in terms of technology and the Bill.</P>
   
   
	<P>The attitude of the Opposition to the Bill is similar to its attitude to e-voting; it belongs to the Dark Ages and not a modern Parliament. If members of the Opposition do not want decentralisation they should put up their hands and say so. They should send the numbers back to the Minister. In Carlow-Kilkenny, we will certainly take them. I have no problem in dealing with those numbers or the decentralisation policy. If that is the Opposition Members' attitude or their concern about their constituency in the context of people being sent throughout the country, they should tell us that they do not want the jobs. I am damned sure that many people around this House would accept the numbers the Opposition does not want. I am sure there are many people in the Civil Service looking forward to decentralisation who would gladly take up the offer to move on and get the job done elsewhere. Nothing remains static; everything changes and moves on. The Bill concerns change. In recent years, in the real commercial world outside rather than the public sector, everything has moved on and changed. If one remains static, one loses out. That is what happens when one is in business. One must look beyond where one is and make the necessary decisions.</P>
      <P>The Government has been in power since 1997, and my experience in this House has been that, regardless of what the Opposition says, significant amounts have been made available to local government and health boards, some of the latter even returning money because they could not spend it. There has been a great increase in the amounts given to various Departments and an enormous increase in activity within them. Does the Deputy mean to tell me that the infrastructure connected with taking those decisions and implementing different large-scale policies should remain the same and that we should ignore the fact that there is a problem with it?</P>
      <P>We acknowledged that problem in the context of the debate on ending the dual mandate. Speaker after speaker referred to the fact that, when they sought various officials, they were throughout the country on interview boards filling one vacancy or another. That is what was <Col N="576"/>being said about the manner in which it operated and continues to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be on the road a good deal more from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>While that system was good, the time has now come for people who are well paid, qualified and doing jobs in the various Departments to be at their desks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be stuck in traffic in Kinnegad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>They must be on top of their game and making decisions. Any other distraction should be taken out of the system and dealt with in a more efficient way. I have said that for the past ten years, and I have said the same thing in local government for 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy wanted to stay there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He wanted the dual mandate to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>We took a decision in this House, and that was the end of it. I accept the democratic decision that we reached. This decision is another right one, since it creates greater efficiency in the recruitment system of the civil and public service, and that is a good thing. The sooner we open up the process to allow people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good for Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy's problem, since he opposes the Bill on a false suspicion. He knows that, if he read the Bill properly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They are politicising the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Deputy speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he would see that there is no need either for that comment or that suspicion because the Bill provides for an adequate system to arrange for the recruitment of people into the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They want to become the permanent Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy with that, but the Deputy does not want to read the Bill. He wants to remain in the past. So be it; that is fine.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on doing the job properly. I believe that, in doing so, we should continue to focus on opening up those jobs as <Col N="577"/>much as possible and ensuring that every Department becomes responsible for its own actions. In that respect, they should become responsible for recruiting their own staff and go beyond the current system which is simply an improvement in grade as one goes along. They must look to the qualifications now needed in the service to deal with new problems and challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Such as?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only by open recruitment and changing the system that we can deal with this issue, and I believe that we are going in the right direction. On decentralisation, I will refer to other speakers' comments.</P>
      <P>Week on week, before the Committee of Public Accounts, as the Chairman of that committee knows, we deal with many issues, mainly regarding overspend, although sometimes the issue is underspend or the fact that an amount was not spent within a set period. Generally speaking, the excuses one hears concern the system's failure to be brought up to speed with what is required of it in today's world. We must therefore continually review our information technology and recruitment systems as happens in the private sector. If we embrace this Bill and the changes necessary in IT, we will have a far more efficient system with far more qualified people at the various levels in it to ensure that the job is done.</P>
      <P>There is an issue regarding recruitment which we should examine and which I referred to in the context of the Finance Bill. It is where public bodies such as health boards or local authorities continually seek consultants. It should be within the grasp of any Department to ensure that there are in-house consultants and skills to deliver advice to health boards and local authorities which would bring to an end high daily spending on employing consultants for the most minor tasks that they could do themselves if properly qualified people were available. So many jobs are now undertaken in counties throughout the country that we need not continue to reinvent the wheel every time we need a report on something. Surely it has already been made available by another local authority. Circumstances may be slightly different, but I am damned sure that we could obtain much better spending and value for money if we were to examine that system and how it operates. It is within the Minister's remit to do so and propose a plan to deal with it once and for all, thus saving the State a considerable amount of money.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation has been referred to repeatedly. I have said that I welcome it, and I believe it will work. I have seen it work in Kilkenny city where an office has already been established. At one time the local authority made a site available to the Office of Public Works which dealt with the building work, after which the staff moved in. That is how it was done at that time. The staff employed there are more <Col N="578"/>than happy with what has happened and are anxious to see more of it. They have a better quality of life and better working practices with that arrangement. For that reason, the decentralisation package announced as part of the budget in 2003 will work and is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Minister received criticism for flagging up decentralisation for his constituency. He should have been complimented on it. Delivering the message is part of what everyone in this House is about. I do not know where the criticism regarding his information on his constituents came from, but he is to be complimented on getting that message out. My only comment is that he borders my constituency and, if there is any overflow there, I am sure that Castlecomer will be well equipped to take those numbers from him. Perhaps that is an aspect of decentralisation which we should examine &mdash; where there has been a negative impact on employment. For example, in Castlecomer, a factory has closed down and there is little industry there or potential for employment. Decentralisation offers so much in that context that we should take a fresh look at those areas as the Minister rolls out decentralisation. If there is anyone from the Opposition who does not want those numbers, they should be directed towards such areas.</P>
      <P>It offers people the opportunity to work from home too. The efficient and wise use of information technology allows people to do that. Work need not be centred on one location. We can deal with it in that way. I have seen this at work in the Department of Education and Science in Athlone. The other day, for example, people who could not attend a meeting in Dublin participated in it by using information technology in their offices. We need to show the way in e-government, including local government. We will achieve much greater efficiency in that regard, provided all the necessary safeguards, security, training and information are in place.</P>
      <P>We now demand much more from our public service, local authorities and health boards. The Committee of Public Accounts, for example, demands greater accountability, while the public demands larger and wider programmes for the expenditure allocated. We must examine the types of assistance public bodies can be given in terms of information technology and speed up the process. In the United States, special advisers are available to the President to enable policy to be moved forward quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they the people who told the President about the weapons of mass destruction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The same applies in other European countries. The report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources specifically asks that these kinds of resources be made available. We could be to the fore in the European Union in developing e-government, including local <Col N="579"/>government, and decentralisation will be an important factor in delivering it.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, those involved in the provision of services, the county development plan and so forth, are anxious to embrace the whole decentralisation package and ensure it is delivered sooner rather than later. My experience of those working in centralised offices in Dublin has been that they are more that interested in getting out of the capital and into the country in order that they can have a better quality of life.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine a specific area which falls within the remit of the Office Public Works. D&uacute;chas is an important part of the workings of Government and, as I am aware from my work on the Committee of Public Accounts, it has transferred between Departments several times, including recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It may have been abolished but, having moved through local government, some of the officials have returned to the Office of Public Works. I ask the Minister of State to examine this element of the OPW because significant efficiency could be achieved in terms of expenditure by streamlining its excellent, skilful workforce which has served its Departments well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The heritage aspect of the Department must be structured much better. The Department's human resources section should examine the structure of the service with a view to ensuring that the people on the ground, those who restore monuments and work in restored monuments such as park attendants and guided tour leaders, have a career path available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We had that before the Government abolished it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Civil servants must be able to see clearly that they can move from one position to another with ease and those outside the Civil Service must be able to see how they use their skills to engage more easily and better with the system.</P>
      <P>The heritage element of the Department needs to be dragged from the Dark Ages, as it were, into the modern system of delivering services on the ground with which we are familiar. In doing so, significant areas of duplication could be eliminated and efficiency savings achieved. Regardless of whether it came within the remit of the Office of Public Works or local government or was a distinct entity, as was the case with D&uacute;chas, this area of government has continually cropped up at the Committee of Public Works. I urge the Minister of State to examine it as those <Col N="580"/>involved would greatly appreciate modernisation from the ground up.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to pursue the decentralisation policy, which is welcome throughout the country, as speedily as possible because it will have considerable economic benefits to all involved. I encourage him to consider including in the decentralisation programme areas such as Castlecomer, which is experiencing a downturn in the local employment market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>As the debate will adjourn in a few moments, I will pick up on Deputy Perry's comments on the modernisation of the public service, particularly the Civil Service. The introduction of risk management systems in all Departments and State agencies was part and parcel of the implementation of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service. As I understand the risk management systems, each Department should be either well advanced or have completed a risk assessment of the decentralisation proposals announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day.</P>
      <P>I also understand this assessment should include an assessment of the strategic risks involved in the proposed decentralisation, including the impact on the intellectual assets of individual Departments. If, for example, only 10% of the staff of a Department wishes to move to the location to which it has been designated and it must be supplemented by transfers from other Departments, the Department will suffer a loss of intellectual assets. I understand this is assessable and, therefore, I presume the Departments are carrying out such risk assessments if they have not already done so.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I presume the Departments are carrying out or have completed an assessment of the operational risks associated with decentralisation. The T&aacute;naiste acknowledged that decentralisation would result in a loss of service to the customer or consumer, at least in the short term. I presume each Department is carrying out a full assessment of the risks involved in this regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o'clock</TimeSt><P>I also presume an assessment is being carried out of the financial risks associated with decentralisation. What, for example, will be the total cost of the package? I expect that such an assessment must rely on the historical experience of decentralisation. For example, with regard to the transfer of a Department or part thereof to Sligo, how many staff moved and were recruited? How many changes of personnel or job or people changes were required to achieve the required numbers? What is the total cost associated with the process? What, for example, will be the cost in terms of travel time and travel costs for Departments, as distinct from the risks on the reputation side?</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to each Department to find out what progress has <Col N="581"/>been made in carrying out these risk assessments. The reason I did so was that Members had engaged in considerable discussion on the ultimate impact of the programme on the quality of the delivery of public services and whether it would increase or decrease efficiency and costs. There are formal ways of establishing which of these is the case. I expect that Secretaries General, who did not have more than perhaps 48 hours advance knowledge of the decentralisation announcement and were clearly not involved in making or giving advice on what was a political decision made in advance of the budget, will have carried out the formal assessments by now.</P>

    <P el="0" Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance).   </P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cregan, Glennon, O'Donnell, Carey and Se&aacute;n Power.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on a subject that has been debated in an ill-informed manner in recent weeks. Before discussing the substantive issue I wish to relate a personal experience in the 2002 general election. Voting was held on the Friday and the count commenced on Saturday morning. It was obvious from the initial figures of the first count that I was in the fortunate position of knowing that I was certain of being elected. My election team, family and friends had to wait from Saturday morning until Sunday evening to hear a declaration of my election. We can do better in this day and age. Two other Deputies in my constituency were in the very unfortunate position that 48 hours after counting commenced, they did not know who would be the last two Deputies elected.</P>
      <P>In my neighbouring constituency &mdash; Deputy Cregan can testify to this &mdash; Senator Finucane, formerly Deputy Finucane, lost out on spoiled votes, votes which were inadvertently spoiled by people leaving the polling booth under the unfortunate but happy illusion, as far as they were concerned, that they had voted for certain people. An analysis of those spoiled votes showed that the then Deputy Finucane lost his seat. Ten days after the last general election we did not know who would form the Government. We can and should do better than this.</P>
      <P>Some people inside and outside this House are propagating the myth that somehow we are replacing a perfect system with an imperfect one. We are all aware from our experience in these matters that the present system is far from perfect. The events of the last general election such as the delayed counts, the threats of going to the High Court and examination of ballot papers against the light and the involvement of senior counsel undermine the democratic and electoral process.</P><Col N="584"/>
      <P>If this system was entirely new I would have a lot of sympathy for Fine Gael and Labour and the other Opposition parties in their concerns. If the Opposition had campaigned vigorously on this since it was first introduced into this country, I would have a lot of sympathy for them. If the Opposition Deputies who failed to be elected in the 2002 general election by electronic voting had disputed the efficacy and efficiency of that system, I would have a lot of sympathy for them. It is difficult to escape the suspicion if not the conclusion that all these issues are raised now by the Opposition for purely political motives. That is obvious and I believe it has become obvious to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We raised it three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy Gilmore that last night his leader made a statement in the House as follows, &ldquo;When it comes to counting the votes, I do not trust Fianna F&aacute;il.&rdquo; I have been a Member of this House for only a wet week &mdash; 18 months &mdash; but that is the most ludicrous statement I have heard since I came into the House. With those words Deputy Rabbitte demonstrated clearly and conclusively that this has nothing to do with the efficiency and efficacy of the system, it has everything to do with propagating a false myth and cynicism among the electorate. I suspect, and I believe I am correct, that what Deputy Rabbitte wants to do is to create a scenario where if people have doubts about the system &mdash; as promoted in the Nice referendum, if in doubt, vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; &mdash; if in doubt about electronic voting, they should vote against the Government parties in the local elections. That is what the Opposition is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only Fianna F&aacute;il who wants to bring it in. Nobody wants it except Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The contributions of the Labour Party are labelled with hysteria. On the other hand, Fine Gael's contributions are laced with a heavy dose of hypocrisy. I have a copy of a Fine Gael hand-out from the 2002 general election which was distributed to the electorate in Meath. It supports and encourages people to engage with and to use electronic voting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The key issue is the efficiency and the efficacy of the system. My initial remarks show that the system we have at present is an imperfect system. Its replacement is a much better system and I support its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the introduction of electronic voting. I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and his predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on their hands-on approach to pushing this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Minister have a hands-on effect when he is in Malaysia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental purpose of the initiative is to improve the efficiency, speed, accuracy and user-friendliness of Irish elections and to eliminate the democratic wastage associated with spoiled votes, of which there were more than 20,000 at the last general election. It is about more than just improving the technology. By modernising and transforming elections in a visible way, the opportunity is created to tackle voter apathy and improve the image of elections, especially with regard to an increasingly younger electorate.</P>
      <P>The new voting system was extensively piloted at the 2002 general election and the second Nice referendum, involving the equivalent to 400,000 voters. The reaction of users has been overwhelmingly positive, despite the fact that some commentators said that elderly people would be afraid to use the system. On the contrary, it was welcomed with enthusiasm. No significant complaint or challenge about the fairness or integrity of the process has been made by any candidate or voter in the constituencies covered by electronic voting.</P>
      <P>The State's responsibility is to provide facilities for the electorate to vote, and this is what electoral arrangements have always done and continue to do. The electronic voting system <Col N="586"/>makes it easier for a person to vote and easier for a voter to amend in secret his or her preferences if he or she makes a mistake before pressing the &ldquo;Cast Vote&rdquo; button. The electronic system will eliminate all spoiled votes which previously arose inadvertently, for instance, from incorrect marking or non-stamping of ballot papers by polling station staff. No person should be entitled to spoil his or her vote. They should either vote for or against, or stay at home. We should not facilitate in any shape or fashion a person who spoils his or her vote.</P>
      <P>My colleague mentioned Limerick West and I wish to speak about my colleague, Senator Finucane, who unfortunately lost his seat to another colleague by one vote. There were several blocks of unmarked, unstamped ballot papers. That may have happened by design or it may have happened for a reason. A block of 70 ballot papers were not stamped by the presiding officer. Former Deputy Finucane could have got five, ten or 20 votes and he could have won a D&aacute;il seat. That cannot happen with the new system. In other constituencies presiding officers inadvertently or otherwise did not stamp ballot papers and spoiled votes for people who intended to cast their votes. The introduction of the system has not been rushed. It has taken place in easy steps over a number of years, with the pilot schemes which I have mentioned. The system has been independently verified as safe and reliable in six checks conducted by six reputable companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The companies were appointed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what Governments do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>The system proved its reliability when it was used 70 million times internationally and at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The companies should have been selected by an independent commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be the most accurate and the most democratic system we have ever had. I would like to speak briefly about the concept of a paper trail. I have attended committee meetings with colleagues from this side of the House, as well as Deputies Allen, Gilmore and others who have given a great deal of their time to this issue, which they take seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has become obvious to me from attending such meetings that there is a distinct possibility that one will not get the same result from examining a paper trail as one will get from the electronic voting process. The form of random selection used in the paper trail involves manual voting and counting, whereas the random selection used under electronic voting is different. <Col N="587"/>One cannot use both systems &mdash; it has to be one or the other. It has been argued that when one has cast one's vote, one could be given a receipt outlining the order in which one expressed one's preferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are not arguing for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think such a system would lead to corruption and confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is arguing for such a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would detract from the secrecy of one's ballot. There have been strong levels of intimidation by certain political parties in this country, and such intimidation will be more likely if people are asked to cast a vote and then to show a receipt to prove who they voted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not claim that Deputy Gilmore has made such a suggestion, but some people have argued that one's vote should be verified by means of a till receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The receipt could be placed in a sealed drum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that such a system detracts from the secrecy of the sealed ballot and should not be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>How can placing a receipt in a sealed drum detract from the secrecy of the ballot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for one's vote to be verified by the machine. When one presses the &ldquo;Cast Vote&rdquo; button to cast one's vote, one's choice should be flashed up on the screen before the vote is stored. The message should state that one has chosen to vote for certain candidates in a certain order. One would then leave the polling booth in the knowledge that the vote one intended to cast has been cast, recorded and stored. In this technological age, it should be possible to examine this possibility. If this system is possible, I believe that it should be introduced so that one's vote can be verified and one's doubts can be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude by speaking about the Government's decision to put in place an independent panel. The Government accepts the need to ensure that there is utmost confidence in our electoral system. In response to concerns raised about the proposal of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government has decided to establish an independent panel to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the arrangements proposed for electronic voting.</P>

	<P>There will not be any up and unders. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak against the motion moved last night by Deputy Kenny. As one of the 12 Members of the House who were elected at the 2002 general election by votes that were cast electronically, I contrast my experience with that of my colleague, Deputy Peter Power, who was also elected for the first time two years ago &mdash; Deputy Power had to wait for a considerable time to be elected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of his constituency colleagues had to wait a lot longer. I was fortunate to have been elected approximately four hours after the close of polling, even though some considerable delay was involved due to teething problems with the system. I fail to see how counts such as those in Limerick West or Cork South-Central, which dragged on for a week, should be acceptable to anybody in this day and age. Politics is enough of a blood sport between elections without adding to this aspect of it at election time, regardless of the entertainment content for the masses. I do not agree with the view that such entertainment is good for voter participation. It may be good for persons in a certain age group who are interested and experienced in elections, but we must do everything we can to ensure that the political system is as accessible as possible to those in an important age cohort, in which there has been a significant reduction in voting and interest in politics and a dramatic increase in cynicism about the political system.</P><Col N="589"/>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to correct a mistaken notion which has been in the public domain since the night of 17 May 2002. We are all familiar with the famous photograph of my constituency colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan, and the former Deputy Nora Owen, which was taken immediately after the Dublin North result was announced. We are aware that the drama of the situation caused the photograph to be taken. The returning officer for the Dublin North constituency has been unfairly maligned for his part in the particular circumstances of that night. The impression has clearly been given that it was his fault in some way, or the fault of the system, that the traumatic situation arose. My clear recollection is that this was not the case. Just before the result was due to be announced, the returning officer asked the candidates, as a group, if they wished to be informed of the result privately or publicly. Perhaps the candidates' decision to proceed with the announcement in the manner in which it was then delivered was taken in error, but it was our decision nonetheless. It cannot be said that the actions of the county registrar led to the unfortunate scenes that ensued, as the opposite was the case. It is important that I make this statement publicly as I do not think it has been said heretofore.</P>
      <P>Two issues relating to electronic voting are worthy of further emphasis. Many people have spoken of the democratic right to deliberately spoil one's vote, but I think it is dramatically overstated. A small percentage of voters exert that right. The vast majority of spoiled votes are spoiled accidentally. My experience and that of my constituents has been that the new system is extremely user-friendly in that regard. I emphasise that there were no spoiled votes in the Dublin North constituency in the general election of 2002. Perhaps some people wanted to spoil their votes but did not bother to do so, but the vast majority of spoiled votes result from an accident rather than a deliberate act.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that a viable argument can be made for a verifiable paper audit trail. The loud group of activists which is seeking a paper trail is comparing the proposed and piloted system in this country with several different systems in the United States. They are not comparing like with like. We have not received complaints as a result of the 2002 general election. There were some minor teething problems &mdash; I do not belittle in any way the traumatic experience of my constituency colleague, Mrs. Nora Owen &mdash; but the reality is that we have a good and modern system. If we are to make politics more relevant to the age cohort about which there is so much concern, we must proceed with an electronic electoral system as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion because it has brought attention to the issue of electronic voting which has so far gone unnoticed by the public. For this reason, the motion has been of immense benefit.</P><Col N="590"/>
      <P>The most important and critical aspect of this issue is winning the public's confidence in electronic voting. Establishing that confidence has not been made easier by the variety of expert opinions brought before various committees of the House. It is like a lawyer's opinion; each one has an opinion and it is seen as gospel. This leaves us with the choice of deciding which one we believe.</P>
      <P>During the previous Administration, the House agreed in principle to introduce electronic voting. Its introduction can hardly be described as rushed as the legalisation dated from 2001 and, in the 2002 election, some constituencies had experience of the system. The experience of the Dublin North constituency, alluded to already, demonstrated how both cruel and crude the pilot system was. In light of that experience, the pilot scheme has proved to be a valuable lesson and the system has been modified. It must now be put to a further test and this can only be done through an election.</P>
      <P>Unlike some Members, I believe in the right to spoil a vote. Participation includes the ability to spoil a vote. If large numbers of the electorate spoil their votes, it tells us something about the system because they have gone to the trouble of participating in it. We may not be happy with their full participation, but spoiling a vote is equally valid in making a statement. The recognition of this in the Government's amendment to the motion is important.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's comments on the paper trail. One is either choosing one or the other system. One cannot sit on the fence and have an electronic system on the one hand and a paper one on the other. If one is asking people to have confidence in a system, one must ask them to have confidence in the automatic system rather than the paper one if it is progress we want. I do not agree with the request for a paper trail verification.</P>
      <P>Random selection was referred to in the Minister's speech. I believed that one of the benefits of the new system was that there would be absolute accuracy in transfers. I am grateful to Deputy Gilmore who has explained that it is not the case. I recommend and will insist that it does become the case. I am not sure if it will be modified because, as Deputy Gilmore explained, of the reasons for random selection in the previous election. If electronic voting is to be introduced, there must be complete and accurate transferability of votes because it is the greatest merit of such a system.</P>
      <P>I will lament the passing of the blood sport of the tally and the count. I enjoyed it because it was all part of the experience. The one time when I was subjected to it, I was grateful that it was clear I was to be elected. However, I have enjoyed many counts where the results were not clear. As an avid campaigner for many years, the drama around the tally and the wait for the count was always part of the enjoyment. I will miss it.</P><Col N="591"/>
      <P>It is the young electorate on whom we are most focused. They will also be the most enthused by electronic voting. I have concerns for the elderly, which is probably one of the reasons such a lavish public relations campaign has been undertaken. The issue of how the public relations contracts were awarded should not cloud the issue of the principle of the introduction of electronic voting, as the Opposition has done. It does a disservice to the function of electronic voting. These issues should not be clouded and brought together. It is important that political parties arrive at a consensus for this new voting system as it cannot be seen as a Government-forced decision. There are probably one or two Members opposed to electronic voting. However, most Members recognise that it is the way forward. I find the Opposition's objections perplexing because concessions were made in an attempt to arrive at a consensus on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The D&aacute;il and Seanad gave approval for the introduction of electronic voting when the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 was passed. Following that, the Government introduced electronic voting on a trial basis in three constituencies in the previous general election and in four constituencies for the second Nice referendum. There was widespread approval for the system. On that basis, the Government decided to proceed with introducing electronic voting for all elections. In October 2002, it made it clear that was the road to be taken.</P>
      <P>When Deputies Allen and Gilmore raised concerned about the system several months ago, the Committee on the Environment and Local Government decided to deal with the matter in some detail. A number of experts came before the committee who made excellent presentations and opened our eyes to some of the details. However, no matter what system is introduced, there will be faults. There is no such thing as a perfect system and there are many deficiencies in the one we have used. As we are all Members, we have benefited from them but we cannot be blinkered and must realise the serious deficiencies that existed.</P>
      <P>People have expressed concerns about introducing the new system. It is vital that the system introduced is not just good enough for Members but also for the public to have confidence in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Electronic voting is the way all elections will operate in the years ahead. The secrecy of the ballot is assured and there is no linkage between the electoral register and the voting machine. Those in the Dublin North constituency were the small group who used it in the previous general election. I recall Cathal Boland's slogan, &ldquo;Boland on the Button&rdquo;. I was in the RTE studios on the famous election night when the former Deputy, Ms Nora Owen, lost her seat. It was not a happy sight to see some of the shots that fortunately did not go on air.</P>
      <P>This morning, I heard Marian Finucane on RTE saying that, as few people are turning out to vote, we should stick with the same system. That does not make sense. It is important that voter participation, especially among young people, is increased. I believe many elderly people will vote through this system. Up to 30 million people voted electronically in &ldquo;I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here&rdquo;. On RTE every Sunday night, people vote electronically for &ldquo;You're A Star&rdquo;. People use 365 Banking and they can send text messages to beat the band. We must not be condescending to the electorate as it is sophisticated and will know how exactly to vote.</P>
      <P>I was not a great fan of the blood sport of the count. Our friends in the press gallery got more mileage out of the trauma we underwent, and sold more books because of it, than any enjoyment we derived. Let us not hanker after an imperfect system. It is important that we have this independent panel and that we scrutinise properly, and have absolute faith in the system. We need a more participative democracy.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of confusion between electronic voting and e-voting, a distinction which Deputy Gilmore expressed very clearly. We should move towards e-voting but let us take it one step at a time. I support the Government amendment to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gregory, Healy, Connolly and Morgan.</P>
      <P>I was one of the first Deputies to call for the introduction of electronic voting, following the famous recount for my seat in Dublin South-East in 1997. I must disagree with Deputy O'Malley <Col N="593"/>on this because having endured that blood sport, having been that soldier, I can report it is not humane. This is perhaps the only point on which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and I could agree. It is about time that we did introduced electronic voting. I said that it would eliminate the uncertainty, the discrepancies, the spoilt votes and give us a pure form of proportional representation. In theory all of this should be true but unfortunately electronic voting as introduced by this Government will serve only to increase the uncertainty.</P>
      <P>My party unequivocally supports the principle of electronic voting. Many of the party members are interested in technology and many of them, including Mr. John Lambe whose letter appeared today in <i>The Irish Times,</i> have raised serious questions about the methodology employed by the Government. The key issue as has been repeatedly emphasised is the lack of a verifiable paper audit trail. It would increase the voter's confidence in the system as it would show directly that the choice made by the voter was printed on a hard copy and would be deposited in the ballot box. That is what we want because for all our IT literacy skill, people like the reassurance of the hard copy. If they did not, the concept of the paperless office would have made great advances by now.</P>
      <P>The Government must choose between the convenience of the operation and the confidence of the voter. Our proposal is slightly more inconvenient than the Government's proposal but it increases the confidence of the voter in the process. If I understood the Taoiseach correctly this morning when he spoke on this, he argued that the printing sometimes can go wrong but if that is so, computers too can go wrong. The difference is that if one has a printer one sees the error. If the computer is wrong, one has no way of knowing without a verifiable ballot whether the vote one cast has been registered properly. That is the key argument in this debate.</P>
      <P>Our system of PR is a complex and brilliant one which is fair, democratic and has served the people well over many generations. It has been so democratic and fair that Fianna F&aacute;il twice attempted to get rid of it. For these and other reasons many people do not trust this Government when it comes to changing the way we vote. Its intransigence in the face of such reasonable opposition only increases the suspicion that an unscrupulous Government could use the electronic voting system for its own ends, to maintain power. This is not fanciful. If it is technologically possible then obviously in the absence of a verifiable paper audit trail, it is a distinct possibility. The aim, therefore, of the Opposition is to remove any suspicion that something could be amiss. To ensure fairness and increase confidence in a system which in principle we support, it is time that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, <Col N="594"/>Deputy Cullen, and the Taoiseach started to listen to the concerns of ordinary people and acted on those concerns. It is not too late to change direction. I urge the Government to rethink this. It is under serious pressure on this issue.</P>
      <P>There is a very disturbing letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today from one of my constituents, Mr. Joe McCarthy of Claremont Road in Sandymount, saying that the Minister of State has tried as best he can to prevent him getting information on this issue under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. That is very regrettable. This man has long experience in the technology trade, has a wide knowledge of computers, is committed to democracy and is only trying to make things better. All of us in this House should be committed to democracy. If we are committed democrats the Government should change course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the proposed system for electronic voting on two grounds. First, the system does not have a back-up checkable record of votes cast in the polling stations. There must be a voter verifiable audit trail whereby the voting machine prints a record of each vote for the voter to see and then stores it in a ballot box. That is the very basis of the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Second, I oppose the Government's proposed system because it is a scandalous waste of &euro;45 million for no apparent reason. A handful of marathon recounts in the last few elections is hardly a sufficient basis on which to squander up to &euro;50 million of taxpayers' money when there are so many other real areas of need whose funding this Government is cutting back. Schools, hospitals, child care, the elderly and, for example, the unfortunate polio sufferers we saw on the RTE news this evening could have benefited from the millions of euro which are being wasted on machines that will be used a couple of times every five years or so.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wished to reform the voting system he would have done far better to have concentrated his efforts on the electoral register and the identification requirements for persons casting their vote. I raised this issue numerous times in parliamentary questions and the standard reply I received was that the matter was under review but as the present system is working satisfactorily there was no pressing need to change it. The same logic could have been better applied to electronic voting. It is extremely odd that if a citizen wishes to obtain a resident's parking disc he or she must supply items of identification on a rigidly applied basis but to cast a vote and elect a D&aacute;il and a Government no such requirement is applied except very randomly. At every election, candidates are elected on a margin of a handful of votes and Governments are placed in power by a small margin of seats. If the Minister is genuinely interested in the more effective and democratic running of elections these are the issues he should address: <Col N="595"/>streamlining the reliability of the electoral register and ensuring that those who vote are entitled to do so and cast only one vote each.</P>
      <P>Electronic voting can wait as it will have to do, for example, in Britain where the electoral commission has decided it is premature. We are told that following pilot studies on machines rented from the returning officer in Dublin, it has decided that the Powervote system as proposed here should not be used until it is safe. Deputy Joe Higgins argued over a year ago that the Government's proposed system is more appropriate to Robert Mugabe than to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not at all sure of the necessity for this electronic voting system on the basis that as it is not broken, why fix it? I am not satisfied that the system we have is broken. As Deputy Gregory said, a few long counts or recounts in elections in the recent past seem to have brought about a certain urgency on this issue. The spending of &euro;40 million or &euro;45 million on the introduction of electronic voting is unnecessary and a waste of money which could be used for many other purposes.</P>
      <P>There must be public trust in the system and consensus about its introduction. The introduction of the system must be overseen by an independent electoral commission which is above politics and which has the trust of all political parties and none in the House and of the public. I am satisfied that to ensure the system is fair and balanced there must be a verifiable audit paper trail. That is essential if the system is introduced. It is regrettable that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is introducing this system while he is the director of elections for his party in the forthcoming European and local elections. I oppose the introduction of electronic voting in its current form. I support the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion and I would have signed it if I had been asked to do so. We must recognise that the pilot scheme at the last general election was relatively successful. However, the results were badly delivered, which Deputy Glennon mentioned earlier. We must remember it was a pilot programme, but we must ask ourselves if we have learned anything from it. We have been warned about the potential failures in the system and the fact that it is wide open to the threat of rogue hacking and vote tampering. We cannot ignore that. There is no doubt that electronic voting is the way forward, but we should get it right before the people are asked to use it. It is important to build safeguards into the system and that the people trust it. We should not forget that when electronic equipment makes a mistake, it is usually a huge one.</P>
      <P>People are more aware of what is happening in this regard. Recent tests in Maryland in the USA <Col N="596"/>showed that computer hackers enjoyed <i>carte blanche</i> and were able to cast multiple votes with impunity and to neutralise the vote recording mechanisms in machines. Everyone who spoke this evening mentioned verification, which is one of the big issues. Should we trust the machine or should there be some form of verification of the information recorded? It is essential to have some type of audit trail. There is a paper trail of every electronic transaction. It is like doing the lottery. There is no reason the machine could not give the result after the numbers are pressed in the same way as the lottery machines. The American experience of electronic voting gives us little reason to believe or have confidence in the integrity of the proposed system. To maximise the security of voting machines, there should be a print-out.</P>
      <P>We should remember those who are disabled, particularly those who are visually impaired, when considering a new voting system. There should be a system whereby if a person touches a photograph of a candidate, the name will appear on a screen. That would allow disabled people to vote with dignity without the necessity to have someone with them. It is important to consider that.</P>
      <P>The scope for vote tampering with the current manual system was limited to ballots at local level. The infallibility of source codes was thrown sharply into focus in the past week with the unauthorised release on to the Internet of the Microsoft Windows operating system's source code. That has necessitated the urgent publication and worldwide dissemination of a repair patch by Microsoft.</P>
      <P>I propose that all voting machines should produce a voter verified paper and that manual random checks should be held in 20% of constituencies, regardless of whether there is a need for a count or the result has been established. We should check the machine and the paper and publish the results after the election results have been announced. Open software must be used in voting systems and wireless communication devices should be banned. Electronic voting systems should be easily assessed by the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that the issue of electronic voting is being handled by the most arrogant Minister in the Government. He has done his utmost to ram through this unnecessary and fundamental change in how we vote while, at the same time, attempting to stifle debate on its potential dangers and implications. I hope the Minister returns from his United Nations engagement in Malaysia with an improved and enlightened attitude to the importance of consultation, discussion and consensus with representatives of the people on issues which fundamentally affect the democratic process.</P><Col N="597"/>
      <?oasys _fc?><P>Sinn F&eacute;in raised concerns about the electronic voting process at an early stage. The announcement yesterday by the Government that it had decided to establish an independent panel to verify secrecy and to deal with the issue of individuals who wish to abstain fails to deal with the central concern, namely, the necessity to provide a paper trail. One wonders what this independent board will be able to achieve in the limited time available between now and the elections in June. Numerous questions must be asked about this board. What power will it have? Who will be on it and who will appoint the members? Why is it not possible to have a fully independent electoral commission, which was the request of most parties on this side of the House? Given the Minister's behaviour in awarding the contract for the public information campaign, can we trust him with the proposed board?</P>
      <P>There are many outstanding questions about the awarding of the &euro;4 million contract for the promotion of electronic voting to the Q4 public relations company, which is part owned by the former Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary. I expect the Minister to comment on this in his reply to the debate. Is it true that the Q4 public relations company was only incorporated as a limited company on 21 May 2003? Is it the case that a company tendering for public contracts is required to submit evidence of turnover for three years and financial security, banking details etc. for a number of years to demonstrate capacity to complete the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not if the person is in Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that is the case. As that could not have been the case with a company which is less than one year old, will the Minister confirm whether these requirements were met in full? Did the Minister turn a blind eye to these requirements because of the involvement of a former general secretary of Fianna F&aacute;il? This issue must be clarified. It could be an innocent incident, but I would like to hear the Minister's explanation of such an important and fundamental issue.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the idea of electronic voting using a kiosk type system. However, we call for all source code and design to be publicly available for inspection by citizens and particularly by computer science experts. For the Mercuri method to be applied, a paper trail and a paper copy of the vote verified by the voter must be held for the purpose of an independent recount. If electronic voting is to gain public confidence, as it should, serious concerns about the system being introduced in the State must be addressed as a matter of urgency. The fact that the source code is not available to computer professionals means it cannot be verified that it does what it says it should do. A computer, for example, can be made to display one thing, record another and print a third. If the code is only available to a private company, the report raises the possibility <Col N="598"/>of sabotage from within the company by placing a programmer within that company.</P>
      <P>There is no opposition to introducing electronic voting in this State. We are all in favour of it, but it must be done right. It should not be messed up in the way it is currently. If this is seen by the public as merely an attempt by the Government to plaster over the deep concerns about the electronic voting system, it will undoubtedly further erode public confidence in the voting system. If we want a truly democratic and representative electoral system, we must address the issue of voter turn-out. Many people in rural parts of this State are being disenfranchised because of the requirement for voters attempting to get on the supplementary register to have the form stamped by their local garda. It is difficult for people living in rural communities to get on the supplementary register because local Garda stations have been closed. Would the Minister consider amending this legislation to remove this requirement or at least to allow it to be done at a post office?</P>

It is regrettable that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is also unavoidably absent as he bears much responsibility for the position we are now in. A number of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers tried to indicate that Fine Gael and other Opposition parties were opposed to electronic voting. We are not opposed to the principle of electronic voting. However, we want it done right and want to ensure it is done above board in such a manner that the general public can have trust in the system. If we cannot have trust in our democratic system we are going nowhere.</P>
      <P>Since this motion on electronic voting was tabled, the Government parties have been forced into a partial climb down. The proposed establishment of a committee to examine electronic voting only goes a small way and does not satisfy us. Nothing short of in independent electoral commission and a printout of the ballot paper to go into a separate box for verification purposes would satisfy the general public at this stage. Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers should have grasped that the general public have lost confidence in anything politicians do from any side of the House. This is because of what has been exposed as having happened at the highest level in Fianna F&aacute;il in the past ten or 12 years, which is only now being exposed. This is why the general public cannot trust anything that is not verifiably tested.</P><Col N="599"/>
      <P>One of my colleagues on the Opposition benches asked why we should fix something that was not broken. We should not interfere with our electoral system unless we have fully tested the system to replace it. While we are all for modern IT, etc., the matter must be fully tested so that everybody has confidence in it. When a Government has been in office continually for a period, it can lose track of itself and get so arrogant that it believes it can do what it likes when it has a majority. That is what has happened in this case. Twice in the past when Fianna F&aacute;il was in Government for long periods, it tried to abolish our PR electoral voting system. The public rejected it on both occasions and on this occasion the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is trying to bulldoze this system through.</P>
      <P>Initially I could not understand what was the hurry. However, this became clear and I then lost confidence in what the Minister was doing. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, I would have liked that committee to have been able to unanimously support a system for electronic voting. However, we did not get the opportunity to do that. As some members of the committee had concerns about some aspects of electronic voting, we arranged a meeting involving officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, representatives of the manufacturer and independent IT experts.</P>
      <P>We met on the morning of 18 December and had a very useful exchange of views. Some questions were posed and we adjourned for lunch. We were due to resume after lunch for an afternoon session and were scheduled to meet early in January when 41 questions posed by the IT experts could be answered. While the Minister was not present at the committee, he was in the building and keeping in touch. Immediately after lunch, the Government members of the committee proposed we should proceed with the system without having to wait for the answers to the 41 questions and the meeting was terminated within ten or 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>On 19 December, the contract for the machines was signed. Following information obtained by Joe McCarthy under the Freedom of Information Act, and other information we obtained subsequently, we discovered that not alone was the contract signed on 19 December, but also that 20 million worth of machines had been delivered here before the contract had been signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was very slick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>When I found out about this kind of carry on, the Minister lost my confidence. To have the machines delivered before the committee agreed, before the D&aacute;il agreed and before the contract was signed shows the arrogance of the Minister. This is unheard of. I repeat a question I asked at the committee. <Col N="600"/>Where were the Government watchdogs, the Progressive Democrats, when all this was going on? The Progressive Democrats have woken up in the past few days and not because of what we are saying here. Just as contributing at the committee was a waste of time, so is speaking here tonight because we know the Government majority will defeat the joint Opposition motion.</P>
      <P>However, we need to consider the general public. It is not possible to defeat the general public. The public have lost confidence in this IT system and the Minister should slow down and take heed of this. This was the reason the Progressive Democrats forced the Government into the slight face-saving climb down of establishing a committee to examine the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister was determined to proceed with purchasing the machines regardless. What was driving him to do so in spite of the reservations expressed and the failure of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to agree? He proceeded because he had already made up his mind and was already committed. He had 20 million worth of machines in the country before anybody made a decision to proceed with this system. The public want answers to this and will not be satisfied with a committee appointed by the Government to examine it.</P>
      <P>As nobody has been killed, there is plenty of time for the Minister to call a halt. As the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said this week in another context, how wonderful it would be if politicians could bring themselves to admit they are only fallible and not God. By this definition they can make mistakes. The Minister will not be diminished by admitting to having made a mistake. He should acknowledge the public have no confidence in this electronic system. This is not because they have no confidence in electronic business and machines in general. They have no confidence in the manner in which this issue was pushed through the committee. They have no confidence because the 41 questions have not yet been answered two months after they were posed.</P>
      <P>How could the general public have confidence in the system? How could the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers expect the public to have confidence in a Government or even in politicians when they see what has been going on in the past ten years? This is what has eroded the confidence of the general public in anything politicians propose. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who is the director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il is spearheading this campaign. If it were spearheaded by an independent electoral commission, perhaps it would have support and we might have got the answers to the questions we asked.</P>
      <P>I offer the Minister some friendly advice. He should back down now before it is too late. The Minister will not gain the confidence of the <Col N="601"/>people by trying to push this through. Unfortunately he is absent tonight. I hope the investigation committee that will be established to look at this is merely a red herring to give the Minister an excuse to back down. If that is the case I will be the first to congratulate the Minister. If he backs down he will not lose face and will help to restore the confidence of the general public in this Parliament and its committees. He will never win the confidence of the people given the way he is going about this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion and amendment. Ireland is a modern nation; we have come a long way. Technology plays an important part in our everyday lives. In my constituency in County Clare, where Ennis was chosen as the information age town in 1997, PC penetration is twice the national average. Eight out of ten residents use the Internet. Nationally, ATMs are no longer found only on the street but are now available in-house in many food stores. Twenty-four hour banking is available to customers. Soon we will be able to tax our cars on the Internet. We book our flights on it as well. For all these transactions we receive receipts. As my party leader, Deputy Kenny, said during the debate, under the system proposed by the Government one casts one's vote by pressing the button and hopes for the best.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o'clock</TimeSt><P>A leaflet about electronic voting was recently published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There should be no doubt that the people are ready for electronic voting, but the Government is not. It has failed to consult, seek agreement on the issue or answer important questions. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, launched his electronic voting campaign in a blaze of glory at the Mansion House two weeks ago. The publicity alone cost &euro;5 million. However, within 24 hours, he was forced to have his glossy leaflets reprinted because the image clearly showed a voter casting his vote for Fianna F&aacute;il. I thank our party spokesperson, Deputy Allen, who noticed that.</P>
      <P>Little thought went into this leaflet, just as little thought has gone into the electronic voting system. The system was rushed in because Deputy Cullen wants to be remembered as the Minister who introduced electronic voting nationwide. I have a word of caution for the Minister. He should remember what happened the Taoiseach in the Bertie Bowl fiasco. If the system goes wrong, the Taoiseach and the Minister must take full responsibility for their bullying tactics. We should remember the words of a senior official of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who warned last month that the rolling out of electronic voting for the local and European elections, which are only 14 or 15 weeks away, could be risky.</P><Col N="602"/>
      <P>We need openness and transparency from the Government. The questions and technical concerns raised by the experts must be answered. The Taoiseach has said that an independent panel will be appointed to deal with concerns raised. When will the panel be appointed? What will be its remit? Will it be allowed to examine the issue of a voter-verified paper audit trail? What provision is being made to train staff for the June elections, in light of the proposed new legislation, to deal with issues such as voter abstentions?</P>
      <P>The Government is now beginning to acknowledge the failures of its proposal because the public does not trust it. The public is asking questions. It is entitled to a fair and transparent system. All options must be considered. The voter is entitled to a receipt which could be verified in the event of a recount or any apparent irregularities. I urge the Minister to postpone the introduction of electronic voting so that the concerns of the political parties and the people may be dealt with. This is a democracy. Polling day belongs to the people. It is their day. It is the day on which every citizen over 18 has his or her say. The Minister should listen to them. After all, they elect us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not Luddites, but we believe this project is proceeding with indecent haste. We do not believe the necessary safeguards are in place. We simply wish to see a voter-verifiable audit trail put in place. I do not even insist on a paper audit trail. It could be a computer audit trail, but it must be verifiable.</P>
      <P>Many concerns have been expressed and there has been much hyperbole and rhetoric about the extent of those concerns. However, they are real. When professionals in the computing world bring those concerns to our attention, we should listen to them. When professionals from the accounting world tell us they use the principal of double-entry bookkeeping, we should listen to them. When professionals from the accounting world talk about doing a manual tot, even if one has an Excel spreadsheet in front of one, we should listen to them. The source code for these machines should be released. The myriad of examples of flaws from abroad point to the difficulties of the system. I believe it was Al Gore who, in a particular ward of one US state, received a vote of minus 20,000. It must be the ultimate indignity for a politician to receive minus votes. That certainly did not occur in the days before electronic voting.</P>
      <P>Within the Irish voting system there is a good hierarchy of understanding and knowledge, from the returning officer down to the individual who counts votes. That is being lost at the stroke of a key with what is being proposed. The Green Party wishes to see the introduction of electronic voting, but we do not believe the current safeguards are good enough and we wish to see its nationwide adoption postponed until the questions that have been asked are answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. I congratulate the Opposition parties for coming together on this motion. Unlike many others in the House, I have a fundamental suspicion of and objection to the whole concept of electronic voting. No reason put forward by the Government has been sufficient to convince me there is any need to go this road. There are other reasons, however.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said this morning that the Opposition appeared to wish to obstruct the modernisation of the voting system. I do not hear the public demanding modernisation of the voting system. If the Government wants to modernise, it could start with the health service. It could modernise the education system or the housing system or it could consider the problem of crime. It would spend its money well. The system of electronic voting is suspicious, expensive, unworkable and unverifiable. There is no system yet available under which the voter can be certain that the vote cast is the one that will be counted. That has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt.</P>
      <P>The other reason I have a deep suspicion about this proposal is the indecent haste which has been referred to by previous speakers. What is the rush? The Government could have improved the health service over a year and a half. This was urgently needed, but nobody did it. What is the real reason? This is what makes the public suspicious. The public, for one reason or another and not necessarily to do with elections, does not trust the Government. It is suspicious of the haste with which this legislation was introduced and it does not trust the motives of the Government. Why is this?</P>
      <P>Let us remember the dormant accounts issue. This was a good and holy cause and a great idea. An independent commission was established to disburse the funds from dormant accounts. First the total was said to be &euro;70 million, then &euro;200 million. Now it seems to be in the region of &euro;500 million, which is a sizeable sum. What did the Government do? It dispensed with the commission immediately. It handed the dormant accounts fund over to a Minister who will treat it as the national lottery fund has been treated over the last number of years. This was a despicable action, and it is despicable of the Government to expect the Opposition and the people to accept it. The people are deeply suspicious and, after the last previous general election, they have every right to be.</P>
      <P>Where are the guardians of democracy, the Progressive Democrats? I thought they would be campaigning for the process to be slowed down. I thought the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, would be up another telegraph pole calling for the people to come to his assistance to ensure they did not have this system forced upon them. Where is he? He is not even on the plinth. Where are all his party colleagues? Will the Progressive Democrats stand <Col N="604"/>up for democracy? Its members are supposed to be progressive and democratic. Will they stand up for the people? Will they tell them they will stand by them and ensure the Government of which they are part will not take from the people their right to vote in a secret ballot however they want?</P>
      <P>If we had been told by the people over the past ten or 12 years that they wanted electronic voting or if they had campaigned for it, there would have been a reason for it. All Members would have accepted the need for it in that situation. However, they did not come to us about it. They came to us about the health services, crime, housing, social welfare, taxation and every other issue but not about electronic voting. The first instance of electronic voting in these precincts was in this House, and it has failed on five occasions.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, said in his contribution last night that the new system would remove the arbitrary nature of the current surplus distribution rules of the PR-STV count system. This is a potential benefit of the new system. The Minister asked me to clarify that the existing count rules will continue to apply at the June polls and that examination of any revision of the count rules will take place after the June elections.</P>
      <P>Electronic voting and counting will provide a more modern, user-friendly and efficient system of voting to the people. The project has been advanced in a considered and thorough way from the legislation in 1999 and 2001 through to the procurement of a proven and robust system, together with comprehensive testing and successful piloting in Irish conditions. The system will be ready for countrywide roll-out at the June polls. However, to provide extra reassurance, the amended motion will put in place an independent group to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the system.</P>

	<P>Nevertheless, opponents of electronic voting want to deny, or at least to delay significantly, the delivery of these benefits to voters at this time. They want to obstruct <Col N="605"/>progress towards electronic voting because they say it needs a paper trail.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the experience and practicalities of electronic voting all over the world. Thousands of electoral administrations use electronic voting systems. Opposition speakers may wish to enlighten us about how many of these also use a paper audit trail. The answer is virtually none.</P>

	<P>Since 1922, it has been the task of the Legislature and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, acting under legislative authority, to determine arrangements for administering elections in Ireland. In this, the Oireachtas is accountable to the people and the Minister is accountable to this House.</P>
      <P>Conscious of our responsibilities to the people and to the electoral process, the amended motion supports the continued preparations being made for the full implementation of electronic voting and counting. Others have made it clear that they do not support this project. That is their privilege. However, final responsibility in this matter must and will be exercised democratically by these Houses.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has sought to suggest that this project has suddenly appeared out of nowhere, but this is simply not true. The subject of electronic voting and counting has been in the public domain for many years and it has been debated extensively in the Oireachtas. The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 specifically provided for the examination of manual ballot papers from the 1999 local elections for the purpose of research into electronic voting. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 provided for a statutory basis for the introduction of the new system. The matter has been the subject of many parliamentary questions. Voluminous design and test documentation have been made publicly available and a number of briefing sessions have been arranged for political parties.</P>

It reflects a broader process of modernisation and an expectation that democratic processes should keep pace with other progressive developments in society.

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Allen.</P>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for making time available to me. I never believed there was a strong case for the introduction of electronic voting. My philosophy is that if something is not broken, it does not need fixing.</P>
      <P>The old manual system of voting has served us well. If there was a downside, it was that in certain close contests counts and recounts could take a considerable length of time. The only people discommoded by that were the politicians. There was no indication that the public had a problem with long counts and every indication that they enjoyed them. The traditional system of voting was open, transparent and well understood by the people. It had a high level of visibility that voters found safe and reassuring. The voter marked the ballot paper and physically placed it in the ballot box. At the close of polls the voter could watch the ballot box being sealed and, at the count centre the next morning, being opened, the votes being sorted and distributed, the bundles being made, the spoiled votes being adjudicated upon, the counts being totted and the results being announced. All this was done in the presence of the media, the candidates and their representatives and in full view of the tallymen. My constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, must be getting old or tired. He has organised the all-party tally in Kildare for many years with great accuracy, and now he seeks to end it. What is the reason for that?</P>
      <P>There is no case for abandoning the old, reliable voting system. The mad rush to the exclusive use of an untried system of electronic voting was a misguided attempt to show off to our international neighbours. The attitude was that it <Col N="607"/>would impress the Yanks and the Brits. If they were determined to proceed with this project, there was an obligation on Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to get it right. Instead, the approach of the Government has been characterised by a shocking level of bumbling and incompetence. The partial climb-down represented by the amendment before the House confirms this.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's position on whether a ministerial order was required to permit the use of electronic voting in the European and local elections changed by the day and sometimes it changed within the same day. He now belatedly acknowledges that primary legislation will be required, something the Labour Party has pointed out over the past six weeks. We are told the new legislation will provide for the establishment of an independent panel to verify the secrecy and accuracy of arrangements for electronic voting. However, the panel will be appointed in advance of enactment of the legislation. Presumably, the independent panel will be appointed by the Government and presumably the process will be as independent as that which led to the contract for the promotional campaign for e-voting being awarded to people closely associated with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
      <P>Nowhere in the amendment is there an attempt to address the serious questions about the reliability and security of the electronic voting system we are preparing to use. These questions have been put forward by a range of independent computer and software experts. They are supporters of the wider use of computers and they have no axe to grind. It would be an act of folly to disregard what they say.</P>
      <P>There is an irrefutable case for deferring plans for the use of electronic voting in these elections. It would give time for a considered approach to this issue, with all potential problems being examined and dealt with. If we are to proceed to an electronic voting system, the minimum requirement is a voter verifiable system that will leave a paper trail which can subsequently be manually checked and counted. If every lotto machine in the country can do it, it can surely be accommodated in the proposed voting system too. If the Government presses ahead with the use of an electoral system in which the people have no confidence, it will do yet more damage to our democratic system. I will quote briefly from a letter we all received today from an electronics expert.</P>
      <P LI="1">Computers are excellent tools and fix many problems but they are prone to error because they are created and programmed by humans. Furthermore, the source code that makes computers tick can be frightfully complex and vulnerable to misuse without strict controls. I believe this issue to be a genuinely dangerous one for all politicians and their constituents. <Col N="608"/>Please tread very carefully if you don't want to be seen to be undermining our very democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a programme on RTE radio entitled &ldquo;What If&rdquo;. It brings together expert analysts to discuss what if different decisions had been made at key times in Irish history.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether in years to come a &ldquo;What If&rdquo; programme will be made about the extension of electronic voting to the local and European elections. The &ldquo;what if&rdquo; in that situation would ask what if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, had constructively engaged with the Committee on the Environment and Local Government which examined this issue last November and December. What if he had not effectively railroaded the committee into a decision endorsing his plans? What if he and his officials had engaged in an open, active and vigorous debate with Opposition parties and technical experts who have expressed reservations about their plans? If that engagement and dialogue had taken place, we might not be in the position we are in now.</P>
      <P>We have listened to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, for weeks telling us to trust him and that everything is in order. As late as last Monday night, we heard the Taoiseach say that he had seen no hard evidence that there was a problem with the system. Now, thanks to the combined efforts of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party and to the articulate external independent experts, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, who have taken this issue to the airwaves, we are slowly bringing the Government to a point where they realise that the Minister got it badly wrong last December.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 23 years and, in all that time, I have only once experienced the type of arrogance displayed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as he tries to introduce electronic voting. I suspect that if the Minister were in the country now, he would similarly have railroaded his Cabinet colleagues into a &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; policy. However, we did get a limited climbdown by the Government yesterday. However, that poses as many questions as it answers.</P>
      <P>The insincerity of the Government in announcing an independent panel at this stage is astounding. We are told that an <i>ad hoc</i> committee will be set up and that a statutorily based panel will follow at a later date. There should be no <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the running of elections. This exercise has exemplified the <i>ad hoc</i> approach and been full of indecision and Government bungling. It is hypocritical of the Government to continue to roll out electronic voting and to insist on having no voter-verified paper audit trail while at the same time the independent panel is supposed to deliberate over the integrity of the system.</P><Col N="609"/>
      <Miles com="cl" par="105"/><P>I do not claim to be an information technology expert but, since this issue has become topical, I have received many e-mails and phone calls from IT professionals expressing their concerns at the way in which the Government is proceeding. For example, one individual has told me that the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, in the United States will not allow the use of an Access database by firms seeking authorisation from it due to issues of verifiability and audit trail. However, the counting software being used in the Minister's system is based on Access. Why is Access not reliable enough for the FDA but good enough to count our votes?</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to resolve all these technical questions, but we need to have them resolved. The best way of doing that is to ask an independent electoral commission to do the necessary work. There is a precedent for establishing an electoral commission. India has one and there the commissioner has the status of a Supreme Court judge. Canada established one under its 1920 Dominion Elections Act and that commissioner has the same status.</P>
      <P>The Government's intransigence and arrogance has breached the trust between Government and voter. We are not Luddites. Fine Gael accepts the principle of electronic voting, but we insist on the best available system for casting and counting our votes. The Minister for Finance made a speech in this debate in which he used adjectives like &ldquo;insidious&rdquo;, &ldquo;unworthy&rdquo;, &ldquo;diabolical&rdquo; and &ldquo;appalling&rdquo;. These comments were over the top. They demonstrate the thin ice on which the Government is skating with regard to electronic voting.</P>
      <P>So far, the climbdown on electronic voting has all the hallmarks of delaying tactics by the Government until it is too late to use the paper based system. It is a cynical attempt to deflect from a flawed system. The introduction of an electronic voting system must be managed only by an independent statutorily based electoral commission and must include a verifiable paper audit trail. We must also ensure that the 41 questions posed at the Oireachtas committee on 18 December 2003 by computer experts are answered by the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the voting system is the bedrock of democracy and anything that diminishes or damages that confidence should be avoided. Serious concerns have been raised regarding the proposed electronic voting system and I do not understand the Taoiseach's statement, to which I referred earlier, which suggests that he is ignorant of the fact that a major report submitted to the Committee on the Environment and Local Government on 18 December contained 41 questions. Those questions were passed to the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who undertook to engage with the experts to answer the questions within the briefest interval. Two months later, the questions have not been answered.</P>
      <P>The critical all-party consensus that was promised with the introduction of legislation to cater for the change to electronic voting has been <Col N="610"/>cynically dumped in favour of ramming through a system that has fundamental question marks about its transparency and accountability and which has lost the faith of all the major political parties and, most importantly, the public.</P>
      <P>The condescending attitude manifesting itself in the advertising for electronic voting &mdash; pressing buttons &mdash; is doing damage to the credibility of the future introduction of electronic voting. The campaign has been marred by partisan leaflets and website demonstrations of voting options and will do little to aid public confidence in the concept of electronic voting, especially a system that is being presented to the public by a company over which there are major question marks concerning how it obtained the contract.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, asked questions about the awarding of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They were not answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I submitted a freedom of information request to the Department on the matter some time ago and I would like answers on how that contract was awarded.</P>
      <P>Electronic voting cannot proceed in June and the sooner the Government accepts this, the sooner it can spend the PR money on extra voter registration and turnout campaigns. The system is fundamentally flawed and for the Government to put democracy in the hands of a private firm should concern any democrat. What course can we take if something goes wrong? The only solution of which I can think is that the political leadership in this country would have to take responsibility. That means the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach must have the courage to admit that his Minister has made a mistake in proposing this system. This was followed by Cabinet's mistake of accepting the system without it having gone through an independent electoral commission. It is up to the Taoiseach to make the decision. Be it on his head alone if this system is introduced and fails to register the full democratic will of the people. The Taoiseach has long shirked responsibility. However, in this instance, the buck stops with him and him only.</P>
      <P>This matter is about public confidence and public trust. If the Government cannot see that it is losing the trust of the voting public on this, its members are even more remote in their Mercs than we feared. The present electronic voting system is not transparent enough to ensure the integrity of our democratic rights, and trying to get answers to questions on the proposed system is like pulling teeth.</P>
      <P>The Government must think its partial climb down has got it off the hook on which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has so painfully impaled it. However, I assure it that we will not let this issue rest. We will maintain our demands that these elections be suspended until an independent electoral commission has had an opportunity to review all the processes involved.</P>
      <P>We insist on an independent verifiable paper audit trail. We further insist that the source code issue be addressed. The Minister should make a <Col N="611"/>statement on whether trials and tests have yet been finalised on the software in regard to counting. It is ironic that vast amounts of public money have been spent on a system that has not <Col N="612"/>been proven. The taxpayer and the public in general are being taken for a ride.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter on behalf of the people of south Tipperary. In the past six weeks, two companies, Sram Corporation in Carrick-on-Suir and Continental Promotion in Tipperary town, shed 66 jobs and 21 jobs respectively, a devastating blow to both towns. I understand there are major difficulties in the current market, particularly the markets the companies were supplying.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o'clock</TimeSt><P>I implore the T&aacute;naiste to make Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town her number one priority in terms of finding replacement industries. If the Government is serious about taking action on behalf of south Tipperary, finding replacement industries will be the key. An advance factory is being built in Tipperary town and proposals have been made for an advance factory for Carrick-on-Suir. Both towns merit job replacement and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to do everything in her power in the coming months to convince IDA Ireland and all other relevant bodies that this is a priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the current difficulties in south Tipperary, the towns of Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary have long-standing high unemployment levels. As Deputy Hayes stated, we had two recent closures, Continental Promotion in Tipperary town and, more recently, Sram Corporation in Carrick-on-Suir. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to find replacement industries and to ensure the completion of advance factories in both towns.</P>
        <P>I ask that the T&aacute;naiste to examine urgently the possibility of extending decentralisation to Carrick-on-Suir, in particular. The town, which was overlooked in the Budget Statement on decentralisation, has a population of 5,000, of which 1,000 are on the live register. This unemployment level of approximately 20% is unheard of elsewhere in the country. The Minister for Finance has an opportunity to decentralise to the town some of the 1,300 jobs &mdash; 500 in the health sector and 835 in the information technology sector &mdash; which have not yet been allocated. I urge him to decentralise 300 of these jobs to Carrick-on-Suir, which needs an employment boost to create further jobs and <Col N="616"/>investment. Thankfully, Tipperary town was on the list of towns to benefit from decentralisation and I hope the 200 jobs due to transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will materialise quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment and apologise on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste who is unfortunately and unavoidably unable to attend the debate. I understand the Deputies' concerns and the T&aacute;naiste is conscious of the adverse effects on workers of recent job losses in south Tipperary, including 66 redundancies at Sram Corporation in Carrick-on-Suir and 21 job losses at Continental Promotion in Tipperary town. Unfortunately, lack of competitiveness was a key factor in the decision to downsize both plants.</P>
        <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S has contacted the companies concerned and is making available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement. guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs and courses.</P>
        <P>In continuing to improve the attractiveness of Tipperary as a location for inward investment, IDA Ireland is upgrading the Tipperary town business park which is expected to be completed in April 2004 and is in the process of constructing a BES advance technology building of 17,000 sq. ft. on the site, to be completed by June this year. IDA Ireland is actively marketing the new park and advance technology building through its network of overseas offices. In addition, the former Namco building in the town is being marketed by IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Tipperary town working group, a sub-committee of the South Tipperary County Development Board, was established following the announcement of redundancies at Pall Ireland in March 2003. The objective of the group was to bring together relevant stakeholders from the county development board to stimulate a number of local development initiatives, which would have the effect of promoting new community and enterprise developments in Tipperary town. The T&aacute;naiste understands that it is proposed to extend the remit of the group to include Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is an active participant in the group, with F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland. Tipperary Town Council, the South Tipperary Development Board, the county enterprise board and the <Col N="617"/>Tipperary Institute. The group is focusing on a number of employment and community proposals, including a development zone, incorporating Tipperary town and Limerick Junction; a logistics hub or theme park; a rejuvenation fund for existing community projects; and telecommunications enhancement.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has arranged for the South East Business Innovation Centre, Waterford, to conduct workshops and clinics during 2004 for existing tenants of the Tipperary town business and technology centre and any other interested small or medium size enterprises. The workshops will cover aspects of setting up business and developing existing business and the clinics will provide a one-to-one business counselling service for small businesses. The Tipperary enterprise and technology centre is now fully operational and ten micro-enterprises have set up there to date. The Carrick-on-Suir enterprise development group is currently in the process of delivering a high-quality training facility in the new community resource centre in the town. Support for the centre is being provided by the enterprise group, the Waterford Leader Partnership and the Barrow, Nore and Suir Leader Company.</P>
        <P>The setting up of the Blarney wool retail outlet at the old Tipperary Crystal premises is a positive development for the area with employment of over 30 people and plans for further expansion. The South Tipperary County Enterprise Board has also been very active in supporting the enterprise centre and other community initiatives and projects in Carrick-on-Suir. With respect to the Sram redundancies, the enterprise board has been in contact with management with a view to offering one-to-one, in-house clinics and a pre-enterprise training course for workers looking at self-employment as an option.</P>
        <P>The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 200 jobs to be relocated to Tipperary town. This move demonstrates the Government's commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>As regards the decentralisation of other jobs to Carrick-on-Suir and elsewhere, the T&aacute;naiste understands that her colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has already dealt with this matter in a written response to Deputy Healy today indicating that decisions have yet to be taken on this issue. The case for Carrick-on-Suir will of course be considered in this process.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste is satisfied that the combined efforts of the State development agencies under the aegis of her Department, in co-operation with south Tipperary development board and the county council and other local interests, should provide an adequate framework to deal with job losses and job creation in the area. I fully understand and appreciate the concerns of the Deputies and the trauma and concerns of the families concerned. I will ensure that the <Col N="618"/>Deputies' contributions will be brought to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter. The Ceann Comhairle has been in the House for a number of years and will know that this was a regular issue on the Adjournment in past years. We thought the question of incursions across the Border was now part of history and would not be repeated.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately on 11 February 2004, there was an incursion of British army personnel into the townland of Carnamocklagh on the Border and between Omeath village and Newry town. There are indications that PSNI personnel were establishing a checkpoint at some point along the flagstaff. The implications are obvious and serious. It is very undesirable to have people coming into an area on a winter's night where there are quite a number of elderly people. Army personnel prowling around in the dark give rise to very considerable unease among the families who are living there. It causes offence to the people and to the area and to people in the Republic generally. It serves as a reminder that the British army is present on the streets and across the Six Counties. Despite the significant progress being made in the political arena, it is a reminder to us that the British army is present and that there is some distance to go before we have the institutions and the political harmony in place in the North.</P>
        <P>I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs and its Ministers will avail of the first opportunity to have a one-to-one discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about this issue, to put their concerns on record and seek assurances that there will be no recurrence of this activity. Incursions can inflame passions in any area and I hope the Department appreciates the sensitivities that exist in Border areas.</P>
        <P>It is to be hoped that the political institutions in the North can be put back into a functioning state as quickly as possible. The result of the last election in the North has caused a stalemate. It is the earnest desire of all right-thinking political people to restore the functioning institutions as quickly as possible. We have come a long way in the last ten years and it is important that the momentum of that progress is maintained. I exhort the Minister and the Minister of State to avail of the first opportunity to discuss the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this important matter. The Government regards unauthorised incursions by both the British military and the Police Service of Northern Ireland into this jurisdiction as a serious matter. On each occasion on which the Department is notified of an incident, the matter is immediately <Col N="619"/><?oasys _fc?>raised with the British authorities and a report is sought from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The facts as I am informed as follows. At approximately 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 February, a large patrol consisting of officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, accompanied by members of the British army, allegedly made an unauthorised incursion into this jurisdiction in the area of Ferryhill, Omeath, County Louth. Details of this unauthorised incursion were brought to my attention on the morning of 12 February. My officials raised this matter with the relevant British authorities through the offices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast. Our serious concern regarding this incident was conveyed and an immediate and detailed explanation sought. Officials also asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to seek a report into the circumstances of this incident from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This preliminary report states that at 7.30 p.m. on 11 February 2004, a telephone call was received at Omeath Garda station. It was reported at this time that 15 to 20 British soldiers and PSNI officers were in this jurisdiction at Carnamocklagh, in Omeath, near Davey's public house, between Border crossing points Nos. 1 and 2. In addition to this telephone call, several local people also made similar reports detailing the incursion, some of whom have now made statements to that effect to local garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The Omeath Garda patrol car went to the scene but the soldiers and PSNI officers were not at that time present in the area. Reports have indicated that the soldiers and PSNI officers were all armed and had travelled between 400 and 800 metres south of the Border. In line with agreed procedures, this information was then conveyed to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast.</P>
        <P>The British authorities responded to our requests for information on this alleged incursion on the afternoon of 12 February. They confirmed that there was a joint British army/PSNI patrol in the Ferryhill area at around 7 p.m. on the date in question, but advised that at no time did they go within 700 metres of the Border. As eyewitness statements contradict this account of events, this response was deemed to be insufficient to address our concerns. Officials, therefore, made a further request to the British authorities for an explanation of the discrepancy between the two versions of events and for further details of those soldiers and PSNI officers involved. The British authorities have reiterated their response that no incursion took place at Omeath last Wednesday.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has confirmed to me today information obtained from the Garda to the effect that seven separate witnesses have made statements claiming the opposite to be the case. They allege that the group of soldiers and PSNI officers <Col N="620"/>entered the State at Border crossing point No. 1 and left again at Border crossing No. 2. These crossing points are approximately 550 metres apart. These witness statements appear to be quite detailed with regard to the exact position of the Northern security forces. Consequently, I have further raised the issue with the British authorities and in light of these witness statements have asked them to revisit the issue. Most reported cases involve a relatively small number of troops, police officers or military helicopters briefly crossing the border. They tend to be the result of navigational error on the part of security personnel new to Northern Ireland. The Omeath incident, therefore, was not typical as a relatively large number of soldiers and PSNI officers were in attendance.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of people living in Border areas about the entry into the State by the British security forces. As Deputy Kirk has pointed out, it is clear that these incidents are problematic and a cause of anxiety to locals living in Border areas. Some people see such incidents not as mere navigational errors, but as deliberate acts. If they are not thoroughly convincing, the subsequent explanations for such incidents are often viewed with distrust and scepticism, particularly by the local community.</P>
        <P>More broadly, progress continues towards full security normalisation throughout Northern Ireland, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and the Joint Declaration. The Government has repeatedly stressed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that all aspects of the Agreement, including the reduction in the numbers and role of the security forces deployed in Northern Ireland, need to be fully implemented. The number of security installations should be reduced to a level compatible with a normal and peaceful society.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration in an enabling context of acts of completion, the British Government agreed to the complete normalisation of security arrangements and the reduction, in effect, of British Army levels to those prevalent in 1969. Such a development would reduce the possibility of cross-Border incursions on the part of the British army. Over 40 military installations have been closed, vacated or demolished to date. Troops have been withdrawn from ten police stations and troop levels have been significantly reduced overall. Last week's announced closure of the barracks at Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, and the British army post at Clooney, County Derry, is another positive step towards this normalisation of security personnel and infrastructure. I am sure this development is welcomed, particularly by those living in Border areas.</P>
        <P>I will continue to remind the British authorities of the seriousness of incursions by British security forces into this State. My officials will seek to resolve the discrepancies between the official <Col N="621"/>British response and the statements given to the Garda. It is important that the facts are established to guide our responses and to ensure that every precaution is taken to prevent a recurrence of incursions. l assure Deputy Kirk of the unremitting attention of the Department in this matter.</P>

      <sTitle>Health Board Allowances.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. I have decided to raise this issue with the Minister of State because I have been approached by a significant number of my constituents who are encountering unnecessarily long delays in having their applications processed. Mobility allowance plays a vital role in enabling disabled people to live as normal a life as possible. In light of the inordinately high levels of unemployment among disabled people, which I highlighted in this House last week, this allowance is particularly important in allowing disabled people to live as normally as possible.</P>
        <P>A constituent who raised this matter with me has suffered from multiple sclerosis for 22 years, is housebound and cannot walk any distance. She applied to the North Eastern Health Board for mobility allowance in August 2002. After waiting over 12 months for the area medical officer to assess her medical eligibility, she finally received a brief letter from North Eastern Health Board, dated 9 September 2003, stating that she was not considered eligible. She had to wait for over a year to receive a simple letter of acknowledgement. No reason was given for the decision, but the letter stated that an appeal could be made to the appeals officer, a process she immediately commenced. Almost six months later, following frequent contact between the North Eastern Health Board, my constituent and my constituency office, the woman in question was told that she must wait for an unknown length of time for her appeal to be considered by the appeals committee and the area medical officer. The woman is housebound and under considerable emotional and financial stress.</P>
        <P>I have also encountered the case of an infant, under the care of a children's foundation in County Louth, who suffers from cerebral palsy and other distressing problems. The child, who is under five years of age, had to wait for a considerable period of time to be assessed. The child was refused mobility allowance, but a right to appeal was granted. The appeals body has indicated that it is so overwhelmed by its appeals waiting list that it will probably be 22 months before the child's case can be heard.</P>
        <P>Many people who apply for mobility allowance are turned down initially, but are then granted the allowance after going through a lengthy appeals process. People suffer extraordinary difficulties because they have to wait for a <Col N="622"/>considerable number of years. Many people who are clearly entitled to the allowance give up during the process because they become weary. It sometimes happens that they do not receive enough advice from State agencies, which should be much more user-friendly and helpful. Although the sums of money involved may not be significant for the health boards, they are extremely significant for the parties involved. A relatively small amount of money can be critical for those who are totally dependent on State pay-outs. Those to whom I refer do not have an opportunity to earn money in the black economy. They invariably have relatives who are financially burdened, having assisted them financially over many years. It is critically important that such people are dealt with quickly.</P>
        <P>How can the Department of Health and Children allow the problems I have outlined to continue to prevail? Is it just or reasonable that the most vulnerable people in society should be exposed in such a manner? Can the Minister of State stand over the lack of assistance to people who are clearly in need? Can he do anything to lessen the difficulties encountered by such people? It is clear from the cases I have mentioned that many difficulties exist. The people need be assured that problems such as those I have outlined will not continue. I hope the Minister of State will assure the House that all such applications will be processed in a timely manner in the future. This is a difficult matter, involving vulnerable people, and I hope something can be done to alleviate this serious problem. I am sure it does not exist in my constituency only, as I have no doubt that it prevails in other health board areas as well. I ask that the problem be examined at departmental level to try to alleviate it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Morgan for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to respond. He asked a straight question &mdash; is it just or reasonable that those he mentioned in his presentation are denied the allowance even though they qualify for it? It is not just or reasonable that people are refused their entitlements. I am pleased to remind the House that many of the schemes under discussion were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il administrations. Many of the measures introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, particularly while in office, have been designed to improve the quality of life of certain groups of people, such as those with restricted mobility. It would upset me to think that people who clearly qualify for this allowance drop out of the applications process in the manner outlined by the Deputy. The Government has not put in place a mobility allowance structure to facilitate such difficulties, but to ensure that those who qualify are able to access the allowance.</P><Col N="623"/>
        <P>I read with interest some comments expressed at a recent meeting of the North Eastern Health Board. I am sure Deputy Morgan would have contact with a number of the board members. I read with interest some of the comments made. One of them expressed the view that, with the abolition of the health board, a better service will be provided to the people in the region. As the Deputy is aware, structural changes are being made because of variances in the regions and gaps in the services. In the North Eastern Health Board, this may be one area that warrants address.</P>
        <P>Mobility allowance is payable by the health boards, subject to a means test, to persons with a severe disability. There are certain criteria to qualify for the allowance. The current maximum amount is &euro;142 per month. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case.</P>

	<P>Following a request from the Department of Health and Children, the national health board review group on the Department of Health and Children disability allowances-grant schemes was established by the health boards towards the end of 1999 to review allowances and grant schemes which come under the remit of the Department but are administered by the health boards. The mobility allowance was included in this review.</P>
        <P>The Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, is considering the review group's analyses and recommendations for changes in each of the schemes. The Department has, since 2000, increased the rate of mobility allowance from a maximum rate of &euro;57.90 to a current rate of &euro;142 per month. The Department recognises the benefits people gain from the allowance.</P>
        <P>With regard to the &ldquo;details supplied&rdquo; raised by the Deputy, responsibility for the provision of services is a matter for the relevant health board. From inquiries made by the Department to the North Eastern Health Board, I understand that there have been some delays in processing mobility allowance applications in Louth community services. Deputy Morgan referred to the processing period. I understand that, since 2003, the service pressures within Louth community services have eased with an increase in the number of area medical officers in Louth. Backlogs have been addressed in the past two months and there is now a reasonable waiting <Col N="624"/>time for medical assessments for mobility allowance. There is one case of mobility allowance being initially refused, and the appeal is due for consideration on Monday 23 February. If that is not a true reflection of the prevailing situation, the Deputy can bring further information to my attention.</P>

      <sTitle>Mental Health Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Approximately 436,000 people are over the age of 65 years, which represents 11.1% of the population, and 67.8% of these are female. It is projected that, within 30 years, this figure will double to 858,000 people or 18% of the population. While Ireland has the lowest percentage of older people within the EU, the life expectancy of older people is also the lowest in Europe. It is important to note that older people are not a homogeneous group. Their experiences and needs vary over cross-cutting determinants such as social, economic or cultural circumstances.</P>
        <P>A 1996 study, Mental Disorder in Older Irish People: Incidence, Prevalence and Treatment, estimated that 20% to 25% of people over 65 years have a mental health problem of some severity at any one time. While approximately 5% of older people suffer from some form of dementia, 15% to 20% experience other mental health problem such as depression and anxiety. Up to 13.1% of older people living in the community experience from some form of depression at any one time. Research has found higher levels of psychological distress in women than men and a definite age progression in distress levels. Similarly, a 2001 study of older people living at home recorded 20% of women reporting clinical or borderline scores for anxiety or depression compared with 15% of men.</P>
        <P>An increase in the level of suicide in older males has been observed in Ireland, as throughout the world. It has been advised that: &ldquo;The factors associated with suicide by older people include declining physical health, chronic pain, loss of independence, bereavement , alcohol and drug abuse and loneliness&rdquo;. A 1999 study, Income Deprivation and Well-Being among Older Irish, examined data from the 1997 Living In Ireland survey on income deprivation. It found that more than a quarter of older households fell under the 50% poverty line and more than half fell below the 60% line, figures described as extremely high and of great concern by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. Up to 10% were found to experience income poverty and basic deprivation which, according to the NCAOP, is unacceptably high and shows much needs to be achieved. It found that one in ten older persons were at risk of combined income poverty and basic deprivation. It noted a <Col N="625"/>high reliance of older people on social welfare pensions.</P>
        <P>There is an indubitable link between poverty and mental ill health. A 1999 study found that older people with incomes below the 60% relative poverty line had almost 1.5 times the risk of experiencing psychological distress, and those in basic deprivation had twice the risk of suffering psychological distress. The UN's international plan advises that mental disorders could often be prevented or modified by means that do not require placement of the affect in institutions. It also recommends:</P>
        <P LI="1">Health and health-allied services should be developed to the fullest extent possible in the community. These services should include a broad range of ambulatory services such as day-care centres, out-patient clinics, day hospitals, medical and nursing care and domestic services. Emergency services should also be available for the elderly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">For some older people admission to in-patient mental health facilities will be necessary. In 2001, there was a total of 3,274 admissions of persons aged 65 years and over to psychiatric facilities. Concern has been expressed for older long-stay in-patients, many of whom were admitted at a younger age and have grown old in institutions. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals observed in his report in 2002 that the majority &mdash; 55% &mdash; of patients in hospital at the end of 2002 were long-stay, being continuously hospitalised for more than one year, with more than one third of them hospitalised for more than five years, and the majority of long-stay patients being over 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>In a previous report he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Many, but not all, of these older persons now show little sign of behavioural disturbance related to psychiatric disorder and, among the more elderly of them in particular, their needs and disabilities relate to their age rather than to any psychiatric disorder. Their continued residence in long-stay psychiatric facilities is neither appropriate nor best suited to their needs. Their remaining on the psychiatric register is neither helpful clinically nor appropriate from a civil rights point of view. The inspectorate has been urging the transfer of their care either to community residences where that is possible or to suitable in-patient continuing care facilities for older persons or, when they remain in psychiatric structures, their de-designation from the psychiatric register to the provision of their medical care by general practitioners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P><Col N="626"/>
        <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for older people, I can assure him that this Government is fully committed to the development of services for the elderly, including psychiatry of later life services. The Deputy was quite right to say there are now more than 60 million people in the European Union aged 65 years or over. One in five of the population of the European Union is an older citizen and the ratio is set to rise to one in four quite rapidly. In Ireland, estimates suggest that by 2011 our population aged 65 years and over will have grown by 25%. Each year our over-65 population increases by approximately 6,000 and the number of people aged 80 and over goes up by 1,500. This will give rise to an increase in the number of older people suffering from mental illness and will present a major challenge to our mental health services in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Ceann Comhairle was responsible as Minister for Health for some of the pioneering and innovative work in the late 1980s which brought us a long way from the time when older psychiatric patients were locked up in gloomy old buildings. Planning for the Future integrated people into the community along the lines raised by the Deputy. Congratulations are due to the Ceann Comhairle and others involved in the work undertaken at that time.</P>
        <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has noted that 40% of in-patients in psychiatric units and hospitals are over 65 years old and, in some instances, particularly among long-stay patients, this figure exceeds 50%. According to the inspector, many of these show little sign of behavioural disturbance related to psychiatric disorder and, among the more elderly of them in particular, their needs and disabilities relate to their age rather than to any psychiatric disorder. The inspector has stressed the need to transfer their care either to community residences, where that is possible, or to suitable in-patient continuing care facilities for older persons. Health boards are pursuing this policy and significant progress has been made in providing care and treatment in more appropriate settings including, of course, continued provision of long-stay beds. Care in psychiatric units will also be required.</P>
        <P>Due to the increase in the number of people living to advanced old age, I am determined to ensure that specialised mental health services to meet their specific needs will be in place. The psychiatric needs of older people include specialist services for those with functional mental illness and services for those with dementia and associated behavioural problems, including Alzheimer's disease. Some of our services are sadly lacking in this regard. I am working very hard with several service providers to enhance, improve and in some instances, to put <Col N="627"/>in place services. I am doing my utmost to ensure that we provide adequate services.</P>
        <P>In 1996 the National Council for Ageing and Older People published the results of a study on mental disorder in older people in Ireland which was undertaken by the Health Research Board. The report focused on the mental health of older people and examined the treatments available to those with mental disorder. In line with the results of that study, psychiatric services for older people have been expanded in recent years and the integration of community and hospital-based psychiatric services with geriatric medicine is progressing.</P>
        <P>Deputy Neville has a particular interest in this area. Like me, he was a member of a health board and had the opportunity to visit several of these services. We all concur that in certain areas significant developments are under way particularly with regard to community services. Over &euro;7 million additional revenue funding has been committed since the publication of the report to provide for the establishment of specialist services for the elderly mentally ill in health boards where no such service had heretofore existed. There are now 21 consultant-<Col N="628"/>led teams around the country specialising in psychiatry of later life which is a great development. I have great regard for people working in this area and I work closely with several people in my own area such as Dr. Margo Wrigley and Dr. Mary Cosgrave and others who are doing wonderful work. It is important that we have the appropriate supports and structures in place to ensure that they, and the other consultants, continue this work.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including psychiatry of later life, is being considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy which was established last year. It is expected that the group will report in 2005. If I get that report any earlier I assure the Deputy I will want to roll it out to ensure that a comprehensive service is in place. As the population of older people in Ireland increases, we should not forget that our elders have been instrumental in building the Irish State to the prosperous level we enjoy today. This Government is fully committed to improving all aspects of their lives by focusing on issues that affect their well-being, including mental health.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to the export of live cattle to Libya is that an agreement was signed with Libya in June 2000 providing that Ireland would be officially listed as a supplier for Libyan live cattle tenders. Since then the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what was termed logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Tenders were subsequently issued for the supply of beef and Ireland was included on the list invited to tender.</P>
        <P>I will continue to avail of all diplomatic and other opportunities to ensure that the agreement with Libya concerning live cattle exports is fully implemented. This reflects our overall policy that Ireland should have full access to all markets for beef and cattle where there is demand. I am aware of calls for the reinstatement of export refunds in support of live cattle exports to Libya and I will raise this matter with the Commission once the market for live animals has re-opened.</P>

	<P>The dairy industry is an important sector of Irish agriculture with an annual turnover of <Col N="630"/>approximately &euro;2.5 billion. The future development of this sector is a priority for me. Both my Department and I have meetings with groups involved in the dairy industry on an ongoing basis and on a range of issues. My most recent meeting took place on 10 February when I met the representatives of the Irish Dairy Board.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of the Prospectus report in March 2003, I have met most of the larger dairy processing companies with a view to moving forward with the implementation of the key recommendations of the report. I also chaired a dairy forum in September 2003 which proved to be a very informative and useful meeting and which involved all the players in the dairy industry.</P>
        <P>I will continue to meet representatives of the industry during 2004 and I hope to provide whatever assistance I can to encourage the sector to make the necessary changes, both at production and processing level, to strengthen and improve its position in the highly competitive international dairy markets in which it operates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is carried out in full compliance with EU Directive 64/432. This has reduced the level of tuberculosis in cattle from 17% in 1955 to 0.3% in 2003. It is now accepted that the presence of an infected maintenance host, the badger, is a major constraint to the final eradication of tuberculosis from the national herd. A multi-disciplined research programme involving staff from the Department, Teagasc and the universities is making significant progress in identifying improvements to the eradication programme. This research is driven by science. Significant progress is also being made on the development of a vaccine strategy for the badger population. In this, my Department and others are in collaboration with scientific colleagues in the UK and New Zealand.</P>
        <P>The present policy is scientifically based and under constant review. For instance, this year changes include a more focused contiguous herd testing policy, more use of the ancillary gamma interferon blood test in target herds and a new enhanced computer system which will improve <Col N="631"/>our analytical capacity. The results of the four area study into the effect of local area badger removal will be published in the near future. This study is expected to confirm the results of the earlier east Offaly study, which indicated a significant effect on bovine tuberculosis levels following removal of badgers from an area. Under the PPF a new wildlife unit has been introduced to focus on the TB blackspot areas of the country. The removal of badgers is carried out by trained staff and badger welfare is a major element in the working of the programme.</P>
        <P>With reference to the Krebs experiment in the UK, detailed data relating to the trial have not been published by the UK authorities and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage. While the suspension of reactive culling of badgers has been noted, it is not possible to extrapolate the position to this country as the ecology of the badger is different here &mdash; for example, in the UK, 70% of setts are in woodland and 30% in pasture, while the reverse applies in Ireland and the social group size is different. The method of capture is also unlike that practised here in that the UK uses the caged trapping method whereas we use restraints for trapping. We did experiment with caged trapping but found no advantages from a welfare point of view.</P>

	<P>An additional 31% funding is being made available to forestry in the Estimates provision for 2004 and given the renewed interest in forestry as a viable and profitable land use, I believe the planting of at least 10,000 hectares will be achieved.</P>
        <P>There are applications for planting in respect of some 17,000 hectares in the system at present of which the majority have been processed and last week I announced increased funding for the support programmes in such areas as forest roads, reconstitution, native woodland and the neighbourwood scheme. In all, &euro;6 million will be spent on these schemes in 2004.</P>
        <P>I intend making every effort to encourage farmers and landowners to consider the forestry options this year and will be actively promoting planting through Coillte, Teagasc, the forest service and the various private sector bodies involved. A generous financial provision, including tax free payments and an effective support regime, is in place to enable the sector to achieve its full potential and to sustain a significant level of planting this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In the wake of the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system, the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcass and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control. In the latter regard, the foot and mouth disease crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed.</P>
        <P>Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now <Col N="633"/>firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have, however, made it clear consistently that I am always willing to enhance NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
        <P>A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union was agreed at the December Council of Ministers. The system provides that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period, all sheep are to be double tagged and identified individually, but all recording would be on a flock basis. The regime agreed by the December Council affords member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the interim period system, the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P>
        <P>I support the broad principle which underlies the agreed system. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject to practicalities and cost effectiveness, and I would be very anxious that Ireland and other member states would be in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim, however, the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance in regard to both identification and traceability which is strategically appropriate to this country.</P>
        <P>The package agreed by the December Council envisages the retention of systems such as NSIS, albeit with some minor adjustment, over the period leading up to EU-wide introduction of electronic, individual identification. I have no plans to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001, only to see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors, etc., being asked a few years from now to once again re-instate and accommodate individual identification and traceability. However, as I have earlier stated, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these be addressed within the EU system now agreed.</P>

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states.</P>
        <P>All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. The meat must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. The food and veterinary office, FVO, of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Imports of animal products from third countries can only be imported into the European Community through a border inspection post, BIP, which has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection on BIPs in each member state to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland, border inspection posts which are approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port, frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, chilled and ambient only.</P>
        <P>With regard to the discovery of avian influenza in certain countries of south east Asia, including Thailand, the EU response is being coordinated and operated by the EU Commission. In line with decisions of the European Commission, I introduced a number of measures specifically aimed at banning importation from that country of fresh poultry meat, meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing poultry meat, raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry obtained from birds slaughtered after 31 December 2003 as well as eggs for human consumption.</P>
        <P>The Commission subsequently extended this ban to cover the import of such products from China, including the territory of Hong Kong, as well as raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry, eggs for human consumption and non-treated game trophies from South Korea. A ban on the importation of live feathered birds as <Col N="635"/>well as unprocessed feathers from a number of countries in South East Asia has also been introduced. These controls must be kept in place until 15 August 2004. Before that date the FVO will review the operation of these measures and the evolution of the disease and will submit its report to the Commission and the standing committee on animal health and the food chain. At that time an assessment will be made as to the appropriate controls.</P>
        <P>Importers of meat must be registered with my Department. Importers must give advance notice of the arrival of meat to the BIP. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the personal importation into the EU of any meat, including poultry meat, or milk products by passengers from third countries is prohibited under Community and national law. Transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required under this legislation to bring this to the attention of passengers.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures dealing with imports, my Department is engaged in: collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, on updating the influenza pandemic preparedness plan; establishing further contacts between those involved in human and animal influenzas; the training of veterinary staff on avian influenza and emergency slaughter &mdash; this was already scheduled prior to the outbreaks in Asia; the preparation of posters and newspaper advertisements for travellers going to, and from Asia; and collaboration with the NDSC on advice for poultry workers in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. Leaflets have been sent out to all poultry flock owners which advise on biosecurity measures and clinical signs of avian influenza to look out for.</P>
        <P>In addition to these measures, the following measures are already in place: a contingency plan <Col N="636"/>in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza; guidelines for public health precautions to be taken during avian influenza investigations or controls; announcements on incoming flights and in the baggage reclaim area for people who have had contact with livestock, including meat or poultry, to make contact the Department's office in the arrivals hall; and ongoing surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds.</P>

        <P>To be an approved country it must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law and a residues programme approved by the European Commission must be in place. On this basis, Brazil has been approved for trade with the European Community in beef, sheep meat, horsemeat and poultry meat.</P>
        <P>The meat must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark.

        <P>Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on animal health and the food chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. In 2002, the presence of nitrofuran, a growth promoting substance, was detected in poultry meat imported from that country and this presented a potential risk for human health. The food and veterinary office, FVO, of the European Commission assessed the controls that were in place in that country and recommended that as a safeguard measure all imports into the EU be sampled and tested. Accordingly, in October 2002, following a decision of European Commission's standing committee on the food chain and animal health, I introduced the requirement for the sampling and testing of all direct imports into Ireland of poultry meat and poultry meat products from Brazil. Consignments may only be released when test results are clear.</P><Col N="638"/>
        <P>Following a recent mission to Brazil, the FVO has assessed that the action plan put in by the Brazilian authorities to address the deficiencies is being implemented and enforced. The results of the checks carried out by the member states on direct imports have also shown improvement. No poultry meat from Brazil has tested positive for nitrofurans at any BIP in the EU since August 2003. With regard to this country, nitrofurans have not been detected in any samples taken at the BIPs from direct imports. In the circumstances, the standing committee has recommended to the Commission that the level of testing for nitrofurans be reduced to 20%. When the Commission publishes its decision, I will amend the current level of controls that are applied in this country accordingly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no impasse stalling the start of the new REP scheme. On the contrary, the EU Commission's initial reactions have been both positive and helpful. My Department submitted proposals to the Commission early in December 2003. Those proposals had emerged from a comprehensive consultative process involving all stakeholders, and they also reflected the significantly increased payment rates agreed in Sustaining Progress. My Department met the Commission services in December and again on 20 January to progress the approval of the revised REPS scheme.</P>
        <P>In its initial comments on the proposals, the Commission has welcomed the way the scheme is evolving from being primarily concerned with conserving the existing environment, towards restoring and enhancing it. It advised, however, that for the present it would have difficulty in considering the proposal to extend eligibility for REPS to farmers applying an amount of livestock manure per hectare containing over 170 kg and up to 210 kg of organic nitrogen. It indicated that such a proposal would best be deferred pending a Commission decision on Ireland's action programme under the nitrates directive. As there are over 100,000 farmers already at or below the 170 kg threshold, the current qualifying limit for REPS, it was decided to resubmit the proposal without the reference to eligibility for farmers above that level.</P>
        <P>I remain convinced that it is best to extend the ambit of REPS to more intensive farmers and it is my intention to resubmit this element of the proposal once the Commission has given its decision on derogations from the nitrates action <Col N="639"/>programme for farmers above the 170 kg limit. The implementation of the nitrates directive is itself a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>A modified proposal for payment of the higher rates to existing REPS participants, under which they will incorporate elements of the new scheme into their existing undertakings, has also been included in the revised proposal forwarded to the Commission. While the Commission's formal procedures require a period of at least two months for examination of a proposal of this nature, I have written to Commissioner Fischler asking for his help in securing quick approval for the scheme and I am confident of a favourable outcome. As the Deputy is aware the payment rates under the new scheme are: 
up to 20ha, &euro;200/ha; 
20ha &mdash; 40ha, &euro;175/ha; 
40ha &mdash; 55ha, &euro;70/ha.</P>

In the context of discussions with the Commission, the Government is also committed to seeking approval for farmers to operate, in appropriate circumstances, at levels of up to 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum.</P>
        <P>It will not be possible to assess the full impact to the agricultural industry of the implementation of the nitrates directive until the European Commission has approved Ireland's proposals to give effect to the directive. The main impact of <Col N="640"/>the nitrates directive is likely to be in the area of waste storage capacity. My Department, in consultation with Teagasc, has made preliminary assessments of the quantity of additional waste storage capacity that may be needed to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. Teagasc has also carried out a comprehensive farm facilities survey in recent months. The survey was undertaken to establish baseline data on farm facilities and management practices relating to manure, dirty water and fodder systems. It will provide comprehensive and up to date statistics which will be used in drawing up detailed arrangements to give effect at farm level to the action programme when it is approved.</P>
        <P>Substantial financial aid will be available to farmers on whom the directive has an impact. In Sustaining Progress, the Government stated that &ldquo;recognising the importance of the nitrates directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources&rdquo;. These initiatives included a review of REPS with higher payment rates, and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme, in particular increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings.</P>
        <P>The improvements in the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme have already been delivered. Proposals for REPS, including an average 28% increase in payments, are now with the European Commission for approval.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1999 I established an advisory committee to advise on the role of women in agriculture and rural communities. Membership of the advisory committee was drawn from a wide variety of relevant governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. The advisory committee's report, published in September 2000, contained 36 recommendations in total, covering a very broad range of policy and operational areas. These areas were: statistical evaluation of women farmers; employment, training and information technology; representation; social inclusion, and personal finance-economic and legal issues.</P>
        <P>While recognising the contribution of women to Irish agriculture, it is clear from an analysis of the recommendations that the advisory committee's central concerns related to issues affecting women in rural communities more generally.</P>
        <P>Some of the recommendations of the advisory committee's report were overtaken by a range of developments, including the establishment of a national rural development forum. This meets in open session twice a year and provides a forum for continued attention to many of the issues raised in the report. It should also be noted that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaelteacht Affairs was established. In addition, elements of the report were incorporated into the national plan for women, published in 2002 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the change of remit of my Department and the aforementioned developments the advisory committee's recommendations have been pursued by my Department and a comprehensive progress report on the recommendations has been finalised. This provides ample evidence of the substantial progress made across the broad range of issues raised by the advisory committee. I have arranged for a copy of the progress report to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish livestock or beef exporters have unrestricted access to EU and world markets. In 2003, Ireland exported 221,000 animals of which 146,100 were exported to the EU and 36,922 to Lebanon. Currently the main markets for live cattle are Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal and Lebanon and I believe the trade is operating satisfactorily.</P>

        <P>The EU Commission decided in July 2000 to disallow forestry premia paid to Coillte Teoranta under Regulation 2080/92 on the basis that Coillte was a public entity and as such not entitled to premia.

The matter has been discussed in detail with the Government's legal advisors and the Department has been advised there is no recourse to further appeal and the decision has been accepted.</P>
        <P>The Commission's contribution to the disallowed premia has been repaid and no further premia are payable to Coillte. My Department has been in discussions recently with Coillte on the effect of the court's decision and these discussions are continuing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is considerable legislation already in place governing the labelling of food, which is mandatory. Food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area. It involves a number of Departments and Government agencies. The main piece of legislation for the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs is European Council Directive 2000/13/EC. The responsibility for this legislation rests with the Minister for Health and Children and he is also responsible for labelling legislation such as nutrition claims and novel foods. This legislation is enforced through the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for the policy on labelling of fish and fish products with the FSAI responsible for enforcement. Within my own area of responsibility, there is a number of pieces of legislation on the labelling of specific products ranging from beef, poultry and sugar to spirit drinks, coffee and fruit juices.</P>
        <P>Given the complexity involved and increasing consumer concern, I established a food labelling group to examine the whole area and since receiving its report in December 2002, I have assiduously implemented the recommendations of that group. The measures implemented included action on centralising enforcement of food labelling regulations in the Food Safety Authority, FSAI. This will not only streamline enforcement measures but provide a one stop shop for any complaints or mislabelling of food.</P>
        <P>In the past couple of weeks, I introduced two regulations in relation to the labelling of poultry meat. The first of these regulations require poultry meat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer. Heretofore, while these labelling indications have been compulsory for pre-packaged poultry meat, it had not been a requirement to provide this information for poultry meat sold loose.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above mentioned action, I have arranged that each sector will be reviewed on a commodity by commodity basis to identify any deficiencies, from a consumer viewpoint, in the labelling regulations for those commodities. Further action will be taken over the coming period in other commodity areas.</P>
        <P>In the beef sector, EU beef labelling regulations on origin do not currently apply to beef sold in the food service outlets. These regulations are currently being reviewed in Brussels. In the context of that review, I wrote to Commission Fischler asking him to consider <Col N="644"/>including a provision for the labelling of origin of meat in such outlets. It is expected that a report on the review will be issued in March.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 155 together.</P>
        <P>I have favoured the introduction of mechanical carcass grading in beef factories for some time and regard it as an important step for the beef industry towards securing its future as a high quality supplier of beef to EU consumer markets. I welcomed the inclusion of this policy in the Sustaining Progress agreement and pressed for some time at EU level to have mechanical grading provided for under EU legislation. Earlier this year, following EU sponsored trials conducted in an Irish slaughter plant, I was in a position to officially approve three machines for commercial use in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Detailed negotiations have taken place between the beef industry representatives and my Department and arising out of these, I have announced a scheme of grant assistance towards the purchase and installation costs of the equipment. A maximum grant rate of 40% of approved eligible expenditure, subject to a maximum of &euro;170,000, is available and the scheme is now open for applications. In order to avail of the grant, applicants are required to order the equipment on or before 19 March and installation must be completed by end April 2004.</P>
        <P>Mechanical grading is the preferred option of processors and farmers and the use of state of the art technology by the industry will not only enhance the producer processor supply chain but will also provide wider benefits to the industry in future years as Ireland consolidates its position as a supplier of top quality beef to the consumer markets of the EU. I am confident that grading machines will be in operation in a large number of factories in the coming months.</P>
        <P>As regards training of factory operatives, a total of 33 meat plant employees based at 16 slaughter plants have successfully completed the training programme provided by my Department. The availability of suitably trained classifiers within the industry is an essential feature of the operation of mechanical grading of carcasses. A limited extension of the training programme has been offered to the remaining plants as part of the final preparations being made for the commencement of mechanical grading.</P>

There have not been any developments in the meantime which would require any different decision. I indicated at that time that quota sold after 2004 would not include the value of the new decoupled dairy premium and this would have to be reflected in a substantial reduction in the price of quota at that time.</P>

	<P>The rules governing the production and use of GMOs within the European Community are set down in legislation which applies across all member states. This legislation has been jointly adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Given food safety and environmental concerns about the introduction of GMO produce into the Community, a series of legislative measures has been adopted over the last two years to ensure the highest level of protection for the citizens of the Community. This legislation covers the assessment and approval procedures for GM crops, food and feed, labelling and traceability.</P>
        <P>The legislation on labelling and traceability which will apply from mid April next will ensure that consumers can continue to exert choice in the food they buy and have full confidence in the food supply chain. With regard to the growing of GM crops, each member state has responsibility for drawing up its own procedures under EU guidelines to ensure co-existence between GM and conventional crops. I have established an interdepartmental-interagency working group to examine and come forward with recommended guidelines on strategies and best practices to ensure such co-existence.</P>
        <P>The Government has supported the general approach adopted by the EU Commission on GMOs. This position is compatible with the <Col N="647"/>official Irish position on GM technology which is one of being positive but precautionary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. The meat must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. exporting establishments must have: standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; traceability-labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.</P>
        <P>The food and veterinary office, FVO, of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Meat may only be imported into the European Community through a BIP that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of member states' BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland, border inspection posts which are approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port, frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, chilled and ambient only.</P>
        <P>Importers of meat must be registered with my Department. Importers must give advance notice of the arrival of meat to the BIP. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate <Col N="648"/>commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>With regard to the discovery of avian influenza in certain countries of south east Asia, including Thailand, the EU response is being coordinated and operated by the EU Commission. In line with decisions of the European Commission, I introduced a number of measures specifically aimed at banning importation from that country of fresh poultry meat, meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing poultry meat, raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry obtained from birds slaughtered after 31 December 2003 as well as eggs for human consumption.</P>
        <P>The Commission subsequently extended this ban to cover the import of such products from China, including the territory of Hong Kong, as well as raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry, eggs for human consumption and non-treated game trophies from South Korea. A ban on the importation of live birds as well as unprocessed feathers from a number of countries in south east Asia has also been introduced. These controls must be kept in place until 15 August 2004. I have introduced controls to comply with the EU measures.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the personal importation into the EU of any meat, including poultry meat, or milk products by passengers from third countries is prohibited under Community and national law. Transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required under this legislation to bring this to the attention of passengers.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures dealing with imports, my Department is engaged in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, on updating the influenza pandemic preparedness plan; establishing further contacts between those involved in human and animal influenzas; the training of veterinary staff on avian influenza and emergency slaughter &mdash; <Col N="649"/>this was already scheduled prior to the outbreaks in Asia; the preparation of posters and newspaper advertisements for travellers going to, and from, Asia; and collaboration with the NDSC on advice for poultry workers in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. Leaflets have been sent out to all poultry flock owners which advise on biosecurity measures and clinical signs of avian influenza to look out for.</P>
        <P>In addition to these measures, the following measures are already in place: a contingency plan in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza; guidelines for public health precautions to be taken during avian influenza investigations or controls; announcements on incoming flights and in the baggage reclaim area for people who have had contact with livestock, including meat or poultry, to contact the Department's office in the arrivals hall; and ongoing surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds.</P>

	<P>I had a very useful discussion with Mr. Ian Pearson MP, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, on animal health issues and the implementation of the 2003 reform agreement on the Common Agriculture Policy.</P>
        <P>On animal health, we reviewed the paper produced by both administrations reporting progress towards the development of co-ordinated animal health strategies for the island. We agreed that the ultimate objective of an all-island animal health strategy should be free movement of animals on the island subject to EU rules. We noted the main achievements to date including the development of complementary approaches towards preventing the introduction of animal disease, the convergence of policies on scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation on issues such as contingency planning, BSE and cross-Border fraud. We also noted the ongoing work on a wide range of issues, including animal identification and traceability, disease surveillance, animal welfare, the alignment of disease testing programmes and bio-security.</P>
        <P>We have agreed to establish a joint working group to consider cross-compliance issues arising from implementation of CAP reform given the desirability of taking a joint approach to this within the island.</P>

	<P>It will not be possible to assess the full cost to the agricultural industry of the implementation of the nitrates directive until the European Commission has approved Ireland's proposals to give effect to the directive. The implementation of the nitrates directive is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. A draft action programme, prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, was presented in December last to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. A period of eight weeks is being provided for stakeholders to submit in writing their comments on the document to either or both Departments. This phase of the consultation process runs until tomorrow 19 February. When the consultation process has been completed and consideration has been given to the various submissions, definitive proposals for an action programme will be submitted to the European Commission. In the context of discussions with the Commission, the Government is also committed to seeking approval for farmers to operate, in appropriate circumstances, at levels of up to 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The main impact of the nitrates directive is likely to be in the area of waste storage capacity. My Department, in consultation with Teagasc, has made preliminary assessments of the quantity of additional waste storage capacity that may be needed to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive. Teagasc has also carried out a comprehensive farm facilities survey in recent months. The survey was undertaken to establish baseline data on farm facilities and management practices relating to manure, dirty water and fodder systems. It will provide comprehensive and up to date statistics which will be used in drawing up detailed arrangements to give effect at farm level to the action programme when it is approved.</P>
        <P>Substantial financial aid will be available to farmers on whom the directive has an impact. In Sustaining Progress, the Government stated that &ldquo;recognising the importance of the nitrates directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources&rdquo;. These initiatives included a review of REPS with higher payment rates, and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme, in particular increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings.</P>
        <P>The improvements in the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme have already been delivered. Proposals for REPS, including an average 28% increase in payments, are now with the European Commission for approval.</P>

	<P>Grant aid towards investment in the organic sector is provided through the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was approved under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The scheme provides grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. Grant aid is payable at 40% of the eligible cost. The maximum grant payable over the duration of the scheme for on-farm investment is &euro;50,790 while the maximum for off-farm investment is &euro;508,000.</P>
        <P>Organic farmers are also eligible for financial support through the rural environment protection scheme, REPS. REPS includes a supplementary measure for organic farming whose objective is to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. Currently, an organic farmer with 40 hectares in REPS can receive up to &euro;13,280 a year, which includes payment of the basic measure, while a holding is in conversion to full organic status. When full organic status is obtained, such a farmer may receive an annual payment of up to &euro;9,680, which also includes payment of the basic measure. Organic farmers will also benefit, subject to European Commission approval, from the higher payment rates and higher eligible areas agreed in Sustaining Progress that have been included in the proposed changes to the REP scheme. Under these proposals, the maximum payment while a holding is in conversion will rise to &euro;18,505, and when full organic status is achieved the maximum payment will be &euro;13,555.</P>
        <P>In regard to training, the partnership expert working group, which advises the national organic steering group on the provision of training, education, research and advice, recommended the establishment of organic demonstration farms as a priority. I am pleased to say that as recently as last week, seven organic farms were approved on a pilot basis for this year to demonstrate a variety of organic farming methods. This initiative should provide valuable training and advice for both existing and potential organic farmers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the work to which the Deputy refers. For some time it has been clear that it is necessary for many producers in the dairy sector to scale up their operations in order to continue to operate profitably. This was identified in the report of the agri food 2010 committee and more recently in the Prospectus report. A reduction in the number of milk producers and the consequent scaling up of production by those remaining has been a feature of the sector in Ireland, in other EU member states and indeed in developed countries over several years.</P>
        <P>I hope that the decoupling of the dairy premium from 2005, which I announced late last year, will put producers in a better position to make decisions, based on their own particular situations, whether to continue in the industry or to exit from milk production and pursue alternative enterprises.</P>
        <P>As regards the future of the dairy sector, it is quite clear that further restructuring at production level will be a feature of the coming years for the dairy sector. The need for increased scale, at all levels within the dairy industry is necessary given our export dependence and the need to remain competitive on international markets.</P>

	<P>The fungus that causes the disease known as sudden oak death was first discovered in the UK in May 2002. The latest information on incidence in the UK is that nine trees at three sites in Cornwall have now been found to be infected. The trees affected are four holm-oaks, a turkey oak, two beech trees, one sweet chestnut and a horse chestnut. Another tree in Sussex, of a different American species of oak, has also been found to be infected. Some 300 other outbreaks have been detected in the UK, which have mostly been confined to rhododendrons in nurseries and garden centres.</P>
        <P>In Ireland the fungus has been found on rhododendron and viburnum shrub species at 31 garden centres-nurseries and on rhododendron at three locations in the wild. To date there have been no positive findings on oak or any other tree species.</P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>There is a number of control mechanisms in place to prevent the introduction and spread of sudden oak death in Ireland. Legislation provides for controls on the movement of rhododendron and viburnum within the EU, including from the UK, through the plant passport system; for import controls into the EU on susceptible plants and wood from areas of the USA where the disease is known to occur; and a provision for official surveys for the fungus to be carried out in all member states. I am increasing our levels of vigilance and surveillance and mechanisms are in place to isolate, manage and where possible eradicate any instances found in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I regard forestry as a major and increasingly valuable land use option in Ireland. With this in mind, I will be doing whatever is necessary to ensure a vibrant forest sector as part of Government and agriculture policy for future years. The financial allocation for forestry in the 2004 Estimates has been increased by some 30%.</P>
        <P>Since I announced the opening of applications in December there has been a heartening renewal of interest in planting for 2004. Applications for planting approval of over 17,000 hectares are at various stages of processing. I am confident that planting of at least 10,000 hectares can be achieved in 2004. Last week I announced the re-opening of the elements of the support programmes involving some &euro;6 million, including the allocations for forest roads, forest reconstitution, the native woodland and the neighbourwood schemes.</P>
        <P>I encourage all farmers and landowners seriously contemplating planting to recognise the financial and non-financial benefits that forestry offers and I state clearly that this Government's commitment to forestry is unequivocal and will be sustained.

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements <Col N="656"/>designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states.</P>
        <P>All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. The meat must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country the Commission, under safeguard measures, can suspend approval to export to the EU for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Meat may only be imported into the European Community through a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the food and veterinary office of the EU. In Ireland the BIPs that are approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port, frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, chilled and ambient only.</P>
        <P>Importers of meat must be registered with my Department give advance notice of the arrival of meat to the BIP. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>The personal importation into the EU of any meat, including poultry meat, or milk products by passengers coming from third countries is prohibited under Community and national law. The transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required under this legislation to bring the ban to the attention of passengers. Amnesty bins have been provided in the main airports for surrender of any animal product that has been inadvertently carried.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures dealing with imports, my Department is engaged in: collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, on updating the influenza pandemic preparedness plan; establishing further contacts between those involved in human and animal influenzas; the training of veterinary staff on avian influenza and emergency slaughter &mdash; <Col N="657"/>this was already scheduled prior to the outbreaks in Asia; the preparation of posters and newspaper advertisements for travellers going to and from Asia; and collaboration with the NDSC on advice for poultry workers in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza.</P>
        <P>Leaflets have been sent out to all poultry flock owners which advise on biosecurity measures and clinical signs of avian influenza to look out for. In addition to these measures, the following measures are already in place: a contingency plan in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza; guidelines for public health precautions to be taken during avian influenza investigations or controls; announcements on incoming flights and in the baggage reclaim area for people who have had contact with livestock, including meat or poultry, to make contact the Department's office in the arrivals hall; and ongoing surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds.</P>

	<P>From Ireland's point of view, an enlarged EU will create opportunities and be of benefit to the agri food sector. The European Single Market will increase by 106 million consumers. As a major exporter of agricultural products, the potential benefits, in trade and investment, of a market of 481 million people are significant.</P>
        <P>As in any open market there will be additional competition. However, the contraction of agricultural production over the last decade in certain of the new entrant states has in effect meant that they are net food importers and this will in all likelihood result in market opportunities for Irish companies. As the budgetary provisions for the Common Agriculture Policy are now in place until 2013, Irish and EU farmers are provided with a significant level of financial security.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area. My primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and indeed there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that <Col N="658"/>there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels.</P>
        <P>Following a request from the consumer liaison panel, I established the food labelling group in July 2002 to examine the whole food labelling issue. The group reported to me in December 2002 making a series of recommendations. I accepted the recommendations and set up an interdepartmental agency group to progress implementation.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made in the implementation of the recommendations. The two main issues that emanated from the recommendations of the labelling group were centralising enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin. It has been agreed that the enforcement of all of the food labelling regulations would be centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This will not only streamline the enforcement measures but it will also provide a one stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. At my request the consumer liaison panel has carried out this research, the results of which were presented to me in December 2003.</P>
        <P>I am determined, in so far as it is within the powers available to me, to meet the wishes of consumers, as identified in the research. I have recently introduced two regulations in relation to the labelling of poultry meat. The first of these regulations require poultrymeat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultrymeat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer. Heretofore, while these labelling indications have been compulsory for pre-packaged poultrymeat, it had not been a requirement to provide this information for poultrymeat sold loose.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above mentioned action, I have arranged that each sector will be reviewed on a commodity by commodity basis to identify any deficiencies, from a consumer viewpoint, in the labelling regulations for those commodities. Further action will be taken over the coming period in other commodity areas.</P>
        <P>In the beef sector, EU beef labelling regulations on origin do not currently apply to beef sold in the food service outlets. These regulations are currently being reviewed in Brussels. In the context of that review, I wrote to Commissioner Fischler asking him to consider including a provision for the labelling of origin of <Col N="659"/>meat in such outlets. It is expected that a report on the review will be issued in March.</P>
        <P>I will comment briefly on the progress in the implementation of the recommendations. EU directive on labelling of ingredients which might cause an allergic reaction was agreed at the Council of Ministers in September 2003, with the support of Ireland. Two new EU draft directives on nutrition and health claims for food are being discussed at working party level in the EU. Ireland is supporting these proposals. My officials are in discussion with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Food Safety Promotion Board to progress the incorporation of food safety-labelling-consumer issues in the primary and secondary school curricula. The group's recommendation in regard to informing the consumer of the price per weight unit was addressed in legislation brought in by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in March 2003. The labelling group emphasised the responsibility of the food sector to produce safe food and to provide on all food and drink labels information that is clear, accurate and easy to read. In July of last year, I helped launch a practical guide for industry on food and drink labelling which was produced by Food and Drink Industry Ireland.</P>

	<P>The total compensation available to Ireland under the dairy cow premium and national envelope is based on the level of the national milk quota in the year 1999-2000. Ireland's current quota includes an additional quantity of 150,000 tonnes negotiated under Agenda 2000 which has now been allocated on a priority basis. Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the dairy premium, the cumulative level of individual quotas needs to be adjusted to the level of the overall quota for 1999-2000. I am considering the most equitable way of achieving this, while taking account of the status of those producers who received allocations from the Agenda 2000 quota. I hope to make a decision in the matter in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>When I convened a meeting of <Col N="660"/>representatives of the main farming organisations and beef industry chief executives in December 2002, I did so against a backdrop of ongoing disputes between producers and processors which were damaging to the growth and development of the beef sector. The main purpose of the meeting was to enable an exchange of views on the issues that needed to be addressed to ensure that Irish beef achieves maximum export market penetration.</P>
        <P>A number of significant outcomes were agreed. These included the acceptance that margins would have to be available for all involved, both at production and processing level. It was further agreed that the future market strategy would involve Irish beef moving up the value chain within the EU and gaining a greater spread of markets generally. It was also agreed that every market open to Irish beef should be availed of, in particular Egypt. There was general agreement that quality of product must be encouraged and that the Department would drive the introduction of mechanical classification.</P>
        <P>Since then the beef trade has been performing extremely well. Last year the value of meat and livestock exports increased by 5% to just under &euro;2 billion, largely due to the strong performance by beef and live animal exports. Irish beef exports increased in value by over 7% to &euro;1.3 billion and the volume of beef exports increased by 9%. Almost 85% of exports went to countries in the EU, which compares to 50% in 2000. Exports to the UK showed further growth to reach 265,000 tonnes and was achieved despite a strengthening of the euro against sterling. One third of these exports went to multiple retailers, reflecting the higher value end of the market. The most significant development was the increase of 30% in the exports of beef to continental EU markets, reaching some 150,000 tonnes. As the EU remains a deficit beef producer, this market will provide continued growth opportunities for Irish beef exports.</P>
        <P>While the volume of trade with third country markets was marginally lower, at 85,000 tonnes last year, this was off-set by better returns from sales to UK and continental EU markets. Irish beef was exported to Egypt for the first time since 1999, assisted by the special export refund I secured from the Commission. The live trade has also improved considerably in the last year compared to 2002, with an increase of 48% in the number of animals exported.</P>
        <P>In the period since the meeting of the beef forum, cattle prices across all categories have improved considerably, with steer prices up by 9%, heifers by almost 4% and cows by one third. Huge progress has been made in regard to the introduction of mechanical grading. The legal basis for this has been put in place at EU and national level, machines have been put through the required trial and as of now three machines have been formally approved for use in Irish conditions. Last week I announced a scheme of <Col N="661"/>grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of classification machines and I am confident that the new systems will be in operation in a large number of factories in the coming months.</P>
        <P>As to the future, the market outlook for 2004 is very positive due to the combination of low EU production and strong consumer demand across the EU. The main growth is forecast in continental EU markets, notably France and Italy.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the issues identified and the actions promised have been delivered, although should the circumstance so warrant I would not hesitate to convene another meeting of the main players in the beef industry. I would add that meetings are held at regular intervals with the various representative groups on current issues. The sector is also represented on the agri vision 2015 group.</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, produces annual estimates of the value of farm inputs at aggregate level in the output, input and income in agriculture. According to the CSO's preliminary estimate for 2003 the value of farm inputs increased by 0.8% to &euro;3,148.7 million.</P>
        <P>The national farm survey produced by Teagasc is an in-depth survey which measures farm incomes across the main farming systems on an annual basis. In 2002 the latest year in which data is available 1,176 farms were surveyed representing 116,400 farms. The survey found that in 2002, overall direct costs, inputs, increased by 5% on all systems.</P>
        <P>In 2003, I commissioned an independent report from FAPRI-Ireland on the effects of the CAP mid-term review agreement and the Commission's WTO proposals on agriculture. The study examines three decoupling scenarios with FAPRI's baseline, no policy change, model for Irish agriculture in the period to 2012. FAPRI found that following the introduction of full decoupling in all member states there would be a reduction in input costs brought about by lower animal numbers and more extensive production.</P>

Routine inquiries on production are dealt with on a daily basis by the board.</P>
        <P>My Department promotes fruit and vegetable production through the EU funded producer organisation scheme and under the grant scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture under the national development plan. In 2003, there were 17 fruit and vegetable producer organisations in operation and they were in receipt of EU payments totalling &euro;3.78 million.

        <P>In general, Ireland is 70% self-sufficient in vegetables with this figure rising to 90% in season. While the market share of Irish vegetable production is declining and imports are increasing, this is due in part to the demand by consumers for more exotic products, which are not grown in Ireland for climatic and economic reasons. Overall consumption of vegetables is however increasing and the value of retail sales stands at &euro;322 million. Growth areas include prepared and organic produce and the food service sector is showing significant growth.</P>

	<P>Following the publication of European Council regulation at the end of September 2003 and having given careful consideration to the outcome of the public consultative process I initiated earlier, I decided in October 2003 that all direct payments for cattle, sheep and arable crops will be decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. I made my decision on full decoupling well ahead of the effective date of 1 January 2005 to enable farmers and the markets to adjust and to plan ahead with confidence.</P>
        <P>To ensure farmers were kept informed of developments, my Department published an explanatory guide to the mid-term review of CAP. In addition, a series of information meetings were arranged in conjunction with Teagasc to inform farmers of the outcome of negotiations following the Luxembourg agreement.</P>
        <P>While the European Commission detailed rules regulation has not yet been agreed, my Department has commenced the work of establishing entitlements for every individual farmer in the country. It will not be possible to finalise this work until such time as the Commission detailed rules are fully agreed which will be late spring of this year. It is envisaged that provisional entitlements will be notified to each <Col N="665"/>farmer later this year and definitive entitlements will be notified to each farmer with the area aid application in 2005.</P>
        <P>The European Council regulation provides that a farmer whose production was adversely affected during the reference period by a case of <i>force majeure </i>or exceptional circumstances occurring before or during the reference period, shall be entitled to request that the reference amount be calculated on the basis of the calendar year or years in the reference period not affected by the case of <i>force majeure </i>or exceptional circumstances. However, the farmer concerned must apply to be considered under <i>force majeure</i> and submit detailed documentary evidence to support his or her case. Application forms to claim <i>force majeure</i> were made available from my Department on 8 December last and I arranged for the closing date for receipt of completed applications to be extended from 23 January 2004 to 6 February 2004. Processing of those applications is now underway and farmers will be notified of the result of their application for <i>force majeure</i> as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Staff in my Department are continuing on a daily basis to answer any queries which farmers may have in regard to the decoupled payment system. Meetings are taking place on an ongoing basis with the farming bodies as issues arise. My Department and the EU Commission are meeting regularly where issues of concern to Ireland are being discussed. It is my intention to publish a new comprehensive guide to the single payment scheme when the Commission detailed rules are finally agreed and a copy of the guide will be issued to each farmer for his or her information.</P>

A draft action programme giving effect to the directive, which was prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, was presented in December last to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. A period of two months was provided for stakeholders to submit their comments on the document in writing to either or both Departments. This period runs until tomorrow, 19 February. When the consultation process has been completed and consideration has been given to the various submissions, definitive proposals for an action programme will be submitted to the European Commission.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority estimate that currently approximately 10% to 15% of farmers have safety statements. I am very concerned with the level of safety on our farms. The number of people killed or injured annually on farms remains unacceptably high. It is imperative that all farmers acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation and one that carries specific risks to themselves, their workers and their families. All necessary steps to minimise the risks must be taken, including the preparation of farm safety statements. I am totally supportive of the work of the Health and Safety Authority. All in all, my Department, in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority, is giving the issue of farm safety the highest priority and will continue to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The position with regard to the import of fresh meat and animal products from countries outside the European Community is as follows. Under EU harmonised rules, imports into the <Col N="668"/>European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries, which are approved by the European Commission's food and veterinary office, FVO. This office carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. The evaluation of third countries is on the following basis: there are systems in place for the rapid detection, reporting and confirmation of list A diseases of the Office International des Epizooties, OIE; there is access to laboratory facilities that allow detection and confirmation to take place; there are animal disease control systems in place whose operation and outcome must be recorded and demonstrable &mdash; for example, registration of holdings, animal identification and movement controls; there are operational contingency plans for the control of and/or the eradication of OIE list diseases; and that the import policy in the country, including its controls, as well as the animal health situation in neighbouring countries, have been assessed as acceptable.</P>
        <P>Where the FVO is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Animal products being imported into the European Community may only enter through a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland the border inspection posts approved for administering checks on direct imports of consignments of animal products from third countries are Dublin Port, frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, chilled and ambient only, and these posts are staffed by officials from my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition importers must be registered with my Department. They must give advance notice of the arrival of animal products. The products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation, which shows country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate which conforms to the models set down in EU legislation. The products must comply with packing, labelling and temperature control requirements. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purposes of safeguarding human <Col N="669"/>and animal health is carried out. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>There is a harmonised regime on protective measures against the introduction into and spread within the Community of organisms harmful to plants and plant products. This regime includes, depending on risk, such measures as prohibitions, certification, surveillance, treatment, inspection on entry and destruction of offending material. It also includes special measures where Ireland is recognised as having protected zone status within the community. The plant health regime is implemented strictly by my Department.</P>
        <P>Food of plant origin which is imported into the community from outside of the EU is subject to the same controls that apply to domestically produced produce. To date the monitoring programme in place dealing with pesticide residues does not indicate that there is any increased risk to the consumer associated with the consumption of food of plant origin imported into the EU from third countries.</P>
        <P>Marketing standards for fresh fruit and vegetables are laid down at EU level and checks on compliance take place on the internal market and at the point of import. Before release for free circulation products from third countries are checked for conformity with these standards and a certificate of conformity must issue in this regard. In certain cases these conformity checks may be carried out by the third country, provided that country has been approved by the EU Commission.</P>

	<P>In December 2003, I announced the main details of the 2004 milk quota restructuring scheme. This included the maximum price to be paid for quota, the allocation formula and the priority categories to apply in the year ahead. I am satisfied that the current model of restructuring has played a vital part in sustaining the viability of dairy farming throughout the country over the past 15 years, being a fair system both for those exiting and for those expanding. However, the introduction of a decoupled dairy premium payment in 2005 will obviously affect the operation of the restructuring scheme. In setting the price for the 2004 scheme, I indicated that the price level for the following year would have to reflect the fact that those selling into the scheme would retain the value of the premium payment. I have not yet decided on the arrangements for the 2005 scheme.</P>

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states.</P>
        <P>All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. To be an approved country, it must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law; and a residues programme approved by the European Commission must be in place.</P>
        <P>The meat must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; and traceability labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.</P>
        <P>The food and veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Meat may only be imported into the European Community through a BIP that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of member states' BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland, border inspection posts that are approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port, frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport, chilled and ambient only.</P>
        <P>Importers of meat must be registered with my Department. Importers must give advance notice of the arrival of meat to the BIP. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and <Col N="672"/>approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country, the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on animal health and the food chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. In 2002, the presence of nitrofuran, a growth promoting substance, had been detected in poultry meat imported from Brazil and this presented a potential risk for human health. Accordingly, in October 2002, following a decision of European Commission's standing committee on the food chain and animal health, I introduced the requirement for the sampling and testing of all direct imports into Ireland of poultry meat and poultry meat products from Brazil. Consignments may only be released when test results are clear.</P>
        <P>The FVO has assessed that the action plan put in by the Brazilian authorities to address the deficiencies is being implemented and enforced. The results of the checks carried out by the member states on direct imports have also shown improvement. No poultry meat from Brazil has tested positive for nitrofurans at any BIP in the EU since August 2003.</P>
        <P>With regard to the discovery of avian influenza in certain countries of south east Asia, including Thailand, the response is being co-ordinated and operated by the EU Commission. In line with decisions of the European Commission, I introduced a number of measures specifically aimed at banning importation from that country of fresh poultry meat, meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing poultry meat, raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry obtained from birds slaughtered after 31 December 2003 as well as eggs for human consumption.</P>
        <P>The Commission subsequently extended this ban to cover the import of such products from China, including the territory of Hong Kong, as well as raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry, eggs for human consumption and non-treated game trophies from South Korea. A ban on the importation of live birds as well as <Col N="673"/>unprocessed feathers from a number of countries in south east Asia has also been introduced. These controls must be kept in place until 15 August 2004. Before that date, the FVO will have reviewed the operation of these measures and the evolution of the disease and will submit its report. At that time an assessment will be made as to the appropriate controls to be applied.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the personal importation into the EU of any meat, including poultry meat, or milk products by passengers from third countries is prohibited under Community and national law. The transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required under this legislation to bring this ban to the attention of passengers.</P>

	<P>In 2002, the presence of nitrofuran, a growth promoting substance, was detected in poultry meat imported from Brazil and this presented a potential risk for human health. The food and veterinary office, FVO, of the European Commission assessed the controls that were in place in that country and, taking into account assurances given by the competent authorities to strengthening these controls, recommended that as a safeguard measure all imports into the EU be sampled and tested. The position was to be reviewed in the light of the operation of these guarantees and on the results of testing of direct imports. Accordingly, in October 2002, I introduced the requirement for the sampling and testing of all direct imports into Ireland of poultry meat and poultry meat products from Brazil. Consignments may only be released when test results are clear.</P>
        <P>The FVO has assessed that the action plan put in by the Brazilian authorities to address the deficiencies is being implemented and enforced. The results of the checks carried out by the member states on direct imports have also shown improvement. No poultry meat from Brazil has tested positive for nitrofurans at any BIP in the EU since August 2003. With regard to this country nitrofurans have not been detected in any samples taken from direct imports. In the circumstances, the standing committee has recommended to the Commission that the level of testing for nitrofurans be reduced to 20%. When the Commission publishes its decision, I will amend the current level of controls applied in this country accordingly.</P>
        <P>The position in regard to exports from third countries is that detailed EU legislation in the <Col N="674"/>veterinary field lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states.</P>
        <P>Under that harmonised legislation, all products of animal origin imported into the EU must come from approved countries, approved establishments in those countries, travel with a health certificate and commercial document, be appropriately labelled and be presented for a veterinary check at an EU approved border inspection post.</P>
        <P>With regard to the discovery of avian influenza in certain countries of south east Asia, including Thailand, the EU response is being co-ordinated and operated by the EU Commission. In line with decisions of the European Commission, I introduced a number of measures specifically aimed at banning importation from that country of fresh poultry meat, meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing poultry meat, raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry obtained from birds slaughtered after 31 December 2003 as well as eggs for human consumption. The decision does not apply to poultry meat products that have been heat treated.</P>
        <P>The Commission subsequently extended this ban to cover the import of such products from China, including the territory of Hong Kong, as well as raw materials for pet food containing any part of poultry, eggs for human consumption and non-treated game trophies from South Korea. A ban on the importation of live birds and as well as unprocessed feathers from a number of countries in south east Asia has also been introduced. These controls must be kept in place until 15 August 2004. Before that date, the FVO will review the operation of these measures and the evolution of the disease and will submit its report to the Commission and the standing committee on animal health and the food chain. At that time an assessment will be made as to the appropriate controls that must be applied.</P>
        <P>As can be seen from the above, the EU Commission is closely monitoring the avian influenza situation and is taking the necessary action. In the circumstances, there is no need to introduce tighter controls on imports from other third countries.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, discussed the matter of avian influenza and issues regarding mutual co-operation in Europe to combat this disease with the European Health Ministers in Brussels on 12 February. Ministers also agreed on the need for the provision of balanced information to the public and press to avoid undue alarm while maintaining a strong position of alertness. It was also agreed that Health Ministers across Europe would <Col N="675"/>continue to co-ordinate their responses to this public health challenge.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures dealing with imports, my Department is engaged in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, on updating the influenza pandemic preparedness plan; establishing further contacts between those involved in human and animal influenzas; the training of veterinary staff on avian influenza and emergency slaughter, this was already scheduled prior to the outbreaks in Asia; the preparation of posters and newspaper advertisements for travellers going to and from Asia; and collaboration with the NDSC on advice for poultry workers in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. Leaflets have been sent out to all poultry flock owners which advise on biosecurity measures and clinical signs of avian influenza to look out for.</P>
        <P>In addition to these measures, the following measures are already in place: a contingency plan in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza; guidelines for public health precautions to be taken during avian influenza investigations or controls; announcements on incoming flights and in the baggage reclaim area for people who have had contact with livestock, including meat or poultry; and ongoing surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds.</P>
        <P>I have recently introduced two statutory instruments concerning the labelling of poultry meat. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, that is, non pre-packaged, to be provided to the consumer. Heretofore, while labelling indications have been compulsory for pre-packaged poultry meat, it had not been a requirement to provide this information for loose poultry meat.</P>

	<P>I have always been aware of the need for long-term planning in the sector. In 2003, the fourth Department statement of strategy was published. The statement of strategy describes the environment, both internal and external, within which the Department operates and identifies the challenges ahead. It states our mission for the three years ahead, identifies the goals and strategies of the Department on a long-term basis and describes the evaluation and monitoring process culminating in an annual report. At a practical level, it forms the basis of all the divisional business plans of the Department that identify the specific actions that will be undertaken to implement the strategies contained in the document to develop and support the sector.</P>
        <P>To further enhance the planning process, I formed the agri food 2010 committee in 1999 to advise me on the best long-term approach to be taken in the sector. That group presented what I believe was a detailed and coherent plan. In response to that committee's report my Department drew up an extensive plan of action. The vast majority of the recommendations from this plan of action have been implemented.</P>
        <P>It is with a view to continuing the planning process for the long-term future of the agri food sector, with the changing internal and external environments, that I have established a new group to set out a vision for the agriculture and food sector over the coming decade. This new group referred to as the agri vision 2015 committee and has been asked to review the recommendations of the agri food 2010 report in the context of developments since the report was completed. This new group is broadly based and possesses a wide range of skills and experience. It is drawn from farming, the food industry, research, academia and the State agencies with a direct interest in the agriculture and food industries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The continuing presence of avian influenza in Asia is being monitored closely by the European Commission and also by my Department. With the rapidly changing situation in Asia the European Commission is constantly reviewing safeguard measures as adopted in Commission decisions 2004/84/EC and 2004/93/EC.</P>
        <P>On 3 February 2004, the standing committee on the food chain and animal health voted to adopt Commission decision 2004/122/EC, which places a ban on the importation from Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, including the territory of Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam of: all live birds, including birds accompanying their owners, that is, pet birds; fresh meat of poultry, ratites, wild and farmed feathered game; meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing, meat of those species mentioned above; raw material for pet food production; eggs for human consumption; and unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers.</P>
        <P>The only products that are allowed to be imported are poultry meat and game-meat meat products from Thailand slaughtered before 1 January 2004; and poultry meat and game-meat meat products from Thailand that have undergone a heat treatment process. I emphasise that prior to the outbreak of avian influenza in Asia, the only imports of poultry related products from the countries affected were poultry meat from Thailand and processed feathers from the People's Republic of China. The scientific evidence available to date suggests that close contact with live infected birds constitutes by far the greatest risk of transmission of the avian influenza virus to humans. None of the countries currently affected with avian influenza are authorised by the European Commission to export live poultry to the European Union.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures being implemented at European level, at national level my Department is engaged in collaboration with the Department of Health and Children and the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, on updating the influenza pandemic preparedness plan; establishing further contacts between those involved in combating human and animal influenzas; the training of veterinary staff on avian influenza aspects and emergency slaughter; the preparation of posters and newspaper <Col N="678"/>advertisements for travellers going to, and from Asia; and collaboration with the NDSC on advice for poultry workers in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. Leaflets have been sent out to all poultry flock owners which provide advice on biosecurity measures and clinical signs of avian influenza.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the following measures are already in place: a contingency plan in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza; guidelines on public health precautions to be taken during avian influenza investigations or controls; announcements on incoming flights and in the baggage reclaim area for people who have had contact with livestock including poultry to contact the Department's office in the arrivals hall; an existing ban on the importation from third countries of meat and meat products in personal baggage, other than proprietary brand infant food or special food for medical reasons which does not require refrigeration and is in packaging that is unbroken; and ongoing surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds</P>
        <P>Implementation of the measures mentioned above, along with the combined efforts and resources of the international community significantly reduce the threat of avian influenza spreading further afield.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The milk quota system has, over the years since its introduction, been largely beneficial to the industry in Ireland and the EU. It has reduced the huge surpluses which overhung the market, has restored stability and helped to keep prices at a reasonable level in the sector over the years. On that basis, its extension to 2014-15 in the mid-term reform agreement was a positive outcome and was welcomed by the industry generally. It is clear from studies undertaken that the abolition of the regime would have resulted in a major reduction in milk prices to a level where the majority of producers would have found it impossible to operate profitably.</P>
        <P>The EU quota system allows considerable flexibility to member states as to the manner in which it is applied at national level. Ireland has operated the system in such a way as to favour smaller committed producers and to use whatever flexibility is available to ensure such producers can increase their scale and position themselves to better withstand competitive pressures. It is my intention to continue to apply the quota system in an equitable way and in the best interests of the Irish dairy sector as a whole.</P>

        <P>The PIAB will be based in a single office in the greater Dublin area.

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>A draft action programme giving effect to the directive, which was prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and in consultation with Teagasc, was presented in December last to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. A period of two months was provided for stakeholders to submit their comments on the document in writing to either or both Departments. This period runs until tomorrow, 19 February. When the consultation process has been completed and consideration has been given to the various submissions, definitive proposals for an action programme will be submitted to the European Commission. Clearly, it is important that the action programme satisfies the EU Commission as regards compliance while at the same time allowing maximum flexibility for individual farmers.</P>
        <P>The Sustaining Progress agreement stated that in the context of the regime soon to be adopted to transpose the provisions of the nitrates directive, the Government will use the flexibility in the directive to seek to secure European Commission approval for limits of up to 250 kg per hectare per annum to be allowable in appropriate circumstances. The draft action programme currently under discussion includes a provision to this effect and is therefore consistent with the provisions of Sustaining Progress.</P>

	<P>The farm waste management scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is implemented in accordance with an approved programme of on-farm investment schemes under Council Regulation 1257/1999. The scheme provides that applicants will be accepted from farmers who have a minimum of 30 income units, of which at least 20 must come from farming. As off-farm income can therefore be taken into account in order to meet this minimum income threshold of 30 income units, the number of farmers that currently fall into this category is difficult to determine.</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's question no 242 of 3 February 2004, a compliance check was carried out on the farm of the person named on 30 July 2003 in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation No. (EC) 3508/92 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1593/2000. This compliance check revealed that the herd owner had claimed forage area in 2002 in respect of 6.02 hectares of forestry for which he was not eligible to claim area aid as he was already in receipt of the afforestation premium for this land.</P>
        <P>The area aid of the person named for 2002 has had to be revised to exclude this land and to apply the appropriate area aid penalty of double the difference between the area found and the claimed area. The net effect of the revision has been that a forage area of 25.09 hectares has been determined for payment purposes for 2002. This has resulted in an overpayment of &euro;129.05 for 2002. My Department will be in further contact with the person named concerning the recovery of this amount.</P>
        <P>I should point out that the area of 37.44 hectares in 2002 to which the Deputy refers is an incorrect forage area as it includes forestry area planted by the person named. A further downward revision was therefore required to reflect the true position.</P>
        <P>I should point out that in 2003, the person named reduced the area pre-printed on his 2003 area aid application from 37.44 hectares to 34.91 hectares to reflect this position. Furthermore, as this land parcel was afforested in 1998, my Department is examining area aid applications submitted by the person named in the years prior to 2002 and will be in contact with the person named in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my policy and that of the Government that Irish beef and lamb should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities.</P>
        <P>Beef exports have been doing particularly well in recent years involving a very considerable growth in trade to other EU countries. Last year exports to the UK amounted to some 265,000 tonnes which is up 20,000 tonnes on 2002 and up 155,000 tonnes on 2000. Markets for Irish beef in France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Sweden also remain strong.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-EU markets, in the course of the past year Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have lifted their BSE related restrictions on Irish beef imports. I am keen to have existing restrictions, where they remain, removed at the earliest possible date. In September 2003, following ongoing contact with the authorities there, Egypt which had re-opened its market to Irish beef in October 2001 further eased the conditions of supply which led to the resumption of trade in November 2003.</P>
        <P>In July 2003, Bahrain lifted its restrictions on Irish beef imports. Following contacts with the Saudi authorities late last year, a Saudi veterinary delegation will visit Ireland in March and I am optimistic that visit will represent a significant move towards the lifting of the Saudi ban on Irish beef. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, continues to make intensive efforts to have other important markets such as Iran, South Africa and the Philippines reopened.</P>
        <P>Irish sheep meat exports in 2004 are expected to reach some 43,000 tonnes, slightly less than 2003, reflecting lower supply patterns and improved levels of demand on the home market, which increased by 8% last year. The most important export market is France where sales are expected to reach 31,000 tonnes in 2004. Bord Bia continues to work with the lamb exporting industry to expand our position in this and other markets and to ensure maximum returns from our exports. As the EU is a net importer of lamb, the question of exports to non-EU destinations does not arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The outlook for cereal growing in Ireland is quite positive and Irish cereal producers are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges ahead. Under the reformed CAP, Irish cereal farmers will have the cushion of the single farm payment decoupled from production, and will be able to concentrate on supplying markets, focusing on minimising production costs and maximising their incomes. Improved efficiency of production at farm level will be important to maintain incomes, and to ensure that the volume of output is maintained to support the processing sector. Average grain production in the country over the past number of years has been in the region of two million tonnes and the aim is to maintain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported grain.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties, etc. In addition, Teagasc provides comprehensive research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.</P>
        <P>In the CAP reform negotiations, which culminated in the Luxembourg Agreement last June, Ireland's objectives for the cereals sector were generally achieved. The proposed reduction of 5% in the pre-Agenda 2000 intervention price for arable crops was withdrawn, and the original proposal for ten-year obligatory non-rotational set-aside, which would not have been suitable in the Irish situation, was also dropped. The decision to leave the basic intervention price unchanged will help protect the sector from cheap imports, as the cereals import price is related to the intervention price. A study by FAPRI of the effects of both the Luxembourg Agreement and the proposals submitted by the EU Commission to the WTO concluded that the impact on the cereals sector would not be significant.</P><Col N="690"/>
        <P>EU arable aid payments, which amounted to &euro;129 million last year, constitute an important part of cereal producers' incomes. My Department continually strives to ensure that these payments are issued promptly, and we have now reached the stage where over 90% of these payments are issued within one week of the commencement date for payment laid down in EU Regulations.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU is now a net importer of beef. Consumption levels now exceed pre BSE levels and are forecast to rise further. Production levels on the other hand are in decline. The EU beef market is moving into a period of continuing deficit and is estimated to have an import requirement of 400,000 tonnes in 2004.</P>
        <P>Irish beef returned a strong performance last year in European markets while the volumes being exported to Third Country markets were helped by a good recovery in trade to Russia. The United Kingdom remained the principal market for Irish beef, accounting for over half total exports at 265,000 tonnes. Exports of beef to Continental EU markets increased by 30 per cent during 2003 to an estimated 150,000 tonnes or 30 per cent of total exports.</P>
        <P>The introduction, at my request, by the EU of a special export refund facilitated the re-opening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef. I also made considerable efforts throughout 2002 and 2003 to secure the re-opening of other third country markets, in particular the Gulf States, South Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines, all of which had imposed an import ban on beef from the EU. My Department and Bord Bia hosted veterinary and food safety experts from the Gulf States including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the UAE in relation to the safety of Irish beef. Follow-up action to re-open these markets continues.</P>
        <P>I believe there is a strong determination within the beef sector to meet the challenges under the new regime arising from the Luxembourg agreement. Irish beef faces strong competition from South America in particular, to retain and expand market opportunities. In this regard the industry needs to intensify its focus on both quality and price in order to improve its international competitiveness and sharpen its appeal to consumers. The increase in our exports in 2003 to the high value EU Continental markets is indicative of our success in this area.</P>

	<P>The future development of the dairy sector is a priority for me. I will provide assistance to encourage the sector to make the necessary changes, both at producer and processor level, to strengthen and improve its position in the increasingly competitive international markets.</P>
        <P>The EU milk quota regime was extended until 2014 or 2015 under the mid-term review and a volume growth in milk output is restricted. However, there is considerable potential for increasing the value of our national milk output. There is potential to improve the composition of raw milk at farm level by increasing the protein levels and to add further value to the product at processing and marketing level. The changed EU market supports, coupled with the extension of the milk quota regime, will require Irish dairy processing companies to look at alternative opportunities to develop and enhance their position on the international markets.</P>
        <P>The movement towards higher value added products and the need for greater expenditure on research and development was one of the key recommendations of the prospectus report launched last March. It also recommended a need for increased scale and greater cost efficiency throughout the sector.</P>
        <P>The dairy sector has great potential to grow and develop notwithstanding the increasingly competitive international environment. In order to realise the potential, the industry must have regard to the best international practice in all respects from the farm right through to the final customer and must address those issues identified as being essential to the maintenance of international competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The industry is facing an increasingly competitive and challenging external environment. An effective marketing strategy to promote Irish agri food produce is an essential prerequisite to future export growth. While primary responsibility for marketing Irish produce rests with the food industry, Bord Bia plays a leading role in developing export markets. Bord Bia devised a range of specialist marketing and promotion activities under the brand name <Col N="692"/>&ldquo;Ireland the Food Island&rdquo; to enhance our international reputation as a producer of quality food produce. Significant progress continues to be made in overseas markets with exports of food and drink products increasing to &euro;7 billion in 2003.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia works closely with producers, processors and customers to develop new and repeat business opportunities in target markets. Its strategy for development of market potential in the new member states is to increase awareness of Irish food and drink products, particularly beef, dairy and beverages, at trade level. The focus is on developing trade in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland as these markets are regarded as having most potential for Irish meat and dairy products.</P>
        <P>In the prepared consumer food sector, Bord Bia will host a major trade exhibition in Dublin later this year. It will target new customers from the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. Bord Bia will conduct trade missions with Irish beverage companies to exploit emerging markets in the Baltic states and the gulf region. Initiatives in the pig meat sector will focus on building profitable and sustainable market niches in the UK, continental Europe and international markets.</P>
        <P>It is my view that the amalgamation of Bord Bia and Bord Glas will lead to a more cohesive approach to the delivery of services by State agencies in the food sector. The combined expertise of an amalgamated body will bring together the synergy necessary to promote the food and horticultural industry.</P>
        <P>I have also established the agri vision 2015 committee to identify the issues and opportunities confronting the agri food industry up to 2015. The group consists of industry experts and will set out the vision and strategies needed to develop this key economic sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 to 189, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Detailed EU legislation in the veterinary field lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the imports of products of animal origin from third countries. This harmonised legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states.</P>
        <P>All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. Meat and animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark.</P>
        <P>Meat may only be imported into the European Community through a border inspection post that has been approved by the food and veterinary office. The office also carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure that the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland BIPs that are approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port for frozen, chilled and ambient temperature animal products, and Shannon Airport for chilled and ambient only.</P>
        <P>Meat importers must be registered with my Department. They must give advance notice of the arrival of meat to the BIP. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>In 2003 a total of 32 consignments were rejected for the following reasons: 26 were rejected for incomplete documentation, of which 25 were destroyed and one was redispatched; two consignments were rejected and destroyed as they were presented at a point of entry that was not an approved BIP; four consignments were rejected because they had no health certificate of <Col N="694"/>which three were destroyed and one was redispatched.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to assess the full cost to the agricultural industry of the implementation of the nitrates directive until the European Commission has approved Ireland's proposals to give it effect. Its implementation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Both Departments prepared a draft action programme in consultation with Teagasc. Last December it was presented to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders. They had eight weeks to submit written comments on it to either or both Departments. This phase of the consultation process runs until tomorrow. After the submissions have been considered definitive proposals for an action programme will be submitted to the European Commission. In the context of discussions with the Commission, the Government is also committed to seeking approval for farmers to operate, in appropriate circumstances, at levels of up to 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum.</P>
        <P>The main impact of the nitrates directive is likely to be in the area of waste storage capacity. Substantial financial aid will be available to farmers on whom the directive has an impact. In Sustaining Progress the Government stated that &ldquo;Recognising the importance of the nitrates directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>They included a review of REPS with higher payment rates, and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme, in particular increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings. The improvements in the last two schemes mentioned have already been delivered. Proposals for REPS, including an average 28% increase in payments, are now with the European Commission for approval.</P>

        <P>The scheme was administered on a confidential basis by the Irish Red Cross Society on behalf of the OPW. The closing date for applications was 26 November 2003. However, a number of late applications were received by the IRCS and have been dealt with appropriately.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department examined the report and its conclusions on the inspections carried out by UN weapons inspectors into the weapons of mass destruction held by the former Iraqi regime led by Saddam Hussein. It drew a number of useful conclusions.</P>
        <P>The report does not fully reflect statements made by Dr. Blix, the head of the arms inspections team, shortly before the conflict in Iraq. His report of 6 March 2003 to the Security Council said that many questions on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remained unanswered. Resolution 1441 called for Iraq to provide a &ldquo;currently accurate, full and complete declaration&rdquo; of its programmes of weapons of mass destruction and demanded that Iraq &ldquo;co-operate immediately, unconditionally, and actively with UNMOVIC and the IAEA&rdquo;. The reality was that Iraq was in material breach of its disarmament obligations through its failure to fully co-operate with the arms inspectors in carrying out their mandate of verifying that Iraq no longer held weapons of mass destruction.</P>
        <P>Ireland's approach has consistently supported the UN role. The Government publicly and repeatedly stated it was for the UN Security Council to determine the existence of a threat to peace and its removal. It also wanted the council to decide the measures to be taken if its decisions were not respected or implemented in full. We supported the work of the weapons inspections teams throughout the crisis. On 5 March 2003, in this House, I called for them to continue the inspections process for as long as they, and the members of the Security Council, considered it necessary and worthwhile.</P>
        <P>In December 2003 the EU adopted a strategy against the proliferation of WMD at the European Council. Support for the multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, and fostering the role of the United Nation's Security Council with regard to WMD, will be central <Col N="697"/>elements in addressing their proliferation and means of delivery. Discussions with our EU partners are focusing on how best these elements might be implemented.</P>
        <P>Our action in this area will seek to render multilateralism more effective by acting resolutely against proliferators. In order to carry out the verification of proliferating activities that are a potential threat to international peace and security, we will work to enable the Security Council to benefit from independent expertise and a pool of readily available competence. In that context, we will consider how the verification and inspection experience of UNMOVIC could be retained and utilised, for example by setting up a roster of experts.</P>

	<P>In 1998 my Department initiated the ICT in schools programme against the background of a relatively low level of provision in schools at the time. In the past five years &euro;140 million was invested. The money covered grants for computer equipment, ICT training and support programmes for teachers and a range of support services for schools. The general objectives of the programme are to provide students with access to ICT enabled learning; to promote and develop a strong ICT skills base; and to enhance the quality of teaching and learning through ICT.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made since 1998. The average pupil to computer ratio has been reduced from 37:1 to just over 11:1 at primary level and from 16:1 to 9:4 at post-primary level. Every school has an Internet connection, albeit via a narrowband dial-up facility. Over 34,000 teachers availed of ICT training programmes that concentrated on ICT skills. More recently the programmes have evolved to deal with the practical application of ICT to enhance teaching and learning. ICT is also being included in pre-service training for teachers. A regional network of 20 educational ICT advisers has been put in place.</P>
        <P>Operating from the teacher education centres, the ICT advisory service is playing a key role in furthering effective use of ICT by supporting and advising principals and teachers on a range of ICT issues. A wide range of innovative pilot projects on various aspects of technology use in schools has been undertaken. There has also been significant engagement, at local level, in ICT planning and development in schools. Many schools receive significant support from parent groups, local communities, business and third level colleges.</P>
        <P>At the end of last year my Department completed a programme entitled Blueprint for the Future of ICT in Irish Education. At present it is formulating a policy plan for the period 2004 to 2007 for the continued integration of ICT into first and second level education.</P>
        <P>The policy plan will take into consideration the current status of integration in schools and assess the priorities for moving the process forward. Each element referenced in the Deputy's question will receive consideration within the policy plan and, having regard to individual priority ascribed and the finances available to me, will be the subject of a policy response. I hope <Col N="700"/>to soon be in a position to announce details of my deliberations.</P>

	<P>The availability to schools of broadband Internet access is one of a number of stated objectives of my Department's policy for promoting ICT in first and second level education. Broadband will significantly enhance the potential of ICT in teaching and learning in schools by facilitating whole class access to a wide range of multimedia applications through the Internet. It will also provide a much faster download of educational content and on-line communication and collaboration between school communities.</P>
        <P>Last year my Department commissioned a consultancy study on the options for providing broadband to schools. It took into account the practical issues of market ability to provide such connectivity, the range of delivery technologies available, timescale for delivery and cost. Since the completion of the report last August, detailed discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on a broadband implementation plan for schools. An announcement on the matter will be made shortly.</P>

	<P>Eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. They do not refer applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, for example, where advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. To date no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case. Applicants that believe they were unjustly refused a maintenance grant or it was insufficient may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>When an applicant's appeal is turned down, in writing, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, a local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. Unfortunately, neither me nor my Department can depart from the terms of the maintenance grant schemes in individual cases. To date no grant application has been received by either Kildare County Council or County Kildare VEC in this case.</P>

	<P>The introduction of a road safety and driver education syllabus in schools was examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. This was done on foot of a report from a task group that included representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College Crumlin, the CCEA Northern Ireland and the NCCA. Dr. Ray Fuller, Trinity College, Dublin was commissioned by the NCCA to carry out a further report on the topic.</P>
        <P>The NCCA recommended that road safety be addressed in the context of social, personal and health education. It also recommended that driver education, specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17 years, should not become part of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted that its recommendations concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the start of the school year 2001-02 the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, issued copies of Staying Alive, a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle, to all second level schools. The<Miles com="jy"/>pack provided a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM, with additional material downloaded from the Internet, was included in the pack along with copies of rules of the road.</P>
        <P>During the preparation of the Staying Alive resource material views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue the material was piloted in 20 schools across Ireland and the response from teachers was very positive.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 209 together.</P>
        <P>Historically, there are no defined catchment areas in large urban centres. Pupils generally tend to gravitate to schools nearest their residence. Choice is usually made on the basis of curricular <Col N="703"/>options on offer in a school, differing ethos and the nature of provision, such as single sex or co-educational provision. There are three post-primary providers in the south inner city of Dublin, namely, Christian Brothers School, Westland Row, St. Mary's secondary school, Haddington Road, and the Technical Institute, Ringsend.</P>
        <P>The principal of Westland Row CBS applied for a new post-primary school. Given the current combined enrolment of the three schools in the south inner city area is 444 pupils, my Department is exploring the possibility of a single school development to facilitate the needs of the area with the relevant trustees. Accommodation options for a single school campus are being examined as part of the process.</P>
        <P>The application mentioned a site in the area of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. Following discussions with the authority, officials from my Department's school planning section are satisfied that a site in the area is not a viable option due principally to the limited area available.</P>

	<P>The school building programme for 2004 as published is focused towards the construction of large scale new building projects which were in the advanced stages of architectural planning. The proposed extension project at Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s is currently in the early stages of architectural planning and, consequently, did not feature on the 2004 programme.</P>
        <P>However, given the difficulties being experienced at the school, my Department is anxious to provide a speedy solution to meet the short to medium term needs of the school. In this regard, it is prepared to provide permanent high quality modular accommodation in accordance with a schedule of accommodation to be agreed with the school authority. This type of accommodation is widely used in other countries and has been used here in the Prison Service. In addition, my Department satisfactorily piloted an entire new second level school in Cabra last year using this type of accommodation. The main advantage of modular accommodation is the speed with which it can be delivered. It is also permanent in nature and can be demounted for use elsewhere as circumstances at individual schools change. It is envisaged that the remainder of the accommodation required at Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s can be provided using the same delivery method under next year's capital programme.</P>
        <P>However, if the school authority wishes to follow the traditional building delivery method, its project will be included in a re-evaluation of all projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 programme with a view to <Col N="713"/>including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. This re-evaluation will take place following completion of a review of the prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which is currently taking place with the education partners.</P>

Newly established schools are generally required to undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide suitable accommodation. This accommodation should be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>An application for permanent recognition for the school has been received and is currently under consideration in the school planning section of my Department. As part of the examination, factors such as the long-term viability of the school, current and projected enrolments and suitability of accommodation will be considered. A decision on the school's application will be made as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>There are five children detention schools under the aegis of my Department. The schools provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts. The five schools currently have a combined operational capacity of 115 boys and 15 girls. The operational capacity may fluctuate from time to time to accommodate refurbishment and new developments, fire, health and safety or security concerns and current child care practices.</P>
        <P>The number of occupied beds and the number of vacancies in respect of each of the five schools as at 31 January 2004 is as follows: 
Trinity House School, 
18 occupied beds and 9 vacancies; 
Oberstown Boys Centre, 
20 occupied beds and no vacancies; 
Oberstown Girls Centre. 
9 occupied beds and 6 vacancies; 
Finglas Child &amp; Adolescent Centre,
21 occupied beds and 7 vacancies; 
St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, 
25 occupied beds and 15 vacancies.</P>

        <P>A key consideration for my Department in commencing the Children Act 2001 is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required under the new arrangements. An independent internationally recognised expert in the field of residential care <Col N="720"/>was commissioned by my Department to review the residential requirements for children's detention schools. This review does not envisage any significant change in requirements in the short term.</P>
        <P>In the medium to long-term the review suggests that with the implementation of the Children Act 2001, and the increasing availability of early intervention measures and alternatives to custody envisaged, there will be a reduction in demand for residential places for young offenders. The views of the Special Residential Services Board on the report were received by my Department and are currently being considered.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of one learning support teacher and three resource teaching posts. I can confirm, also, that my Department has received applications from the school for special educational resources, SER, in respect of a number of children in December, 2002 and January and February, 2003. I understand that professional reports in support of the applications were made available to my Department by the school in July 2003.</P>
        <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this process completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of <Col N="721"/>resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has<Miles com="jy"/>given its approval to the development of two<Miles com="jy"/>500 MW east-west Ireland-Wales electricity interconnectors, as a priority.</P>
        <P>The Government decision will involve, in the first instance, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, being charged with promoting and assessing the degree of interest in the development of merchant interconnectors to be constructed, managed and owned by the private sector and not by the Government.</P>
        <P>In the event of no substantive interest emerging on the part of the private sector for a merchant interconnector type project, the CER will then move to host a competition for construction, management and ownership of regulated interconnectors, underpinned by a guaranteed regulated revenue stream covering costs, either in whole or in part. Any CER competition arrangements would seek to maximise risk transfer from and minimise costs to the consumer downstream. By virtue of the fact that the competition would be open, the results will dictate management options. While it is not possible at this stage to give a detailed timescale for build, the target date for commencement of capital works on the interconnector is by end 2006 or earlier if possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue <Col N="722"/>raised by the Deputy regarding postal deliveries in Drogheda is an operational matter for the board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function. The ongoing industrial action is fundamentally a matter for the board and management of An Post and the unions involved.</P>
        <P>However, I understand that the current industrial action in Drogheda is unofficial and I would urge all concerned to operate agreed industrial relations mechanisms to facilitate a return to normal working arrangements and to restore the levels of service, which An Post customers are entitled to expect.</P>
        <P>The shareholder, company and employees negotiated a transformation through partnership agreement in 2000 which aimed to prepare An Post for the challenges arising from the liberalisation of the postal market and electronic substitution products such as e-mail.</P>
        <P>Since the negotiation of the agreement in 2000, the financial situation in An Post has deteriorated significantly, and it is now even more critical for all stakeholders in An Post to implement the necessary strategies to return the company to profitability and copperfasten its long-term future in the postal market.</P>

        <Quest>the purpose and outcome of the meeting in October 2003 between the <Col N="723"/>monitoring committee and the Irish Coursing Club; if he plans any legislative or policy initiative in light of the need to introduce drag coursing here in view of the success of this alternative to live hare coursing in Australia, the USA and Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that under section 26 of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, the Irish Coursing Club is recognised as being the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds, subject to the provisions of the Act and of the constitution of the club and subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon.</P>
        <P>The monitoring committee, comprising officials of my Department, veterinary and livestock breeding experts from the Department of Agriculture and Food, representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Bord na gCon held its annual meeting with the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, on 23 October 2003. The purpose of this meeting was to review the 2002-03 coursing season and to discuss control procedures for the 2003-04 season.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing drag coursing was discussed at the meeting. The ICC informed the committee that the muzzling of coursing greyhounds and the continued veterinary inspections by both the coursing clubs and the Department of Agriculture and Food have significantly reduced the incidence of injuries to hares. The Department of Agriculture and Food veterinary inspectors agreed to attend approximately 10% of meetings for the 2003-04 on behalf of my Department, while wildlife rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service will continue to attend approximately 50% of all coursing meetings and issue reports to my Department. In light of these initiatives, I do not propose to introduce changes in legislation to introduce drag coursing in Ireland.</P>

        <QRef>[5336/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under EU rules, only authorised GM foods, or foods containing ingredients thereof, can be imported and placed on the market. Ireland applies EU legislation on genetically modified, GM, foods.</P>
        <P>The following GM foods are authorised for sale on the Irish market: vegetable oil from oil seed rape; vegetable oil from cotton seed; maize products; soya products. These products are normally used as food ingredients and the following are the food types in which the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, have identified GM ingredients: vegetable casserole, gluten-free reduced sugar rusks, soya protein mince, soya protein chunks, soya biscuits and cakes, soya bran, soya flour, infant formula, soya cream, soya yoghurt, soya drink, soya dessert, lecithin granules derived from soya bean and maize meal, tortilla chips, taco shells, breadcrumbs for chicken and burger and corn snacks derived from maize.</P>
        <P>However, the above list does not mean that there are not other food types on the market with GM maize or soya ingredients. Further authorisations of GM foods will only occur following full independent safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority and will also be subject to the latest European regulations with regard to traceability and labelling.</P>
        <P>Several EU regulations, including 258/97, 1139/98, 49/2000, 50/2000, govern the labelling of food products containing genetically modified <Col N="725"/>organisms, GMOs. These have been updated by two new regulations, 1829/2003, which repeals 1139/98, 49/2000, 50/2000, and 1830/2003. These regulations which become applicable in April of this year, amend the current rules on the labelling of foods produced from GMOs to require labelling irrespective of whether DNA or protein of GM origin is present in the final product. Consequently, highly refined or processed food such as starch, sugar and oil products which may not have any residual DNA or protein will nonetheless require labelling if derived from GMOs. A traceability system will also be put in place to verify the origin of the food. Labels will have to indicate either &ldquo;This product contains genetically modified organisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;... produced from genetically modified, name of organism&rdquo;. Operators will have to comply with these new provisions on labelling from April 2004.</P>
        <P>Trace levels of GMOs in conventional food and feed can and do arise during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing. This is not particular to GMOs but can occur in the production of food, feed and seed with the result that it is very difficult to achieve products that are 100% pure. Against this background, the EU's objective is to ensure legal certainty and establish certain thresholds above which conventional food and feed have to be labelled as consisting of, or containing, or being produced from a GMO.</P>
        <P>Under current legislation the presence of GM material in conventional food does not have to be labelled if it is below 1% and if it can be shown to be adventitious and technically unavoidable. The EU has now revised this to a threshold of no higher than 0.9% that will apply from April of 2004.</P>
        <P>The FSAI is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs: the FSAI carries out checks on the marketplace for compliance with GM legislation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I launched the report on &ldquo;The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland&rdquo; in October 2003. Its recommendations have been accepted by <Col N="729"/>Government. The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the report's recommendations is the single most important priority in cancer services in the acute hospital setting. The Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to the efficacy of developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
        <P>The report considers that there will be a need for continued review of service development given the additional treatment capacity requirements that have been identified to 2015 and beyond. The report emphasises that the published analyses of radiation therapy care and therapeutic outcome in the context of outreach or satellite facilities is quite limited. Such developments internationally are very recent and are being established against a background of significant pre-existing radiation oncology treatment resources. This is not the current situation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In recent years, for example, there has been a limited development of satellite facilities in Britain, Norway, Canada and Australia. The analysis of clinical and operational success and the difficulties encountered by these in smaller centres is not yet available. The report emphasises that it will be important to ensure that any future outreach service or collaboration with independent private centres would provide the technical and clinical quality commensurate with what is believed to be achievable with the initial phase of large centre development advocated in the report. The expert group considers that the maintenance of professional competence, and possibly morale, in any future outreach or small treatment facility with few staff, where sub-specialisation is not possible, will continue to be a significant challenge.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a coordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report.

These conditions affect a number of systems such as food allergies resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms, allergies to substances in the environment which may lead to a variety of skin conditions, and the one which has been most widely researched and reported, that of an apparent increase in the prevalence of asthma in both children and adults.</P>
        <P>Some of these phenomena may be explained by more sophisticated diagnostic and investigative techniques which allow for the more frequent identification of conditions whose pathology and causation were previously unknown. However, it is generally accepted, not only in Ireland but in the western world in general, that there appears to have been a real increase in the incidence of asthma which is not solely explained by reference per diagnostic techniques. This was confirmed in a study which was carried out on asthma in Ireland by Allen and Hanburys in conjunction with the Asthma Society in 2001. This research extended a previous study which was carried out in seven countries in Europe in 1999 which confirmed that among the European Union countries, there are also variations in asthma prevalence.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that some of the factors which may influence this situation include environmental factors, not only smoking and workplace exposure to respiratory irritants, but a more general level of exposure to environmental substances which cause allergies to occur. At the forthcoming meeting of European Union chief medical officers, the chief medical officer of my Department has placed the issues of food and asthma on the agenda so that we can share experiences, information and knowledge with our EU partners on this issue.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has contacted the health research board to discuss the issue of research into the incidence of asthma in the Irish population and the establishment of an asthma register is under discussion between professionals dealing with asthma and the ERHA. These <Col N="731"/>initiatives should help to elucidate more clearly some of the causative factors relating to these conditions and, more specifically, to identify factors which contribute to the allergic component of this and other conditions. Thus, preventive and treatment strategies can be more effectively developed and implemented.</P>

I am informed by the NRA that the proposed route is not at this time part of<Miles com="jy"/>its current programme of national road improvement works in planning.

        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, when the go-ahead was given to proceed with the installation of the above 17 town centre <Col N="734"/>CCTV systems, it was decided that the implementation of the CCTV systems in those locations should proceed on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>If work were to commence at all 17 locations simultaneously, it would prove difficult to project-manage due to the complexity of the process and the geographical distribution of the proposed systems. Additional resources would also be required.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the response by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on my behalf, to the similar matter put down by him for the Adjournment debate of Wednesday, <Col N="735"/>11 February 2004, which dealt comprehensively with the Government's strategy on drugs.</P>
        <P>Regarding the enforcement area, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the primary role in enforcing the laws regarding drugs and tackling the individuals and organisations that profit from drug trafficking. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the policing response to the issue centres on several basic principles, namely: conducting intelligence-driven operations against criminal networks involved in drug distribution at both a national and international level; undermining the structures and systems which support that activity; depriving criminal organisations of the proceeds arising from drug trafficking and related activities; and working with communities and organisations endeavouring to reduce both the demand and supply of drugs in society.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets out its strategies in its annual policing plans, which task Garda units operating at a national level to counteract organised crime, drug trafficking and money laundering. Those include not only the Garda national drugs unit, but also the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Garda bureau of fraud investigation. All the activities of those units are co-ordinated under the assistant commissioner responsible for national support services. Those units work in close co-operation with several dedicated divisional drug units, which are tasked with addressing drug distribution at a local level.</P>
        <P>The activities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating organised crime associated with drug trafficking have recorded considerable successes in apprehending those involved, as well as seizing substantial quantities of drugs.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works with communities and organisations seeking to reduce the demand for drugs. That includes active participation on the five local drug task forces operating on the north side of Dublin, as well as community policing forums operating in both the north inner city and Cabra areas. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also initiated 64 diversionary projects throughout the State aimed at addressing the needs of young people at risk from a variety of issues, including substance misuse. Ten of those projects operate on the north side of Dublin.</P>
        <P>While it is acknowledged that substance misuse continues to be a significant issue, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's successes in tackling criminal drug activity have been considerable. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is strictly enforced on Dublin's north side, with a dedicated staff of three sergeants and 14 garda&iacute; in addition to those performing regular mobile and foot patrols.</P>

        <P>In such cases when the person has an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the application will simply be returned, which was the case with the application referred to by the Deputy.

	<P>In January 1996, the Government gave approval for the construction of a new women's prison at the Mountjoy Prison complex. The construction of the women's prison, to house 60 offenders, commenced early in 1997 and was completed in April 1999. The construction cost was 13.5 million, or &euro;17.2 million, which included all the costs associated with the construction of both the new prison and a 300-space multi-storey car park, adjacent to St. Patrick's Institution, to service the entire prison complex at Mountjoy. Roughly one quarter of the costs is attributable to the multi-storey car park.</P>
        <P>The new women's prison became known as the D&oacute;chas centre. The total cost of maintenance and improvement works for the D&oacute;chas centre over the past five years since it opened has been &euro;986,603.02.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>When assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters. Those include whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that: the applicant's stated purpose of visit is his or her true purpose of visit; the applicant is in a position to support him- or herself fully while in the State; the applicant will fully honour the conditions of the visa &mdash; for example, is unlikely to overstay the length of time applied for or work without a work permit; the applicant is unlikely to breach the common travel area by travelling from the State to Great Britain or Northern Ireland without an appropriate entry visa.</P>
        <P>The visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in his or her country of origin, his or her immigration history, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of his or her remaining in the State. Credibility is central to <Col N="738"/>the visa determination process. The Department's approach in those matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system; not surprisingly, inconsistencies on the face of the application can cause the visa officer to conclude that the above-mentioned matters have not been satisfied.</P>
        <P>The persons in question made visa applications in October 2003 to enable them to come to the State for business purposes. The visa officer, in deciding on the applications, considered that there was insufficient evidence, on the basis of the documentation supplied, to show that the stated purpose of the visit was the true purpose. Inconsistencies were also noted in the information supplied. In the circumstances, the visa officer formed the opinion that it would not be reasonable to conclude that the applicants would observe the conditions attached to the visa.</P>
        <P>Reasons for the refusal of the applications were issued on 16 December 2003 on request from the reference in Ireland. Representations were received from the Deputy appealing against the refusal of the visas. It was noted that the applicants' reference in Ireland stated that he wished to finalise a &euro;500,000 business contract with the applicants' company. However, the applicants' business bank account statement which accompanied the visa applications showed a balance of approximately &euro;1,500. Taking that and other inconsistencies into account, both applications were refused on appeal.</P>

	<P>For the purpose of this question, a juvenile is taken to be a person under 18 years of age. Statutory responsibility for the provision of spaces for young offenders under the age of 16 years lies with the Minister for Education and Science. I have statutory responsibility for the provision of spaces for persons of 16 years of age and over.</P>
        <P>There is a wide range of non-custodial options, including probation, deferment of sentence under supervision and community service orders for young persons who have pleaded guilty to an offence in court. At any one time there are approximately 600 young persons serving various types of sentence in the community. In addition, there are 25 residential places, funded by the probation and welfare service, for offenders aged under 18 years. There is also a range of non-custodial placements-projects available for this age group.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures which will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour, establishes the Special Residential Services Board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention, and re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. The Act is complex and comprehensive legislation and for this reason provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and the Department of Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-<Col N="743"/>ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</P>
        <P>It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in circumstances where other alternative diversions and community based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>
        <P>The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act will require a significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, the probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand, for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act, as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</P>
        <P>From September 2003 to date, 14 additional permanent probation and welfare officers and three temporary probation and welfare officers have taken up duty and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited, community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented in 2004.</P>
        <P>Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</P>
        <P>In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick's Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles &mdash; 90 male and 20 female &mdash; is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Irish Prison <Col N="744"/>Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, will not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>The most significant criminal justice interventions directed at diverting young people away from crime and anti-social behaviour are the Garda juvenile diversion programme and youth diversion projects. In stating this, I understand by diversion is meant the process of preventing young people from entering the formal criminal justice system in the first place. If and when criminal prosecution and conviction occur, many interventions designed to prevent re-offending are available, particularly those provided by the probation and welfare service.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to dealing with juveniles who offend is to consider the offender for inclusion in the Garda juvenile diversion programme. This programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.</P>
        <P>The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na responsible for administering the programme at the local level. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the year 2003, the Garda national juvenile office received 19,915 referrals under the programme relating to 17,050 individual offenders. The Deputy should note that these figures are provisional and are subject to a validation process. The programme is delivered throughout the country by 85 garda&iacute; and eight sergeant juvenile liaison officers who are employed full-time working with juvenile offenders.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion. To facilitate these innovative developments, most of the Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected officers. Since the commencement of the <Col N="745"/>relevant part of the Children Act 2002 and up to the end of September 2003, almost 100 restorative justice events have been held. Early assessments indicate a very high level of satisfaction from all those involved in the<Miles com="jy"/>process.</P>
        <P>Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. It is intended that as Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, they will be able to focus on the more complex and high risk offenders, with a view to further reducing the incidence of recidivism.</P>
        <P>To ensure the effective operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme in accordance with section 44 of the Act, a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the programme, review all aspects of its operation and monitor the ongoing training needs of facilitators involved in restorative conferencing was established in June 2003.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects are in place. These projects are a community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
        <P>On the basis of commissioned evaluations of the Garda youth diversion projects, my Department, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other key stakeholders, commissioned the centre for social and educational research at the Dublin Institute of Technology to prepare comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of projects. It is anticipated that these guidelines will act as a benchmark against which applications for new projects will be assessed and against which existing projects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. The guidelines were officially launched at the Garda youth diversion projects annual conference in May 2003.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided on according to local needs by the Garda authorities in conjunction with my Department. Funding of &euro;5.318 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.</P>
        <P>In summary, the Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice <Col N="746"/>system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all circumstances, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turning in the process of maturing into young adults. Moreover, research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 88% do not come to the attention of<Miles com="jy"/>the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na again by their 18th<Miles com="jy"/>birthday.</P>

	<P>Child care was identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000-06. An important aspect of the national development plan is the inclusion of two regional operational programmes. The common aim of these regional programmes is the achievement of more balanced regional development. In this context, the principle sources of funding for child care over the period of the national development plan are the two regional programmes.</P>
        <P>The total amount of funding allocated to my Department for child care purposes over the seven year period of the national development plan is &euro;437 million. Of this amount, &euro;317 million comes under the regional operational programmes. At this stage of the programme, approximately &euro;250 million has been committed in funding, of which &euro;206 million has been allocated in capital and staffing grants to child care providers and community groups and &euro;43 million to quality improvement.</P>
        <P>When determining the level of funding which might be allocated to a particular group a number of factors are taken into consideration by my Department. The five principal factors taken into consideration are: the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant to implement the project; the level of integration-co-ordination; and costings and value for<Miles com="jy"/>money.</P>
        <P>The total value of the applications presently on hand in my Department is &euro;217 million. This figure is unlikely to be the total value of the funding which will ultimately be allocated to these projects as the amount of funding requested <Col N="747"/>by the applicants rarely matches the amount of funding which a project is allocated following the appraisal of the application. However, it is fair to say that a significant part of the remaining funding will be used to meet the ongoing costs of supporting child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>During 2003 a mid-term evaluation of each of the regional operational programmes was carried out in partnership between the European Commission, the managing authorities and the implementing bodies as required under EU structural fund regulations. The purpose of these evaluations was to gauge the effectiveness of the programmes and to assess their impact in terms of meeting their core objectives. In general, the social inclusion and child care priorities of both regional programmes were thought to have been well designed and had impacted positively in deprived areas and on young people.</P>
        <P>An important aim of the mid-term evaluation is to provide a suitable framework for making informed decisions about setting priorities for the second phase of the regional programmes and for making any adjustments, such as changes to the community support framework, which might have become necessary. This post-evaluation review, which involves all the parties concerned with funding, managing and implementing the regional programmes, will look at all aspects of the programmes but, in particular, the effectiveness, progress and continued relevance of the priorities and measures, including the child care measures, making up both programmes.</P>
        <P>While both post-evaluation reviews are ongoing, it is expected that some new proposals will be brought to the spring monitoring committee meetings of the regions concerned. It is still too early to say how this process might impact on the equal opportunities child care programme. However, it is clear that there has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities.</P>
        <P>In the context of the post-evaluation review and in the interests of effective management of the programme, my Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all the remaining funding<Miles com="jy"/>in accordance with the objectives of the programme.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the future management of the open centres at Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow, and Loughan House, County Cavan, was the subject of a Government decision on 11 November 2003. That decision approved a series of measures to be taken on a rolling basis with effect from 1 January 2004 in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish Prison Service. These measures included the mothballing of the Curragh Place of Detention and Fort Mitchel Place of Detention and the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into independently managed post-release centres for the re-integration into society of prisoners on strict terms of temporary release similar to the<Miles com="jy"/>existing arrangements for prisoners at both centres.</P>
        <P>The reasons for the Government decision have been well aired in the House and in the Seanad. I refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debates in the House on 12, 18 and 27 November 2003 and to an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on 19 November 2003. In the course of those debates, I made it clear that the Irish Prison Service could not continue to spend public money to feed an overtime culture, which was virtually out of control, while sustaining outdated and inefficient work practices. I also made it clear that I had no desire to close or mothball prisons and that my preference was for a mutually advantageous agreement with the Prison Officers' Association which would ensure an efficient and cost effective prison service into the future. My position has not changed in that regard.</P>
        <P>As regards the progress of discussions between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers' Association, the Deputy will be aware that those discussions were taking place at the Labour Relations Commission with the assistance of a facilitator and that an impasse was reached between the parties during the past month. Talks were adjourned on 30 January 2004 to allow both sides time to reflect on how the difficulty might be overcome. I am happy that discussions at the Labour Relations Commission resumed on 16 February 2004 and will reconvene on 20 February 2004. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the progress of those discussions.</P><Col N="749"/>
        <P>As regards the future of Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, I have indicated on numerous occasions that my preference is for these open centres to continue to be operated by the prison service and staffed by prison officers. I am hopeful that an agreement can be reached with the Prison Officers' Association on a mutually acceptable way forward. However, there will be no option but to proceed with the transfer of these centres to new management in the event that agreement is not reached.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, ODCA, took a case to the High Court in 2001 under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, and with the support of my Department. The subsequent High Court Order (December 2001) prohibited the use of 15 &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; terms in house building contracts and also prohibited stage payments in house building contracts, which exceed the percentages stipulated in the Irish Home Builders Association (IHBA) code of practice or which exceed &ldquo;the extent and value of works carried out at the date specified for the payment in question&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The IHBA code of practice stipulates that in the case of a purchaser who obtains the title to the site prior to the completion of the transaction, three distinct stage payments may be required, namely at joist level (i.e. 25%); at roof level (i.e. 25%); and at internal plastering stage (i.e. 25%), in addition to a booking deposit (4%); contract deposit (11%); and completion payment (10%). Site costs are the subject of a separate contract. The IHBA code of practice may be accessed on the Construction Industry Federation website at <i>www.cif.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>All local authorities required to do so have prepared and adopted five year Traveller accommodation programmes in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. Under their programmes, local authorities provide new Traveller accommodation including Traveller specific accommodation units as well as refurbishing existing accommodation to modern standards. Local authorities are not allocated a specific number of starts for Traveller specific accommodation each year.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the accommodation provided in 2002 and 2003. Figures shown in this table include Traveller specific accommodation as well as standard local authority accommodation provided for Traveller families.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The changes made in 1994, which have effect for local electoral purposes only, were made following agreement by the local elected councils concerned. However since the introduction in 1996 of a modern boundary alteration code (under the Local Government Act 1991), it has been open to a local authority, as a reserved function, to initiate a boundary alteration proposal to have effect for all purposes. Such an alteration would supersede any electoral boundary changes made in 1994. A number of applications for local authority boundary alterations, to have effect for all purposes, have been made and implemented in recent years.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the 1991 Act will, as part of the consolidation of local government law being effected under the Local Government Act 2001, be repealed and replaced. Under the 2001 Act provisions an independent Local Government Commission will recommend as to local authority boundary alteration: or it may as an alternative in a particular case recommend the introduction of revised arrangements for service delivery in the area concerned. The commission will be able to act on foot of an application by a local authority (a decision of the elected members) or at the request of the Minister. It is intended that the provisions of the 2001 Act will be commenced in the coming months, as part of an ongoing programme to complete its full implementation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussions have been underway for some time in relation to putting in place arrangements, to be operated by the local authorities, to meet the housing needs of people who would otherwise have to rely on a long-term basis on rent supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>The objective is that local authorities should have available a comprehensive range of options to meet long-term housing needs and that applicants for State supports in relation to housing needs should have their housing needs assessed by a single authority which is in a position to select the best response in light of <Col N="755"/>their particular needs and all the available options.</P>
        <P>Arising from these discussions, an action plan is now being finalised. The action plan will include criteria for determining which categories of rent supplement recipient will be eligible to participate in the new arrangements, an implementation timescale, financing and other matters.</P>
        <P>While there is full agreement that people with long-term housing needs require a housing response rather than a social welfare payment, and considerable progress has been made in developing practical proposals in that regard, all of the details of how and when the new arrangements will be implemented in practice have not yet been finalised. Discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard are continuing and I expect to be in a position to seek final Government approval for the action plan in the near future.</P>

        <Quest>the compensation package available at present to former miners who are suffering from health complications, primarily of a respiratory nature as a result of their former employment conditions; and if the levels of compensation or monetary support available to the aforementioned individuals are to be increased accordingly in line with inflation and the increasing cost of health care.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts. A person who is unable to work due to an incapacity arising from his-her employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive disability benefit subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for that payment.</P>
        <P>A person may be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. The degree of disablement is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender. The degree of disablement is expressed as a <Col N="756"/>percentage, loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.</P>
        <P>Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable only if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease due to the nature of that employment. The legislation describes, in relation to each of the listed diseases, the occupations where in normal circumstances there would be a reasonable presumption that the disease was work related. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement and the rate of benefit payable is based on this.</P>
        <P>A number of former miners have sought disablement benefit payments. Miners who contracted pneumoconiosis are entitled to occupational injury benefit and may also receive disablement benefit. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not a recognised disease for this scheme. However, any award of disablement benefit will reflect the presence of COPD.</P>
        <P>Where a person has qualified for occupational injuries benefits, the rate of benefit payable increases on an annual basis in line with the normal social welfare budget increases. In addition, where a person feels that his/her occupational injury has deteriorated since the assessment was made under the scheme, it is open to that person to apply for a review of the percentage calculated. If it is successfully demonstrated that this is the case, the disablement percentage assessed will be raised and the pension payable will consequently increase.</P>
        <P>Where a disablement pensioner is incapable of work as a result of their occupational accident/disease and does not qualify for any other social welfare payment an income support payment, unemployability supplement, is paid as an increase to the disablement pension.</P>
        <P>Additionally, where a disablement pensioner is in need of care a constant attendance allowance can be paid weekly as an increase to a disablement pension. This is payable to persons who are so seriously disabled as to need someone to help them daily at home to attend to their personal needs for a period of at least six months. The award of the allowance is based on the recommendation of the Department's medical advisor. To qualify for this payment the person must be in receipt of a disablement pension of 50% or over.</P>
