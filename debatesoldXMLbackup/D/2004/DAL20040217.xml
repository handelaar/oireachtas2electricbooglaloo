      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9 together.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P>The Government has no proposals at present to hold a referendum to change the Constitution. The position continues to be held under review in light of developments, including: the outcome of the examination by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution of property rights issues; the outcome of the study being conducted by a sub-committee on procedures and privileges on reform of the Seanad; and the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference on the draft constitutional treaty which commenced in Rome on 4 October.</P>
        <P>It is difficult at this stage to say when the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Conference might be concluded. However, as holders of the Presidency, we will be making every effort to progress the IGC during our term in office.</P>
        <P>The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations which have emanated from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In all, the previous Government brought forward nine referenda. The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee.</P>
        <P>The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Taoiseach for the efforts he has made to date in meeting all the leaders of the EU and accession countries. If it is possible, it is particularly important that this matter should be concluded during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. Personally, I would not regard it as a failure of Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question for the Taoiseach relative to Questions Nos. 1 to 9?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is being very touchy because &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair will not accept that sort of remark from Deputy Kenny. It is quite obvious that Questions Nos. 1 to 9 deal with the Oireachtas &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me to explain. They are quite obvious. The first question is about constitutional matters. The Chair knows as well as I do that if the Taoiseach in his capacity as President of the EU is able to conclude the IGC, the matter will have to be put to a constitutional referendum of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may talk about a constitutional referendum but not about how we arrive at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about constitutional matters. The Chair knows that if the Taoiseach <Col N="4"/>can conclude this matter successfully, it must then go before the people by virtue of the fact that they must vote on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing the constitution of Europe but a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a constitutional matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question relative to a referendum in this country on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have but the Chair has refused to allow me to elaborate on my point. Does the Taoiseach consider that during this D&aacute;il a situation will arise where the people will have to vote on a constitution, hopefully to be concluded during the Irish Presidency? I hope that question is in order.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the Taoiseach stated that he would be willing to hold a constitutional referendum on property rights, if one was necessary to address the spiralling costs of development lands. It is obvious to anybody, and to the thousands of first-time house buyers and young people in general, that the cost of development lands has spiralled. With the abolition of the new house grant, the 1% increase in VAT and the imposition of development levies, this cost is increasing even more seriously. In that context, has the Taoiseach given consideration to what he said in 2003 about holding a constitutional referendum on property rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to the first question, it is almost definite that a referendum will be required during the life of this D&aacute;il to deal with the outcome of the IGC on the constitution. Whether that is concluded in the first or second half of this year or next year, it will have to be dealt with. It will almost certainly have to be put to the people in a formal referendum. So the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I have not changed my mind on the second issue. The Government has done an amount of work over the last year on the issue of property rights, going right back to the Kenny report and looking to current issues and case law. We have had debates on it here and are awaiting the all-party committee report, which I understand will be out in a matter of weeks. We will then have to come to a consideration of whether this issue can be dealt with legislatively, which some people feel is the case. I have my own view and think it will probably have to be dealt with constitutionally. However, we will wait for the outcome of the report and the work that is being done around it, and then the finalisation of the Attorney General's advice on the matter. My commitment still holds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to property rights. I would be interested to hear if he took note of the widespread calls made by people dealing with housing and homelessness, for a <Col N="5"/>right to shelter to be incorporated as a constitutional provision, explicitly including people with special housing needs. Has this matter been discussed and does the Government have any intention of acting on this call, which has been made repeatedly and continues to be made?</P>
        <P>Has the Attorney General's advice been sought on whether there is a need to amend the Constitution? In the Carrickmines judgment, for example, the judge ruled on it being unconstitutional to amend an Act by ministerial order. Will this have a bearing on the Government's plans for electronic voting? Has advice been sought on this? It is clear that the Government needs to consider a constitutional amendment on this matter.</P>
        <P>Has the Government urged the all-party committee to do any analysis of the impact of the proposed EU constitution on the Constitution? Given the detail involved and the significance of it, there may be a role for the all-party committee to examine it so that we can all be both better prepared for the EU constitution and that it can be better understood by the public. Will the Government make a recommendation to the all-party committee in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy's first question, there is no further progress other than what I referred to in regard to the property rights issue and the outstanding report. While we have done some work it has not been based around the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>What was the second question the Deputy asked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It was on Carrickmines and electronic voting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there is no constitutional change required. The Attorney General stated that we have to look to the base of legislation to see if there are similar legislative matters that would fall into the same category as that judgment, and that process is under way.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy's third question, clearly there is a role to try to ensure that there is as much understanding of the constitutional treaty as possible. This has been done here in the course of debate and by the committees of the House as well as by the Forum on Europe. I do not think there is any other initiative we can bring forward, but I accept that we should all work to this end.</P>
        <P>I am always open to looking at ways of bringing forward issues of this nature to the understanding of people as early as possible because, if I understand the Deputy's point, the more people understand the issues and the more debate that takes place on them, the greater the awareness of what people are asked to make a decision on. This applies not only in the EU constitutional issue, which thankfully this time is not as difficult as some of the previous constitutional issues around European matters. However, many of the <Col N="6"/>other areas are quite complex as well. The judgments that bring these issues forward are legally complex. This is the case even for people who are used to looking at legislation or those working in administrative jobs; it is extremely complex and the legal points are quite complex. Even the formula for questions that are put to the people is complex. I agree with the Deputy that it creates much confusion and requires understanding and programmes for explanation.</P>
        <P>On several of the other matters that are in consideration arising from the eight reports we have had to date, we have looked at how we might put these together in blocks as it would build up a good reservoir of information. Many of the issues are extremely complex. While we are looking at how they might be grouped, it is not easy to do so as it could lead to more confusion. At the same time, we cannot have referenda every second month. If we are to put issues to the people in blocks, we must put in place an educational process that is better than the one that currently exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on his last remarks, would the Taoiseach not agree that the best way is always to afford the people the opportunity to make that judgment and decision? I do not know that there are better ways than that &mdash; referral to the electorate for constitutional purposes is always the best way.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated his view that the issue of land and property rights will have to be addressed constitutionally. Does he recall that in the weeks prior to the Christmas recess, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats voted down a Sinn F&eacute;in motion that sought to enshrine in the Constitution the right to housing? Given what the Taoiseach has just said, will the Government introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to allow for the control of prices of housing land? The Taoiseach must recognise that the failure to do so has had a devastating effect on the ambition of young couples, including couples where both partners are wage earners, to proceed to home ownership through mortgage or other means. The effect of that is most particularly felt in the area the Taoiseach represents in the city of Dublin. In the greater Dublin area it has a devastating effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question to ask the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>As it seems likely that there will be a presidential election later this year, does the Government have proposals to bring forward a constitutional change and does the Taoiseach believe such change is required to extend the franchise to citizens north of the Border, in the six north-eastern counties of our country? Given that the President, were she domiciled in her own home, would not be able to vote for herself &mdash; she was not able to do so, what proposals does the Government have in this regard? If it is not a constitutional matter, does <Col N="7"/>the Taoiseach believe it should be legislated for in advance of the presidential election later this year? There is recognition that that is very important.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly raised the issue of ground rents since 1997 and my colleague, Deputy Morgan, has raised it since 2002. In his previous responses, the Taoiseach stated that there are possible constitutional difficulties with a Bill to abolish ground rents, yet it remains an intent in the Government's programme of legislation for each term. What advice has the Cabinet received from the Attorney General on the possible constitutional difficulties regarding a ground rents Bill? Will the Taoiseach publish the Attorney General's advice so that we can all be privy to his concerns?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add to what I said in reply to Deputy Kenny. The all-party committee has given urgent consideration to this issue. It has received written and oral submissions, held public hearings and will shortly make recommendations in its report. The Government also examined these matters in considerable detail last year. The Deputy will be aware that most of those who spoke on this issue have been opposed to anything I have said on it. While it is not an easy matter to deal with, it should be dealt with when we have the report of the all-party committee.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made a point about Deputy Sargent's question. The point with which I was agreeing was that many of the recommendations for constitutional change can be quite legalistic by their nature. What Deputy Sargent and I were referring to was the campaign to explain those issues in a manageable way. We held referenda during the previous D&aacute;il on the International Criminal Court and other matters. Few members of the public understood the issues. My point concerned the educational information process in that regard. One cannot have referenda all the time. One must try to group the issues.</P>
        <P>The Presidency was the subject of the third report. Recommendations have been made, but I do not think that there is any constitutional issue. The report concerned age and there were several examinations of issues such as whether the office of President should continue to exist, external relations, whether there should be direct elections, and whether the procedure for nominating presidential candidates was too restrictive. All these matters were examined along with various other issues concerning the Presidential Commission. However, no referendum is planned, and it is not necessary. I am not sure whether the franchise &mdash; who can vote on such issues &mdash; was addressed in that report. To the best of my knowledge, it was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach's position?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be wrong on that. Regarding a ground rents Bill, we have had several legislative changes to the Landlord And Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 over the past 25 years, and the legal advice for a considerable number of years has been that it is probably not possible to go further in the area. I am not totally familiar with all the arguments on all sides, but the Deputy can table a question to the Minister. However, it is not possible, outside the four or five Acts in which we have made changes, to find a way to make further progress. That has been the position to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach share&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy tables a question to the Minister, he will give him the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we anticipate a referendum regarding matters arising from the Abbeylara judgment? Does the Taoiseach accept that we cannot continue to inquire into every matter of public interest by relying on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921? Is it appropriate that we put in place a cheaper, speedier, more efficient way of disposing of some of these matters?</P>
        <P>Is it not the case that the Supreme Court struck down Abbeylara in specific circumstances relating to imputations against character that might arise in the grave matter of what may have been unlawful killing and that that is not appropriate to this House? However, most matters that arise pertaining to the spending of public money would be appropriate to this House, and, as the DIRT inquiry showed, can be dealt with by one of its committees. Does the Taoiseach intend to hold a referendum to that effect? Why did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, apparently promise that in the wake of various eruptions regarding the Flood tribunal only for it seemingly to go to ground with no sign of anything emerging now?</P>
        <P>Did the All-Party Committee on the Constitution find that there is no constitutional impediment to the Government intervening to deal with the price of building land, which is driving the cost of housing out of the reach of most average earners? In those circumstances, is it the intention of the Government to legislate and may we anticipate such legislation at an early date given that a further increase in the price of houses of the order of 13% was recorded last year?</P>
        <P>In light of the facts that this discussion recurs every few months at Question Time, the rainbow Government commissioned a report under Mr. <Col N="9"/>Ken Whitaker in 1996 and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has reported five or six times since then, to where is all this work leading? When I discussed this matter with the Taoiseach some months ago, he told me he would be clearer on it in the new year. Where is all the work on the Constitution going? Are we likely to have a referendum on a new Constitution at some stage or will we approach the issue on a piecemeal basis? Is it likely that any of the issues that have been the subject of recommendation by the all-party committee will be addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Abbeylara and the issues around it are not among the issues listed for constitutional change. The Commissions of Investigation Bill, the debate on Second Stage of which we await, will hopefully address some of the issues raised by the Deputy. I do not disagree and have stated before that the 1921 Act which operates in this country and deals with inquiries is lengthy and costly. The way in which it operates may make it difficult to bring finality to these issues, considering it is the same Act which operated prior to the foundation of the State and operates in Britain. There are major differences in how it operates.</P>
        <P>In the Government's examination of this matter, it was felt that the commission of investigations process provided for under the Bill would enable us to deal with most of the matters that would come before the House, and that the House would not be stuck with the same constitutional problems and difficulties that happened in the Abbeylara case. To the best of my knowledge, that is still the position, but I will raise the issue again with the Minister. I know the Bill has been published for some time and I will check why it is not moving on to Second Stage.</P>
        <P>On the issue of property rights, I am in favour of legislative changes if it is possible to make them. Much of the advice over the years has been that perhaps one would not get the same result. Without going into too much debate on the matter, there is an advantage to making legislative changes because it would perhaps be easier to achieve them in the House on these issues than to win a constitutional referendum. I have seen the storm that was thrown up by some of my remarks on this issue in recent years. When the debate about property rights arises or one gives an interview about them, one gets little support other than in the House and groups outside it become very exercised about what it means. Either way, there is an issue to be dealt with and I hope we can move on it quickly.</P>
        <P>On the third matter, we have had eight reports and the work which Deputy Rabbitte reminded me I had promised is now complete. We have done a summary of the recommendations and conclusions of all eight reports. The first was a progress report and much of the work outlined in it has taken place. The second report, which was on the Seanad, contributed to the debate on Seanad reform. I understand the Seanad report <Col N="10"/>will come forward in one block this week or next week. The third report was on the Presidency. Some years ago, when we gave our views on this matter, the Government did not come down in favour of legislative change in most of the areas. There are some outstanding issues which could be blocked in with other changes but they are not of enormous consequence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Some progress was made in the case of the courts and the Judiciary but the judicial oversight issue was not passed by the D&aacute;il and remains outstanding. The fifth report on abortion was put to the people and was defeated. The sixth progress report was on the referendum issue and most of that was dealt with by legislation. The seventh report dealt with Parliament. That report has been analysed and blocks of issues could be put to a referendum and some could be dealt with by legislation. I have a detailed note on the eighth report but no action has been taken on it.</P>
        <P>Many issues have been dealt with such as the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, recognition of local government, the scrutiny of EU business and the conduct of referenda. They have been dealt with by referendum or by legislation.</P>
        <P>I answered Deputy Rabbitte on a previous occasion on the proposal of a re-run of the Constitution. Following consideration by all those involved, it was decided against that action. The view is that the Constitution has lasted with few changes as against in other countries where there has been constitutional change. While there is a requirement to update the Constitution in many respects such as on the issue of gender, there is not a case for changing it in its totality. The point of view of those working on this report over the last year is that a valuable framework exists within which constitutional change can take place. Some of these issues can be systematically grouped together and put to the people in a referendum. None of these issues will change the world or need to be dealt with urgently. However, when the opportunity arises these issues should be grouped together to update the Constitution. When we are dealing with European or other issues which affect the Constitution, the work of the all-party committee could be included.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately it is the committee's view that only five or six issues are the most that can be put to the people at any one time. I have asked the committee to consider a grouping of the conclusions. It has produced a good report but it is a pity that more issues could not be grouped. There are many small changes required in the Constitution and only four or five can be dealt with at a time. I have asked the committee to consider the issue of gender in the Constitution and I do not see why all the issues to do with gender could not be grouped together. There are also some issues to do with language which could be dealt with together. I do not think it will confuse the people that much, quite frankly. I will <Col N="11"/>come back to Deputy Rabbitte on the Commissions of Investigation Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify a point. If the people managed to struggle with Mr. de Valera's Constitution in 1937, does the Taoiseach not think that in 2007 they would be able to struggle with a new Mr. Ahern's Constitution? I presume the Taoiseach will still be here in 2007. I am not entirely clear on the purpose of bringing in report after report if they are not acted upon.</P>
        <P>Can I take it that what the Taoiseach said to me in reply to the question about property rights, that in the event of the constitutional committee reporting that there is no constitutional impediment in the way of legislating, that his Government will legislate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I have an open enough mind on the other matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte. If we were to do this on the basis of five or six issues together, we would never finish, quite frankly. It would be 2017 and I certainly will not be here then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should not rule it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>At that stage the Taoiseach will be in the gallery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I will not even be doing that. Perhaps there is a case for examining this area. I am not against this, I have already said that the report that has been published in this area should be shared with the all-party committee. I am not sure if this has happened, but I have no difficulty with it. Many of the points are small and will not make much difference, and there is a reason the Government will not accept all of them. Implementation of some of the recommendations would make the Constitution better, more readable and more up to date. I will keep the matter under review, otherwise it will never come to an end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Taoiseach expect the report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on building land and property rights? Does he agree some of us have been raising this issue with him for seven years and that it is now an extremely urgent task? In light of his legislative commitment some moments ago, will the Taoiseach give a commitment to put a constitutional referendum to the people if the all-party committee finds that a constitutional amendment is necessary to control the price of building land? Will he accept that this is an urgent issue in view of the fact that the free hand given to land speculators in Dublin over the full duration of his two Governments has meant that young working people are shackled with massive mortgages for the next 30 years and that for 15 <Col N="12"/>of those 30 years those people will be paying not for bricks and mortar but for the obscene profits of land speculators? Will the Taoiseach agree that the legislation or a constitutional referendum is extremely urgent? Will he give a commitment that this problem will be resolved in a matter of months?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given my views on this issue many times and Deputy Higgins knows exactly what those views are. We await publication of the all-party committee's report, which I understand is due in a few months. The process has not been under way for seven years. The committee started its work about 16 or 17 months ago. The Kenny report was produced about 30 years ago. More houses have been built, by and large, for young people and starters in the past five years than in the previous 25 years. The Deputy's argument in this regard, therefore, does not stand up. Issues relating to land continue to exist. Deputy Higgins is aware that constitutional referenda are not held for the fun of it &mdash; one has to bring forward proposals that can be passed by the people. Many people involved with property such as houses and land have concerns about these issues. There is nothing near public support for wholesale changes in this regard, as is clear from the statements of many organisations. We need to consider whether this should be framed constitutionally or legislatively. There are clear questions about the price and availability of land here compared with other countries, and that has an effect on house prices. We should endeavour as best we can to do something about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask a different question, which the Taoiseach answered before. The all-party committee recommended that the right of emigrants to vote in national elections &mdash; to the D&aacute;il &mdash; should be confined to those who are ordinarily resident in this jurisdiction, and I support that. Will the Taoiseach confirm that he accepts that recommendation of the all-party committee? It remains to be seen whether the Government will change the system of appointments to the Seanad based on Senator O'Rourke's recommendations, but does the Taoiseach consider that it would be appropriate under the existing system to nominate to that House a person with an involvement in or an awareness, an understanding or a history of dealing with emigrant affairs?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will have had a report of a recent television programme which highlighted the plight of many of former navvies living in hostels in rundown English cities. In their working years, they gave their sweat and blood in the building of Britain and sent money home to keep their families alive. Pride in many cases does not allow them to return home. Concern for their plight should be rightly reflected in the Seanad by a representative with an understanding and awareness of their condition. Does the Taoiseach believe appropriate recognition would be given <Col N="13"/>by a suitable appointee to the Seanad? The Taoiseach has had the opportunity to make nominations in recent years; I do not know if he will in the future. Can we have his views on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are competing views as to how the numbers in the Seanad should be made up. I gave my views to the committee last September on the issue. I understand from the subsequent debate that took place and from meeting the committee on a number of occasions over the past six months that it will recommend that what is known as the Taoiseach's 11 be used in a different way and also that the overall formation of the Seanad be changed. It is also seeking participation by various groups such as emigrants.</P>
        <P>Many Members in both Houses have considerable experience of emigrant issues and speak frequently on them. These include Members who worked or were forced to work abroad. It is not always the case that current members of such organisations &mdash; as good as those organisations are &mdash; are the only ones who can represent these groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not against examining such a proposal. The Seanad can be used in a broader way to take account of representative groups. Some of these perhaps feel they should be represented in this House, but the Seanad can give them a part and role to play. I am not against that idea. I have always been in favour of the recommendation that people from outside of the State could hold seats in the Seanad. However, I am not in favour of half the Irish-American community voting in D&aacute;il elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a job to canvass them all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I faced their wrath many years ago when I told them that, while others told them the opposite. I will not change my mind on that issue.</P>
        <P>I will endeavour to process the Seanad report as soon as it comes out. I believe it will make new recommendations on the Taoiseach's 11 and the overall formation of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard the Taoiseach speak of competing views, how open his mind is and how referenda are not just for fun. That is obvious enough. Does the Taoiseach agree with having a five year electoral cycle, something the Green Party supports? I see the practicalities when he said that we cannot have referenda every second month. However, in allowing more opportunities for referenda, would he agree to a five year electoral cycle with a voting day for D&aacute;il, Seanad, local and presidential elections? Obviously, this would require the presidency term to be changed to five years and a limit of two terms per incumbent in the interests of <Col N="14"/>turnover. Is it possible to have the electoral cycle truncated to a five year cycle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House, in crystal clear terms, if an amendment to the Constitution is required to allow citizens in the Six Counties participate in future presidential elections? Will the Taoiseach bring forward such an amendment at this point? If it is not required will he bring forward legislation to accommodate the participation of citizens of the Six Counties in the expected presidential election in the autumn?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not envisage any change in the format for the presidential election in October. There will be no change from the present position, either constitutionally or legislatively.</P>

	<P>In response to Deputy Sargent's question we will endeavour to bring forward amendments. There are several constitutional issues to be dealt with in the coming years and the best way to deal with those will be to group some of the issues arising from the report with those, in as many instances as we can.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the apparent difficulties of the Revenue Commissioners in obtaining evidence to prosecute persons who defaulted on the fines of the tax amnesty and to prosecute officials within financial institutions who gave assistance to persons secreting money into bogus non-resident accounts.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4832/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it has not been possible in any cases examined to date to obtain the evidence necessary to meet the required standard of &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt" in amnesty non-compliance offences. It is generally the case also that where a taxpayer agrees to co-operate in an investigation and Revenue cannot otherwise access relevant evidence, the taxpayer's rights against self-incrimination will restrict the potential for a prosecution.</P>
        <P>I would, however, also remind the Deputy that apart from the amnesty aspect, Revenue has recently been successful in collecting outstanding tax and interest and in imposing civil penalties <Col N="15"/>on many tax evaders in its ongoing investigations. Individual tax evaders have made considerable retribution for their offences as a direct consequence of the large monetary settlements resulting from these investigations.</P>
        <P>Revenue's criminal investigation programmes have been re-focused recently with the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division. If in the course of investigations, amnesty offences are identified and the necessary evidence is available, they will be investigated with a view to taking a criminal prosecution for such offences. On the matter of the prosecution of officials from financial institutions who may have assisted in placing funds in bogus non-resident accounts, the primary responsibility for ensuring that a tax return is correct rests with the individual making that return. There is a statutory offence in the tax code of knowingly aiding or abetting another person to make an incorrect tax return. However, in the case of third parties generally, the standard of evidence required to incriminate them for an alleged wrongdoing by a taxpayer who has failed to declare correct income or gains is very difficult to meet. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that while, in their experience, aiding and abetting offences are notoriously difficult to prosecute, it would be their general policy to pursue such cases if such evidence became available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>When this tax amnesty was introduced in 1993 the Minister for Finance of the day, who is now the Taoiseach, said he looked forward to the day when tax cheats would be jailed. We heard absolute guarantees that people who availed of the amnesty and were subsequently found to be in breach of it would face the rigours of the law and be pursued to the ends of the earth until they were captured. The inspector of taxes refused two thirds of the 20 people whom the Revenue Commissioners had pursued to establish what they had submitted under the amnesty. Does that not make a laugh of the amnesty provisions passed? Furthermore, can the Minister say why this should be so given the so-called guarantees given at that time and the very stringent penalties for people who availed of the amnesty and did not come clean then? It seems that if someone makes a voluntary declaration Revenue does not even bother to pursue the powers given to it under that amnesty to pursue those people. Hence my previous question asking how many people had been prosecuted under the different sections of that amnesty legislation.</P>
        <P>However, the Minister did not answer that question. He ignored it and gave a global answer to ten questions instead. Will the Minister tell us why people are not being pursued? Why does he now say he will continue to pursue them? Is there a ten-year statute of limitations built into the <Col N="16"/>legislation which prevents the Minister from pursuing people who availed of the amnesty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained in my reply, the level of proof required to obtain a successful conviction under section 9 of the amnesty is evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It has not proved feasible to hear evidence of the standard required to obtain such a conviction. The burden of proof in criminal cases is of the highest standard, that is, beyond reasonable doubt. As regards other aspects of offences where people are convicted, I am sure the Deputy would expect that to be applied by the court. The same applies to criminal prosecutions in tax offences. The tax amnesty legislation in 1993 included an assurance of confidentiality for people dealing with the special collectors. That was enshrined in section 7 of that legislation. As the Revenue auditor or investigator is not permitted access to the declaration made by the person availing of the amnesty, it is not possible to determine whether he or she has been in breach of the amnesty. There are certain exceptions, as the Deputy pointed out, subject to the right of appeal to the appeal commissioners. Less than one third of approximately 20 appeal cases were successful in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the question the Deputy asked about this matter, I have seen some newspaper coverage about the ten-year rule. I have been told by the Revenue Commissioners that the legal advice available to them is that there is no time limit on an investigation of indictable offences. The Revenue investigators proceed on that basis. The effect of the passage of time can create evidential difficulties. Until the mid-1990s the Revenue Commissioners did not pursue a specific prosecution strategy. That was left to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That way of doing things was only changed in the mid-1990s.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners got large amounts of money in all the recent investigations. I refer the Deputy to the final report of the sub-committee on DIRT of the Committee of Public Accounts, which referred to the general approach of Revenue in dealing with the role of financial institutions and it was noted that by then the Revenue Commissioners had taken a pragmatic approach.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>if a survey has been carried out generally to establish the number of public servants willing to transfer to new locations under his decentralisation proposals; if the move will be voluntary and if no public servant will suffer in regard to career options or promotional opportunities if they do not wish to move to a new location; if an assessment has been made of the potential total cost of the decentralisation programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4831/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not undertaken a survey of civil servants or public servants to ascertain the numbers who wish to transfer to each of the locations included in the decentralisation programme. Conducting such a survey in advance of clearer time lines for the sequencing of all the various moves would be of limited value. The decentralisation programme will operate on a voluntary basis. Civil and public servants who do not wish to transfer to a decentralised location will be assigned to alternative posts in Dublin. <Col N="18"/>The exact procedures which will apply will be dealt with as part of the implementation process, which is being driven by the implementation committee and will be discussed with the public service unions.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation will change the way in which the public service operates in the future. In the case of promotion prospects, there will continue to be, broadly speaking, the same opportunities across the Civil Service and public service. The new programme will create a wider range of work and career opportunities for individuals working outside Dublin than is currently the case. Public servants who aspire to senior management positions will no longer have to migrate to the capital, although many may continue to do so. Similarly, individuals serving in Dublin will be able to pursue their careers within Dublin, but many may choose to avail of promotion opportunities in decentralised offices.</P>
        <P>As regards the cost, the Deputy will be aware that rented offices in Dublin are significantly more expensive than those available outside the capital. By vacating existing leased or State-owned property in Dublin, the costs of new accommodation in the regions can be minimised. The programme will operate on a voluntary basis and, therefore, neither removal expenses nor redundancy will be paid. Some additional costs may arise under headings such as travel and subsistence, staff training and technology. The wider economic benefits, particularly better use of regional infrastructure and reduced demand on infrastructure in Dublin, must also be taken into account. I am confident this programme will serve as a catalyst for further economic benefit in provincial Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the Minister's statement about clearer time lines for the sequencing of moves and transfers out of Dublin, is that coded language for saying that the decentralisation programme will take longer than the three years advertised in the budget? What are the clearer time lines? Is the Minister talking about the ten year period which has frequently been described as the time required? Is he aware of surveys carried out in a number of Departments that indicate that only approximately 7% to 10% of civil servants in F&Aacute;S, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments are willing to move out of Dublin? If those surveys are representative or if the Minister wants to challenge them, will he carry out independent surveys? However, if those surveys are a correct reflection of attitudes to decentralisation, will the taxpayer have to foot the bill for the hundreds of civil servants who will be left in Dublin with no clear function? What will the Minister do with those civil servants? Will there be penalties if people fail to transfer? I draw the Minister's attention to the recent advertisement for a senior post in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="19"/>which stated that the applicant must be willing to serve outside Dublin. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The time line to complete this programme is 31 December 2006 and I hope that will be met. We chose that date to put pressure on Ministers and Departments to ensure it is done before a certain event occurs in the summer of 2007. I make no apologies for saying that, it will put pressure on Ministers and politicians to ensure it is delivered.</P>
        <P>I am aware of newspaper speculation about some surveys of limited numbers of staff in various organisations. It is not my intention to ask the Department of Finance to conduct a staff survey. It took four years to make this decision and we will ensure it happens.</P>
        <P>The attitude of some people and commentators since we made the decision is totally at variance with what they said four years prior to the decision, when they were of the view that we would not make the decision, but if we did it would be good. Now that we have made the decision, they are saying it will not succeed and we should not have made it. It is a case of having one's cake and eating it.</P>
        <P>As regards Dublin civil servants, there will still be plenty of public servants post-decentralisation in the Dublin region. There will be a large number of civil and public servants in the Dublin region and there will be ample work for them to do. As regards the recent advertisement for a vacancy in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that was the proper and correct thing to do. Anyone now aspiring to higher posts in the Civil Service will have to be aware that eight of the Departments will move outside Dublin and that a large number of public and civil servants will be based outside Dublin. People should be under no illusion of their responsibilities after our decision last December on decentralisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is aware, St. Valentine's Day has just passed. Does the Minister have any consideration for a couple, both of whom are civil servants, who may have two children with child care costs of between &euro;800 and &euro;1,200 per month? One may be moved to Killarney with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the other to Wexford with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Will the Minister take into account the impact on families in circumstances such as these? The T&aacute;naiste has spoken of the need for the Government to have family-friendly policies. What will happen to the civil servants who refuse to move for family or other reasons, especially in cases where they provide specific technical expertise, as do many of those in F&Aacute;S? How will jobs be found for such people? They cannot all transfer into watching contracts in the <Col N="20"/>Office of Public Works for the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.</P>

	<P>How does the Minister propose to deal with these issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with other Ministers, I have repeatedly said this is a voluntary programme. Given that and with the wide decentralisation, it will be possible to meet most people's requirements. Under this programme, full Departments are moving to provincial locations. The map of Ireland after decentralisation will show large clusters of public and civil servants in various regions. It will therefore be possible for people to transfer both within their own Department and to other Departments. While it may not suit everybody to go to the new location of their office or Department, they can transfer to another Department in the region of their choice. The same will apply to the offices in Dublin. It should be possible to accommodate the wishes of everybody. As this is a voluntary programme every endeavour will be made to accommodate every public servant as best we can.</P>

        <Quest>if the amendments contained in section 13 of the Finance Act 2002 were drafted in response to requests from Eircom ESOT for retrospective changes to the tax treatment of the income and capital gains from the preference share offering that the Valentia consortium issued to help secure the takeover of the company; and the estimate of the revenue forgone by the State from tax on income or capital gained from these Eircom preference shares due to the amendment.</Quest>
        <QRef>[5052/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13 of Finance Act 2002 provides that the transfer and appropriation of securities other than ordinary shares to the beneficiaries of an employee share ownership trust, ESOT, or approved profit sharing scheme, APSS, in the circumstances of certain takeovers may take place in a manner which preserves the tax benefits to the participants. The point at which income tax is forgone is when the shares are passed into the ESOT, which in the case of Eircom took place in 1999, and does not arise from any amendments contained in section 13.</P>
        <P>In June 2001, the tax advisers to the ESOT contacted officials in the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to discuss the tax implications for the Eircom ESOT of the proposed takeover of Eircom. Having considered the issues involved, I indicated in June 2001 that I was prepared to propose an amendment, which I duly did in the Finance Act 2002. This was made <Col N="21"/>known in my response to a parliamentary question from the then Deputy and now Senator Derek McDowell on 14 November 2001 on this subject.</P>
        <P>Had the change not been made, the ESOT would have had to distribute cash to the beneficiaries as the ESOT would not have been permitted to acquire the preference shares, giving rise to a claw-back of some of the income tax forgone in 1999. However, this revenue would only have arisen had the takeover proceeded.</P>
        <P>The legislative changes simply provided the membership of the Eircom ESOT with a level playing field to choose to support whichever bid they wished to support. In the event, two takeovers were in a position to take immediate advantage of these legislative changes. The first was the takeover of the landline business of Eircom by the Valentia consortium and the second was the takeover of ACC Bank by Rabobank.</P>
        <P>I have made numerous changes to the ESOT legislation to facilitate ESOTs in changing circumstances to ensure that they retain the benefits available to them. This is because, by their nature, ESOTs are tailor-made to each particular circumstance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I take issue with the Minister for Finance, who seems to accept that it is in order for the State to involve itself, through changes in the tax code, in sweetening deals in the commercial sector between private entities. To what extent was the public interest served by these changes? It seems the only beneficiaries, apart from the individual shareholders, was the Valentia consortium which subsequently had the benefit of selling on a huge asset having been subsidised through two sales of Eircom. The treatment of shareholders within the ESOT must be contrasted with the 550,000 ordinary Eircom shareholders who were forced to sell their shares at a much-reduced price because of the mechanism the Minister introduced allowing the second sale to the Valentia consortium to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Every Finance Act since 1997 has included some changes to employee share ownership plans, all of which have been done at the request of the ESOTs which comprise the workers involved and their representatives. Even this year's Finance Bill contains a change to ESOP legislation to accommodate the employees of the former Irish National Petroleum Corporation. The change did not have the effect of favouring one consortium over the other as mentioned by the Deputy. Had I not made this change, I would have been accused of favouring the Denis O'Brien consortium. This change was requested by the Eircom ESOT to level the playing field.</P>
        <P>I understand the Eircom ESOT was more inclined to vote for the Valentia consortium which favoured preference shares being offered. <Col N="22"/>If it could not have done that, a tax liability would have been triggered for those represented by the ESOT. In no way would the ESOT have recommended that bid. If this change had not been made, it would have favoured the Denis O'Brien consortium and the Deputy can imagine the hullabaloo that would have caused.</P>
        <P>This provision was contained in the Finance Bill 2002 as published and was covered in the explanatory memorandum. It was debated on Committee Stage and there was no secret about it. After the decision was made in June 2001, the Department of Finance received a request under the Freedom of Information Act, to which it decided to accede in September 2001. In September 2001, a third party objected to the release of information and there was an appeal to the Information Commissioner, on which the commissioner made a decision to release in September 2003. There was nothing underhand about this matter. The changes under section 13 of the Finance Act 2002 requested by representatives of the workers were to preserve the tax benefits of the existing ESOT. These changes were non-discriminatory and affected other takeovers such as the takeover of the ACC Bank by Rabobank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has still not answered the question as to how the public interest or long-term communications policy was served. Why was this section discussed in private session on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2002? If the Minister was confident with this provision, why did the committee feel the need to go into private session? Was this decision the Minister's alone or did he consult the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste or the then Minister for Public Enterprise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, that was done at the request of the former Deputy and now Senator Derek McDowell. It was done to explain the intricacies of the provision and specifically to explain that the matter was the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act, which had been appealed. The Deputy can ask Senator McDowell and others who were present to outline what I said about the amendment at the time. I said I could not believe I had become so socialist in my old age that I was giving in to all the requests affecting ESOTs. I took an opposite view to that which people are now trying to imply. There was noting secret or underhand about this.</P>

	<P>This change was made to benefit the employees represented by the ESOT, and all the changes that have been made to legislation affecting ESOTs through the years since Deputy Quinn first introduced ESOT legislation in the Finance Act 1997 have all been done at the request of the workers to preserve <Col N="23"/>the tax benefits for them alone. Nobody from Valentia or the other consortium made any contact &mdash; good, bad, or indifferent &mdash; with the Department of Finance or me. This was all dealt with between the advisers to the ESOT and the Department and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

        <Quest>the timescale for the decisions on emissions trading and carbon tax; his plans to avoid adverse impacts on competitiveness and a maximum reduction in carbon emissions associated with these schemes; and his views on the approach of ring-fencing revenue from this tax for the purposes such as reducing employment taxes, compensating those on low incomes and promoting low emission technologies and practices.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, following my Budget Statement regarding carbon energy taxation last December, I published a carbon energy tax consultation paper prepared by my Department on 31 July last year. This consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received in my Department by 30 September 2003 but extra time was given where requested by organisations to complete their submissions. Some 117 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper.</P>
        <P>As one might expect, the views in the submissions are divided in terms of support for or concerns about the implications of such a tax. The submissions raise diverse concerns such as competitiveness, the impact on employment, the less well-off and rural areas, cross-Border aspects, the scope of the tax, the link with emissions trading, the role of negotiated agreements and alternative energy and the need for revenue recycling and how that should be applied. All relevant issues, therefore, including the effect of carbon energy tax on competitiveness, the question of ring-fencing revenues, the impact on those with low incomes and the promotion of more efficient technologies will be taken into account in the consideration of the proposal. As part of the consultation process, these submissions are now also available publicly on my Department's website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that the Cabinet has already approved the emissions trading aspect of the carbon tax? Is it the case that under the approved system of emissions trading, those responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions will not need to alter their operations significantly over the coming years? Will it be the case, therefore, that small business will be obliged <Col N="24"/>to pay the carbon tax while the larger operators will not?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that this carbon tax could raise up to &euro;500 million, according to his own policy paper, and that this will be paid predominantly by poorer families? The typical family on the minimum wage spends 15% of its income on fuel &mdash; about &euro;40 per week. If they are using peat and coal, the most polluting fuels, they face a &euro;10 per week increase in fuel costs. What does the Minister propose to do about the implications for different types of business, as envisaged in his proposal, and the implications for families who are struggling to make ends meet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation of quotas for emissions trading is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. On 5 February this year the Minister made announcements in this regard. It was envisaged in the consultation paper that those covered by emissions trading would not also be subject to the carbon energy tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Precisely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that is what will happen, only that it is envisaged in the consultation paper. The matter of emissions trading has been raised recently by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. He is doing this now because we are required under EU law to have our submissions on emissions trading with the Commission before 31 March this year. Other countries are doing the same thing; Ireland is the second country whose Government has made an announcement on this matter. As I said, it was envisaged in the consultation paper that those covered by emissions trading would not also be subject to the proposed carbon energy tax.</P>
        <P>What will happen with the carbon energy tax depends on the assumptions one makes about the level of tax per tonne. I announced in the budget of December 2002 that we would consider the introduction of a carbon energy tax by the end of 2004. The consultation process in which we have engaged has resulted in a large number of submissions, which we recently published on the Department's website. Roughly 49% of the submissions are in favour of the tax while 51% are against, although some people are in the middle. I am glad the Deputy mentioned some of the reasons for caution in this regard. If he feels strongly about these matters he should speak to some of his colleagues in his own party &mdash; although not many &mdash; and his colleagues directly behind him. These are some of the considerations that must be borne in mind before the Government can make a decision. Those who take a simplistic view ignore some of the matters to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>These decisions will intimately affect people's lives, whether one is poor or is in a business that will be affected. The Minister is saying he will effectively give large companies free trades. They will have coupons which cover 97% of their prospective uses. They will make virtually no adaptation to reduce energy emissions. Is he not proposing a carbon tax that will hit small business and ordinary households, forcing them to make all the reductions in carbon emissions?</P>
        <P>I would like to hear the Minister take a view on this. Why does he not publish a White Paper so there can be a serious debate on the options the Government is considering adopting? The Minister is asking what the Labour Party thinks, what the Green Party thinks and what Fine Gael thinks. That is not what he was appointed to do. He is the Minister; he should be leading the way. He should issue proposals and allow people to react to them and tease out the issues before they are finally adopted.</P>

It was envisaged that those covered by the emissions trading regime would not be subject to carbon energy tax. The questions the Deputy raised about the carbon energy tax are all dealt with in the published document and referred to in the consultation process. They will be taken account of.

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>if he will intervene with insurance companies to ensure that flood cover is provided to householders in areas where remedial measures have been taken to prevent renewed flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4978/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to intervene with insurance companies about the level of premiums or any risks it is willing or unwilling to underwrite. The appropriate regulatory body for the industry is the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. In November 2002 I initiated a major review of the State's approach to flooding with the primary objective of developing a cohesive national flooding policy. I met with the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, on 6 December 2002. The IIF welcomed my decision to initiate the review of policy and outlined its views and concerns about the increasing risks from flooding. I indicated that the State would play its part in risk reduction and that the insurance industry would in turn be expected to act in a responsible manner.</P>
        <P>I invited the IIF to make a submission to the review group which I established to carry out the policy review. A submission was received and OPW officials subsequently met with the IIF to clarify certain aspects of that submission. These discussions, along with all others involved in the consultation process carried out as part of the policy review, have contributed to the work of the review group. Its report is currently being considered by Departments before being submitted to Government in the near future. I am confident that the recommendations of the report can lead to a much improved flood management regime in Ireland and will in the long term substantially mitigate the impact of flooding on our society.</P>
        <P>One of the key components of future flood management strategy is the development of flood maps. These provide valuable information to assist in numerous decision-making processes such as planning and development, flood works prioritisation and assessment of risk. The OPW has commenced work on a flood mapping programme, the first phase of which will be completed in 2005. I remain confident that the increased availability of flood information arising from the production of flood hazard maps and implementation of the other recommendations contained within the report of the policy review group, will reduce exposure to risk from flooding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, met with the Irish Insurance Federation and indicated that the industry would be expected to act in a responsible manner, does he believe it <Col N="27"/>has so responded? Is he aware that in areas where the State on behalf of taxpayers has spent large amounts of money on well thought-out and planned anti-flooding measures &mdash; I do not wish to add to the stigma or problems of residents by naming the areas &mdash; insurance companies continue to double premia, to place a loading in excess of &euro;5,000 for flood cover and to refuse cover to those who move into the area, in effect, preventing residents selling houses as without insurance cover, one cannot get a mortgage? Is the Irish Insurance Federation behaving in a responsible manner when it effectively, making no secret of it, blacklists specific areas? Representatives of residents' associations in these areas meeting with individual insurance companies seem to have more success than the Minister of State and the Department in getting the insurance companies to respond responsibly.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State believe the insurance industry in behaving as I have outlined is acting responsibly? If not, in areas where the State has worked effectively to prevent future flooding, will the Minister of State ensure the insurance companies behave responsibly and provide insurance at a reasonable price?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>My remit extends to the OPW and as the Deputy rightly stated, the OPW has completed a programme of substantial works in that area, mitigating the flood risk substantially. Under the new plan, Dublin City Council has applied to the OPW for further funds to carry out additional work which will mitigate the flood risk. It is not within my remit to intervene with insurance companies as to how the insurance premia are set. That is for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority but I assume, as I stated in my reply, it would be expected to act in a responsible manner. The IIF was invited to make a submission to the flood review group which it did. In its final report that will go to Government shortly, the flood review group has taken on board many of the IIF suggestions and recommendations. In the light of that and further works, I can see no reason that it should not respond in a favourable manner, but it is outside my remit to force it to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has met with the Irish Insurance Federation in advance of the works being carried out. Will he meet it again to discuss the IIF's response to the works, to ensure that it responds positively, having reflected on the points raised by the Minister of State at the previous meeting, by providing insurance cover to residents?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly, if that were to help the situation. The flood review group report is to be submitted to Government and I hope it will be adopted by Government shortly. Following that, <Col N="28"/>I have no difficulty outlining to the IIF and making a case for the measures to be put in place. My officials and I met with the IIF, one of the approximately 100 interested parties that made recommendations across all Departments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has concluded his meetings with the chief executives representing ten financial institutions. All financial institutions have advised that they would be co-operating with Revenue's proposed investigation into offshore accounts. The formal investigation is commencing on 29 March 2004.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this investigation will initially involve ten financial institutions with subsidiaries or branches in offshore locations, including Northern Ireland. The investigation will be intensive and Revenue will seek to use all its available powers to identify Irish residents who hold or have held offshore accounts or investments. This House will be aware that I gave extensive powers to the commissioners in 1999 which enables them to obtain information on a class of persons where the individual identities were previously unknown. I am also proposing in section 84 of the Finance Bill 2004 to extend Revenue's powers regarding information held by a controlled foreign entity of a financial institution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the ten financial institutions to which the Minister referred, he stated in 2003 that three financial institutions had been dealt and clearly the Revenue has met a further five institutions. Does that mean that the Revenue has now concluded settlements with those institutions and their directors on the activities of the subsidiary operations of Irish financial institutions, not in this jurisdiction? If so, has the <Col N="29"/>Minister an estimate of the further tax and penalties that he expects to collect as a consequence of these investigations? Are the directors of these financial institutions secure from further prosecution or penalty by the Revenue Commissioners? Is it the Minister's intention to pursue the directors of financial institutions which may have been in default? I referred previously to the pubic statements by Mr. Fitzpatrick, formerly of Anglo Irish Bank, on the banks coming together to meet with the Revenue Commissioners on these matters. Did the financial institutions meet both individually and collectively, as suggested by Mr. Fitzpatrick in 2003?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has met with the chief executives on an individual basis. All the relevant financial institutions advise the Revenue that they will be co-operating with the proposed investigation into offshore accounts. The formal investigation will commence on 29 March 2004. In the meantime, I understand that the banks, as previously, will write to their customers advising them that this investigation will take place and of the benefits of voluntary disclosure. Hopefully, that will lead to an expeditious investigation of these matters.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I do not have an estimate of the amount that possibly will be collected in this regard. Of course, this is totally dependent on the amount of evasion. As the Deputy will know, not all the money held in offshore accounts relates to tax evasion as there are many good reasons to have offshore accounts. However, these matters will only come to light post-investigation. I have included section 84 in the Finance Bill 2004 to copperfasten the legal position regarding the investigation into these matters. There was some doubt as to whether the Revenue Commissioners would have real power to deal with offshore operations where money was not channelled through an Irish account. I also did it to satisfy the banks that they were correct to give information in this regard.</P>
        <P>The question of further investigations or possible prosecutions is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners following their investigations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister seen any <i>prima facie</i> evidence that financial institutions were facilitating tax evasion and that there was an element of collusion in respect of the use of some of these offshore accounts or does he believe that the institutions had legitimate grounds for believing that all this money was for legitimate purposes and that they were only providing a service which they believed to be legitimate? What does the Minister believe to be the legitimate reasons for these substantial amounts of money &mdash; a sum of &euro;100 million has been recovered in the case of just one of these institutions to date &mdash; and transactions on that scale being offshore?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="30"/>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not, and would not, have evidence of how the Revenue Commissioners will deal with these matters. That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and evidence is not supplied to me as to the legitimacy or otherwise of the cases. The information will come out when the Revenue Commissioners are investigating these matters.</P>
        <P>There are many reasons for having offshore accounts. People have them for legitimate business reasons. Many ex-pats who work abroad on contracts and so forth often use these accounts for a variety of reasons and continue to maintain them when they return to Ireland. However, this will become clear when the Revenue Commissioners conclude their investigation and produce a report on the matter. They also produce annual reports and are interrogated by the press. When the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners comes before the relevant committee of the House, he may be asked further questions. At present, my concern is to get these investigations started. The more money that is collected for the Exchequer, the better for everybody.</P>

	<P>Is it intended to extend the Revenue Commissioners' investigations to other financial institutions not already included in the list of ten? What about other companies which are not recognised financial institutions, for example, the CRH situation? Is the Minister concerned that illicit banking activity might be taking place in other non-financial institution companies that would warrant the Revenue Commissioners' attention? What steps have the Minister and the Department taken since that situation was revealed to ensure such activity is stopped?</P>

	<P>Tax evasion is, and always has been, an activity in which people should not engage. I have done more than any other Minister for Finance to give powers to the Revenue Commissioners to pursue tax evasion. If the Deputy checks the legislation over the past 60 years, she will discover that more power has been given to the Revenue Commissioners by me to investigate tax evasion than any previous Minister or a combination of five Ministers for Finance. I utterly condemn tax evasion and have taken practical steps to eliminate it as far as possible.</P>

        <Quest>the investigation which has been held into the circumstances in which contracts worth over &euro;800,000 were awarded by the Office of Public Works to a company (details supplied) whose managing director was a business associate of an OPW official; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4764/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is currently being examined independently on behalf of the Office of Public Works. The purpose of the examination is to establish, in so far as possible, the facts in the matter. I expect the results of the examination to be available shortly.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage nor would it be correct for me to comment on the specifics of the situation pending the completion of the examination. However, I wish to clarify one point. The figure of &euro;800,000 refers to the total value of payments to the company in question over a nine year period from 1995 to date. During this period the OPW kept under regular review the prices being charged in the market for the services in question and was satisfied that it was availing of the most cost-effective service.</P>
        <P>It is obviously a matter of concern that any suggestion of impropriety should attach to the award of public contracts by the OPW or by any Department or agency. The OPW, through the activities of its various business units, including the Government Supplies Agency, plays a significant role in the procurement of property, <Col N="32"/>construction and other goods and services on behalf of Departments and agencies. Due to the central role it plays in the procurement area, the OPW has consistently strived to ensure that it conforms to the highest possible standards of fairness, transparency, integrity and value in awarding public contracts. I believe it achieves this objective across the broad range of its services.</P>
        <P>It is the general policy of the OPW that all procurement activity in the organisation abides by the principles and rules set out in the national public procurement guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and in the EU public procurement directives. In essence, this means that contracts for the supply of goods and services should be awarded by way of competitive tender where practicable. There is also an obligation on all personnel involved in the tendering process to ensure that any potential conflict of interest in that process is disclosed in good time.</P>
        <P>When the results of the independent examination become available, I will consider them carefully and take whatever steps I consider appropriate in the circumstances. My sole objective will be to ensure that the integrity of the procurement process in the OPW is maintained to its current high standards and strengthened where necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is carrying out this independent investigation, examination or inquiry? The Minister spoke of an independent examination. What are its terms of reference and will the Minister put them in the public domain? The Minister must be aware that the award of contracts with regard to certain elements of audio visual supplies in the OPW, amounting to more than &euro;800,000, has been the cause of serious public disquiet. Is any member of the staff of the OPW subject to the terms of this inquiry, given that a member of the OPW staff is reported to have or to have had a business relationship with the managing director of a company which received contracts worth more than &euro;800,000 in total between 1997 and 2003?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The company carrying out the independent investigation is a well-known management consultancy auditor &mdash; PricewaterhouseCoopers &mdash; and I expect it will bring forward the report within weeks. In this instance we are talking about the provision of audio technical services in Dublin Castle which is one of our foremost high quality conference centres and is used intensively by both Government and outside agencies. In this situation the services of these audio technicians might be required on up to ten occasions per week and therefore the situation would not require the issuing of a formal tender on every occasion. It has been the case that these services are generally provided on an hourly rate. In this case a number of firms are involved and the overall spend is spread over these. The conditions <Col N="33"/>are reviewed on a regular basis and we deem the prices that we pay to this firm and the others to be reasonable and above question.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the named individual, that official is not currently involved in the procurement of services from the company concerned. Steps are being taken to ensure that the supply of all goods and services will be subject to a formal, fair and transparent competitive tendering process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to hear that. Will the Minister of State answer my question about the terms of reference of this examination or inquiry? Is he saying that this official has been moved aside while the inquiries are under way? I draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that there is serious concern, particularly among the businesses to which the Minister of State refers, that a number of contracts are not advertised in the official journal of the EU. Under EU public procurement rules if a contract is in excess of &euro;162,000, it must be advertised in the official journal of the European Commission. However, the value of many contracts start off at approximately &euro;21,000 and climb to way over the tender limit. How does the Minister of State propose to address these matters? Is the Minister aware of the serious disquiet among other tenderers for Government business about how the OPW has done its business in this respect?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will. They are lengthy and, obviously, all the issues will be investigated. First, on the matter of tenders and limits, I accept there is an issue of whether something is a structure. In this case the issue was the provision of tents and marquees to provide emergency accommodation for the press attending and the definition of a new sprung structure, with which I was not familiar, which would be regarded as a building and what is in effect a marquee. Any of us who have been inside some of these expensive marquees lately would find it hard to tell whether they were a structure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy is interested in an explanation, I will strive to give one. Perhaps in <Col N="34"/>this case a false assessment was made as to what was a works tender, which would allow a &euro;5 million ceiling, and what was a services tender, which would allow a ceiling of &euro;154,000. Obviously, the report will come forward with some explanation of that issue.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference are to assess the procedures applied to the procurement of audio-visual services from this particular company; to assess the procedures applied to the procurement of audio-visual and translation equipment and services for the 2004 EU Presidency; to assess the risks associated with the procurement of other goods and services within Dublin Castle and to evaluate the underlying procedures and controls; to make recommendations on improvements to procedures for the procurement in Dublin Castle to ensure they are conducted in a fully transparent and fair manner and that adequate procedures and controls are in place to safeguard the integrity of the procurement process; to document the outside business interests and relationships, including directorships, of the individual and to consider the extent to which these may have represented a conflict of interest with regard to procurement of audio-visual services having regard to national and EU procurement regulations. The terms are definitive. I await the outcome of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year I had the opportunity to meet the relatives of the victims of the Omagh bomb. This was one of the most sobering meetings I have ever attended. Over two hours, people made their case cogently that what they are in pursuit of is the truth. Why, the day before we debate the Nally report in the D&aacute;il, has a visit to Omagh been arranged suddenly for the Taoiseach? Is this just a cynical exercise by the Taoiseach for a photo opportunity? Would he not have been far better employed to stay in Government Buildings, meet the families of the victims of the Omagh bomb and atrocity and give them a briefing on elements of the Nally report which he could discuss with them? Perhaps, as was discussed in the House, he could give them an edited version of that report without interfering or infringing upon State security.</P>
      <P>It appears to me and to the public at large that in the Taoiseach's reply to a parliamentary question some weeks ago concerning visits outside his jurisdiction, this visit was not mentioned. When was this visit arranged and what is the purpose of the visit? Why did the Taoiseach not take the preferred path of meeting the families of the victims in Dublin, where they will happen to be on that day? On the day before the D&aacute;il debates the Nally report, why is it not possible to give an edited version of the report to the families who time and again have said that what they want from this is the simple truth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will visit Northern Ireland on Thursday, as I do regularly. I have a number of engagements which have been arranged for some time. I will be in Coleraine University, Derry and Belfast to discuss the Belfast partnership and a number of other issues. One of the engagements I have is in Omagh.</P>
      <P>The Nally report was to be debated by the House last Friday so had that gone ahead it <Col N="36"/>would have been completed before my visit. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on previous occasions, made the committee aware of the issues in so far as he has been able to do so. Over the years I have met many of the people connected with Omagh. I have been involved in many of their fundraising efforts and have kept in touch with them. I will participate in a reception by the leaders of the civic society and councils in Omagh.</P>
      <P>When talking about international visits abroad in the context of the EU, I do not include Northern Ireland, or perhaps I included the fact that I would be in Northern Ireland a number of times between now and the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the time the Taoiseach has spent over the past number of years dealing with the Good Friday Agreement and the attempts to bring about a peaceful solution to the problems of Northern Ireland and cross-Border activities.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm if he is to meet with the families of the victims of the Omagh bomb in Dublin, at an appropriate time convenient to him? Will he consent to giving the families of the victims a briefing on the essential elements of the Nally report that do not infringe State security? Will he further undertake to give the families an appropriate edited version of the Nally report which they can peruse?</P>
      <P>In so doing, does the Taoiseach not consider that he would be far more genuine towards the plight of the families and their quest for truth than the perception that will emanate from a visit to Omagh for a photo opportunity without meeting the families of victims to explain what he can to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether or not there are photographers in Omagh is a matter for the photographers. Needless to say, I could not care less. I met representatives of the Omagh groups as far back as 22 August 1998 and continue to do so.</P>
      <P>As far as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or me for that matter, being able to brief people on facts and information regarding the Nally report &mdash; although it is appropriate that the Minister would undertake this &mdash; I assure Deputy Kenny that in so far as it is legally watertight to give that information, I have no difficulty in doing that. That would be a good thing.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, if we could give the whole report it would resolve many issues for them as well because a lot of things being said about the Nally report have to do with people clutching on to things where they believe there might be something in it, but as we both know, there is no such information in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the recommendations in the DIRT report was that dormant accounts in financial institutions ought to be transferred to <Col N="37"/>the Exchequer to be administered for socially beneficial purposes. This recommendation was taken on board by the Minister for Finance in the 2001 Act when he provided for the establishment of an independent board that would disburse this money in accordance with stated objectives to assist people who are socially, educationally and economically disadvantaged, including people with disabilities. The board was duly appointed and statutory provision was made to permit the Minister to direct and issue guidelines.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, after the D&aacute;il closed for the Christmas recess, a couple of days before Christmas, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, issued a statement saying that he would take over the administration of this fund of in excess of &euro;100 million.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach justify the Minister intervening to use these moneys, which were not the State's moneys, as a further political slush fund in the way that the lottery funds have been disbursed down the years? When will this legislation promised by the Minister on 19 December be brought before the House? No doubt it will be in time for the local elections.</P>
      <P>These were moneys taken over from the financial institutions from the funds of people with dormant accounts. They were meant to be used for socially beneficial reasons in disadvantaged communities. Now we find that having appointed the board, the Minister is not happy and will assert his right to disburse these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the legislation have been approved, but I am not sure when the Bill will be before the House. The plan for the dormant accounts board was published in early November and, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, it was to be used for those affected by economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability. These were the three categories highlighted in that plan from last November. The plan was to create a framework within which the board would disburse the resources. If I recall correctly, the original figure was quite small and the figure that came forward in that plan was somewhere in the order of &euro;30 million, just short of it or just over it. The plan was to provide for levels of disbursement particularly for ring-fenced areas. A number of categories were highlighted where there were already programmes for the disadvantaged. The board remains in place as an advisory board.</P>
      <P>At the last Government meeting at Christmas time, we said we would review the arrangements to make sure the projects would be evaluated, that we would look at the additional resources, would continue to have the board advise and prioritise, that its recommendations would be considered by Government and that there would be a disbursement plan.</P>

	<P>Can we have a translation of that please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to ensure that there is maximum transparency of disbursements, the Government's view was that the objectives of disbursements should remain unchanged, that we would make decisions on disbursements and that the Government would have an involvement in that.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons for that was that an applicant or organisation could apply under half a dozen different categories under half a dozen different Votes, if there was not any way of bringing them together. One would not be able to do that transparently.</P>
      <P>The board will still evaluate the applications and it will still act in an advisory capacity. To do that requires legislation and the legislation will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an entirely disingenuous reply by the Taoiseach. He took me through a description of the process. We know what it is; the question is why the Minister felt it necessary to abrogate his legislation and promise amending legislation so he can get his hands on the money.</P>
      <P>It is blatantly disingenuous to imply that an applicant might rip-off the system by applying under six different headings and that the Cabinet will be able to sort this out. The fact of the matter is that is why the independent board was established. That is why the independent board was going to make decisions on what projects should or should not be assisted. It is a blatant political gimmick to get their hands on this money for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Whatever one associates with the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, it is not transparency. I never understood any answer he gave me on any controversial issue. The most disgraceful and dishonest act of this Government was the commitment that the Taoiseach made in advance of the last general election that 2 billion would be transferred under the RAPID programme to areas of disadvantage and it did not last until the election was over. Some 2 billion was promised to disadvantaged communities and the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, pulled the plug on the entire lot after 5 million had been wasted in agreeing plans that the Taoiseach said would be funded. He is now going to use this as a fig leaf; a disbursement plan, this is a disbursement electoral gimmick and a disgraceful take-over for political purposes of moneys that were not the Government's in the first place.</P>

	<P>The usual suspects, from well paid newspaper editors to even better paid businessmen, have lined up to attack modestly paid bus drivers for organising a four hour protest yesterday for the protection of public transport in this city and country. The Taoiseach, who is not paid too badly in contrast to bus drivers, was, as usual, found among the chorus of condemnation and said there was no logic to their actions. Where is the logic in the compulsive obsession of the Minister for Transport to privatise one quarter of Dublin's bus services? The EU benchmarking report on European public transport found that Dublin Bus operates in the worst traffic of any EU capital, Government subvention to Dublin Bus is among the lowest in the EU, and we have the lowest ratio of drivers to buses in five major EU capitals and the lowest costs per bus. Where is the logic in handing over one quarter of the capital's crucial public transport service, possibly including garages and facilities, to multinational bus companies based in London, Hamburg and elsewhere? Is &euro;20 billion in repatriated profits not enough to be sent from this country annually?</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister for Transport's right-wing economic thinking is driving this and, despite all logic, is driving the Government to accept the privatisation agenda? Does the Taoiseach not think that the public transport services and the bus service in Dublin is best controlled as a fully publicly owned company, democratically organised and run in the interests of the public and with decent conditions for the workers rather than being handed over to unaccountable multinationals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me one question in his contribution: whether I said yesterday that I did not see the logic of the stoppage. I said this. Yesterday's dispute was about the fact that an independent chairman had not been appointed. That is what I passed comment on and that is what the dispute was <Col N="41"/>about. All the other issues the Deputy raised are interesting and I hope they are debated in due course.</P>
      <Miles par="115" com="cl"/><P>The reason I said what I did was because the Minister for Transport met the general secretary of the ICTU and representatives of the CIE unions on 26 January. I was involved in the meetings around this. Arising from that meeting, it was agreed to resume discussions under an independent chairperson. Following this meeting, officials from the Department of Transport were in regular contact with the trade unions regarding the basis for the resumed discussions and the appointment of an independent chairperson, as sought by the unions.</P>
      <P>Following the confirmation from the trade unions on Friday, 30 January that they were prepared to re-enter discussions, the Department of Transport and the Department of the Taoiseach jointly approached the Labour Relations Commission on 3 February seeking the nomination of an independent chairperson. A number of issues regarding the role and selection of the appropriate person who would act as an independent chair caused difficulties for the Labour Relations Commission. This delayed the nomination of the independent chairperson until 13 February &mdash; last Friday &mdash; when Kevin Foley was nominated by the LRC and was accepted by both sides. This was the position when I left my office on Friday last. Even though we had decided to resume talks, the unions decided to proceed with the industrial action. I said that I did not see the logic of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the bus drivers were not out for a stroll yesterday but were expressing the depth of their anger at the privatisation plans of the Minister for Transport? Does the Taoiseach accept that bus drivers, especially those in Dublin, work an extremely difficult, stressful and responsible job where, unfortunately, they are open to aggression and violence? Why does the Taoiseach propose a system that will eventually lead to a worsening of conditions, longer hours and pressure on pay? This is the record of private multinational bus companies. Does the Taoiseach not know that privatisation has been a disaster for workers and the travelling public in parts of Britain, for example?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach check the Napoleonic tendencies of the Minister for Transport regarding crucial areas of the public service? Will transport workers be forced to have an all-out strike before the Minister and the Government returns to logic?</P>

	<P>Napoleon would never have got into the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As with most Members, I would be genuinely concerned about the <Col N="42"/>conditions and future of workers in Dublin Bus and other parts of the transport sector. It is for this reason that we should be honest with them and inform them that, for a number of years, the legal view has been that the 1932 Act will be struck down sooner or later &mdash; as has happened in other areas &mdash; and will open up the transport area to private operators. This is the position and we must tell the truth to transport workers.</P>
      <P>To deal with this, we have been trying for some time to have meaningful discussions and much good work has taken place. Most of the trade union leaders recognise the difficulties and know that progress must be made. I am glad to note that a meeting took place this morning between the CIE unions and the Department of Transport to discuss the arrangements for the resumed talks. It is better that these issues are dealt with; otherwise, it is quite clear what will happen in due course. This is the best way of protecting the rights and conditions of workers for the future.</P>

      <P>Given that the Government is unwilling to take on board the damaging effects of incineration on health, will it consider the voice of UNESCO as well as those of several Unionist politicians who apparently have greater concern for the well-being of the people and property of the Louth-Meath area than the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen?

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I too object to the use of the guillotine in this case. It is impossible to gauge the extent of participation. It is unquestionably an important Bill, but business might very well be concluded within the time. The objection is that a guillotine is once more being applied. In the event that not all speakers have had a chance to participate, it rules out people in the queue. It is not acceptable, yet it has now become the practice since the resumption of this session. It is most objectionable, and I oppose the proposition.</P>

	<P>I accept that we should try to avoid guillotining any Stage, where possible.

	<P>Regarding the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003, in December 2002, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, clearly said that he intended to put an immediate stop to public service recruitment and reduce public service numbers by 5,000 by 2005. It has now emerged that public service numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have gone up by 20,000 in the last year. Is that a cause of concern to the Taoiseach, and is the matter to be addressed in the context of putting the Bill before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Twenty thousand members of the public service have been recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but it is not appropriate to raise that matter on the Order of Business. There are other ways for the Deputy to raise the matter. I call the Taoiseach on the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has already started its passage through the House. There is a difference between the number of people identified in the survey as working as whole-time equivalents. In the report to which Deputy Kenny refers, it is stated that, if one works for over an hour in any capacity, one is classed as a full-time employee. That is not the way to count the public service. There is an enormous difference between the <Col N="45"/>figures from the Department of Finance and those in the survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Having changed his position half a dozen times on whether the introduction of electronic voting in the forthcoming elections could or could not be done by order, has the Taoiseach's Government discovered, at the 12th hour, that it requires primary legislation? When will such legislation be introduced? Will he assure the House that it will not be introduced before electronic voting in the European and local elections, having regard to the shambles and bungling of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, in handling the matter? Regarding the T&aacute;naiste's concerns about there being no verifiable voter audit trail, does the Taoiseach consider that the amendment tabled to the motion tonight in the names of the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Sargent and me meets the crisis that has been unnecessarily provoked by the incompetence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy's first question is in order, but the second would be more appropriate to the debate during Private Members' time tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me several questions, but the first concerned whether we were going to introduce legislation. The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The reason does not concern our changing our minds or position, or any advice that we may have received. The right to vote is one of the fundamental rights of our democracy, and because people raised several related issues, I said last week that we would listen both inside and outside the House. Many articles and people have said that we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach told us that he would not introduce the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy asks me a question, he should let me answer it, for God's sake.</P>

	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach said he was right and Deputy Gilmore was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did say that. There is no constitutional or legal position that says that one has to change the law. However, because the right to vote is fundamental and people, both inside and outside the House, have stated that on this issue we should be careful, &ldquo;treble careful&rdquo;, as it <Col N="46"/>was put in one newspaper, when making any changes, we have listened. We have examined what we can do to bring certainty. The Government understands and agrees with the need to ensure the utmost confidence in the electoral system. Therefore, in response to the concerns expressed, we have decided to establish an independent panel to verify secrecy and to deal with the issue of an individual who wishes to abstain and how that might be highlighted. It means changing the equipment technically, which will be explained later tonight, as well as dealing with the tallying information. Those were the issues raised. We have looked at them and while it is not a necessity to change, we think it would be better to do so to ensure the absolute credibility of the system. It is right that we do that and I hope it is recognised inside and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was whether the Taoiseach will introduce primary legislation and, if so, when we will see it. Given the concerns to which the Taoiseach has now awoken and the absence of provision for the counting systems in the motion the Government has just published, the critical question is whether such legislation will apply for the forthcoming elections.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt><?oasys _cl11.3-?>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative form to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences which were contained in the financial resolution on motor tax passed by <Col N="54"/>the D&aacute;il on 25 November 2003. The resolution and the Bill provide for a standard 5% across the board increase on motor tax on all classes of vehicle. As the House will be aware, the increases in motor tax are already in place and apply to all motor tax taken out for periods from 1 January this year. In making the decision to increase motor tax rates, the primary consideration was the need to provide adequate funding for the non-national roads programme.</P>
      <P>Motor tax is paid directly into the local government fund. The receipts from motor tax are topped up annually by an Exchequer contribution which is increased each year at least in line with inflation by reference to the base year of 1998. In fact, the Exchequer contribution to the fund since its introduction has far exceeded the minimum inflation guarantee in the Local Government Act 1998. The fund is used to finance the general purpose needs of local authorities and to finance non-national roads grants.</P>
      <P>The general purpose grants, which are paid from the fund, are discretionary block grants which can be used by authorities for whatever purpose they consider necessary. In general, they are used to supplement other current income sources such as specific State grants, commercial rates and fees and charges for services. The income from all these sources is incorporated into local authorities' annual budgets to fund a wide range of functions, ranging from management of the planning system, upkeep of social housing, operation and maintenance of public water and sewerage systems, waste management, care of the natural environment, running the fire services, etc.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements introduced by the local government fund, the level of general purpose funding available to local authorities has increased substantially. The extent to which this is so is evidenced by the fact that, since 1997 when the current parties in Government first came to office, the level of general purpose grant aid to local authorities has increased on average by 122%. This represents an average annual increase of some 17% over the past seven years. The 2004 funding package of &euro;752 million is up &euro;92.2 million on last year. In anybody's language, this represents a valuable contribution to local government.</P>
      <P>While it is relevant to make reference to general purpose grants in any discussion on the local government fund, the Bill is essentially concerned with non-national roads. I am aware from previous debates in the House that there is wide agreement regarding the need to invest in our non-national road network to develop the social and economic potential of all regions. The establishment of the local government fund and its substantial funding by motor tax receipts has created an important link between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the visible service they <Col N="55"/>receive for that tax in terms of better roads. It is estimated that the motor tax increases will generate an additional &euro;34 million for the local government fund in 2004. I assure the House that every cent of the extra revenue generated by the increases in rates will be spent on non-national roads. The LGF increase of &euro;34 million in 2004 represents an increase of almost 9% on the 2003 allocation of &euro;394 million.</P>
      <P>The grant allocation for non-national roads in 2004 is &euro;477 million. This is the highest in the history of the State. This allocation is more than double the 1997 expenditure and almost 10% more than last year. I am happy to record that the Government has, for a third consecutive year, maintained the allocations at a record level.</P>
      <P>This &euro;477 million comprises &euro;428 million from the local government fund and &euro;48.8 million from the Exchequer. The 2004 Exchequer allocation shows an increase of around &euro;8.8 million, or<?oasys _jy?> 22%, over the 2003 initial provision. This funding is mainly for key strategic non-national roads projects that will assist housing, commercial and industrial development. The additional funds being provided in 2004 by the Exchequer will enable local authorities to progress work on critically important schemes on the country's regional roads network.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out the Government's expenditure plans for the non-national road network between 2000 and 2006. The plan commits &euro;2.43 billion to the non-national roads programme over the period. Under the plan, &euro;1.08 billion will be spent in the BMW region and &euro;1.35 billion will be spent in the southern and eastern region. Expenditure in both regions between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2003 was well ahead of that profiled for the period in the plan. Expenditure in that period was almost &euro;1.62 billion compared with a profile of &euro;1.41 billion. This represents an increase of almost 15%. Expenditure in the BMW region was almost &euro;690 million compared with a profile of &euro;622 million and expenditure in the southern and eastern region was almost &euro;930 million compared with a profile of &euro;787 million.</P>
      <P>The non-national roads programme is one of the national development plan's major success stories. It continues to be one of the best performing measures under the southern and eastern and BMW regional operational programmes. The success is largely due to the good work of local authorities. This excellent progress has been recognised in the mid-term reviews of the regional operational programmes and in the ESRI's mid-term evaluation of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme continues to be a key part of non-national road grant allocations. Just over &euro;220 million has been allocated for the restoration programme in 2004. This funding will enable local authorities to carry out all schemes <Col N="56"/>included until the end of 2004 from their multi-annual programmes from 2002 to 2005.</P>
      <P>The first pavement condition study of non-national roads, which was carried out in 1996, identified that approximately 47,000 km. of the non-national road network were deficient at that time. The success of the Government's policy in this area can be gauged by the fact that it is estimated that approximately 32,000 km., or 68% of the network deemed as deficient in 1996, had been restored to good condition by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>A company of consulting engineers, RPS-MCOS Limited, was appointed last year to conduct a second pavement condition study of regional and local roads, as well as a review of pavement management systems. This new study is part of the Government's ongoing commitment to restoring the regional and local roads network to a satisfactory condition. The results of the study will determine the progress that has been made since 1996 and the extent of the remaining deficiencies in the non-national road network. The results will form an important part in prioritising investment in the non-national network and ensuring value for money in future years. Following the completion of the study, local authorities will be asked to submit revised multi-annual restoration programmes from 2005 onwards.</P>
      <P>Pavement management systems have not previously been reviewed. The consultants have been asked to review existing systems and to recommend a single system for use by local authorities on the non-national road network. This is intended to assist local authorities in prioritising schemes for inclusion in the restoration programme. Work on the study and review is due to be completed by August of this year.</P>
      <P>I wish to send a strong message to local authorities by stating that the Government's commitment to the non-national roads programme must be matched at local level. It is estimated that local authorities will invest approximately &euro;150 million of their resources on non-national roads in 2004. This investment will bring the total investment this year to &euro;627 million. The House is aware that State grants are intended to supplement the contribution of resources by local authorities, rather than being seen as a substitute for such resources. I expect local authorities to maintain their contribution of resources to non-national roads and to aim for increases at least in line with inflation. My Department will monitor closely this element of the programme this year. It is intended that local authorities which increase expenditure of their own resources will be rewarded.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will agree that huge strides have been made in developing our non-national road infrastructure in recent years. This development has been due, in large part, to the <Col N="57"/>establishment of the local government fund and the assignment of motor tax to that fund. It is obvious that the increases in motor tax rates provided for in this Bill will not be popular, but they will ensure that the progress which has been achieved can be built on in future years. I mentioned that the rates of motor tax set out in the Bill apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for a period beginning on or after 1 January 2004. The new tax rates for all vehicles are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the House what the increase of 5% on all vehicles means, in cash terms, in respect of private cars and goods vehicles, which make up over 90% of the national fleet. The annual rate increase is &euro;7 for the smallest private cars, those under 1,000 cc. The annual increase is between &euro;11 and &euro;13 for private cars of between 1,001 cc. and 1,300 cc. The annual increase is between &euro;14 for private cars between 1,301 cc. and 1,400 cc. Some 60% of the national car fleet is made up of cars under 1,400 cc., therefore, the annual extra cost for most motorists will be between &euro;7 and &euro;14, or between 13 and 27 cent per week. The increases for the remaining cars will range from &euro;15 for cars over 1,400 cc. to &euro;64 for cars over 3,001 cc. Fewer than 0.5% of cars are in the 3,001 cc. plus category.</P>
      <P>The effect of the 5% increase on goods vehicles will vary, depending on the size of the vehicle. Some 85% of vehicles in this category are at the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay an annual increase of &euro;12, or 23 cent per week. A 5% increase is proposed for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of paying tax on such vehicles. While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles. The increase for a pair of trade plates will be &euro;13.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill, which has just six sections, is to give permanent legal standing to the increases in motor tax introduced by a financial resolution passed by the D&aacute;il in November 2003. The increases are being introduced for the sole purpose of funding the national roads programme, to ensure that local authorities can continue the great progress they have made in recent years in rehabilitating our non-national road network. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>My party will oppose this Bill. I will start by quoting from Fianna F&aacute;il's election manifesto of 2002: &ldquo;The surest way to cause unemployment and undermine the public finances would be to implement unsustainable spending plans or to try to return to the days of high taxation.&rdquo; Those of us who fought the 2002 general election against the Government knew that it could not be trusted to keep this promise. We also knew it would saddle the country with <Col N="58"/>higher taxes and unsustainable public spending. Even I am amazed that the Government would subject the country to the dangerous economic forces of both out-of-control public spending and increases in stealth taxes. In this morning's newspapers, there was another example of out-of-control public spending with public sector employment rising again.</P>
      <P>Today, we are debating another increase in taxation through stealth measures, another step in the return to high taxation Ireland. Since the election, the Government has increased taxes 27 times. The taxes imposed range from credit cards to passports, from hospital visits to houses. Now further taxes on cars will be imposed. It is incredible that after two years of abusing the electorate's trust, the Government rolls out more increases.</P>
      <P>Over the last 12 months, there has been a long list of punitive increases. Local authorities have been forced to introduce development levies of between &euro;6,000 to &euro;30,000, which will raise &euro;700 million from house buyers. There are levies on industrial development which will make some counties uncompetitive against some of their richer neighbours. The drug payments scheme threshold was raised by &euro;8 to &euro;78 per month, the third increase in the year, with the result that people with chronic illnesses will be priced out of the health market. Accident and emergency charges are up from &euro;40 to &euro;45. As I said before, it is now cheaper to arrive with one's own trolley at an accident and emergency department. The cost of a private bed in a public hospital has increased 15%. The cost of an overnight hospital stay increased &euro;5 to &euro;45 per night, with a cap of ten nights per year.</P>
      <P>Students did not escape these stealth taxes, with the third level registration fee increased by &euro;80 to &euro;750. The fees for junior and leaving certificate examinations have gone up &euro;10 to &euro;82 and &euro;86, respectively. The fee for a standard ten-year passport will increase on 1 March by almost one third from &euro;57 to &euro;75. The cost of a three-year passport for infants aged up to three years will rise from &euro;12 to &euro;15 and a five-year passport for those aged between three years and 18 years will also rise from &euro;12 to &euro;25. The emergency fee for passport applications, processed outside of office hours, will go up &euro;37 to &euro;100 for adults. I will, however, concede that the price of a ten-year passport for senior citizens has been cut from &euro;57 to &euro;25.</P>
      <P>Motor tax will rise by 5% in this Bill which is a perfect example of the Government's arrogance. The Bill increases taxes on private vehicles by an Administration that promised not to do so and to improve public transport. It has misled the electorate and failed in its duty. Were the state of our public transport not so lamentable, we might not be so concerned. As well as taxing motorists into the ground, the Government has failed to provide alternative <Col N="59"/>methods of public transport. The Government's record in this area is already woeful. The construction of Luas is late. The Dublin metro project is years away. The rail network is one of the worst in western Europe. I had personal experience of it on Tuesday morning last, with a five and a half hour journey from Cork. The rural bus network is dreadful. This week the transport unions went on strike. Commuters are now driven to distraction, on to the roads in their cars, choking the streets and stuck in traffic.</P>
      <P>As I said on 25 November 2003, the Fine Gael Party is opposed to the provisions of this Bill and the dreadful breach of the people's trust that we have seen by this Government in this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Deputy Allen in stating that the Labour Party is also opposed to this Bill on a number of grounds. As Deputy Allen has pointed out, this Bill is one of a sequence of taxes on everyday activities which the Government has introduced by the backdoor. This is a Government that proclaims it is a low taxation one. It frequently draws attention to how it has reduced taxes on income and that there are no taxes on wealth, property or stallions. However, they are being replaced with taxes on citizen's everyday activities.</P>
      <P>A family that sends a child to college will pay, in effect, a tax through increased registration fees. A person visiting a hospital will pay a tax through admission charges. Every morning when a refuse bin is put out, a tax is paid on it. Every time that one goes to a shop, additional taxes imposed by the Government are paid.</P>
      <P>The motorist is hit no fewer than four different times by Government taxation. When one buys a vehicle, one pays VAT, VRT charges and motor tax on it. When one buys fuel for it, tax is also paid. In normal circumstances, a 5% increase in motor taxation would not cause great excitement. However, when it is taken in the context of the series of additional stealth taxes that the Government has introduced, then it must be opposed.</P>
      <P>It must also be opposed because of the way that it is used. Motor taxation is intended to be the instrument through which funds are provided for the local government fund and non-national roads. I must again express my disappointment at the biased and unfair way in which those moneys are distributed. The Minister of State, in his speech, drew attention to the Government's largesse in recent years to the local government fund and non-national roads. What he did not take into account, were the increased roles and responsibilities that local authorities now have. Through Government decisions rather than their own, their costs have increased and they must find resources to meet those costs.</P>
      <P>This is an exceptional year, however, in that regard. With local elections coming up, the <Col N="60"/>Government managed to find some additional moneys for the local government fund. It remains to be seen, however, if those moneys, intended to take the sting out local authority decisions for the 2004 Estimates, will remain for 2005 and remaining years. I have my doubts.</P>
      <P>The local government fund is itself unevenly distributed. There has never been proper accountability of the fund to this House. Last year, when we debated the 2003 version of this Bill, I proposed on Committee Stage that an annual report be made on the fund and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government be required to report to this House as to what goes into and out of the local government fund, how it is distributed and what criteria are used for its distribution. The basis on which the fund is distributed between local authorities needs to be debated in this House and the Minister made publicly accountable for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State drew attention to the allocation this year of &euro;447 million to the fund for non-national roads. He did not tell us, however, how that money was allocated to local authorities or how badly urban authorities in particular fare in the distribution of that money. Only 12% of the &euro;447 million for 2004 was allocated to all the urban authorities put together. I do not wish to make invidious comparisons but it is difficult to escape the fact that the Minister's constituency, Waterford city and county, received almost &euro;21 million, almost twice the &euro;11 million allocated to Dublin city. The total allocated to the urban authorities was &euro;36 million for the city authorities, &euro;10.6 million of which was for Waterford city; &euro;3.5 million to the urban borough councils; and &euro;14.5 million to all the town councils together.</P>
      <P>I spoke before about the serious neglect of urban roads, particularly tertiary roads, those in housing estates on which most of the payers of this tax travel every morning to work. They are in a state of disrepair and no money is being spent on them. It is interesting to hear the Minister say that he will require local authorities to put their own resources into the roads programme and reward those which increase their resource expenditure if he is not accountable for the way in which the local government fund is allocated, and little or no account is taken of the relative ability of local authorities to raise money from commercial authorities. The circumstances of local authorities vary &mdash; some have a large rate base, others have not. If no account is taken of that and if there is a disproportionate allocation of the non-national roads fund between different authorities and the Minister offers to reward authorities if they raise additional charges, levies or commercial rates to upgrade the roads locally, motorists in those areas will ask where their motor tax is going.</P>
      <P>I do not know what proportion of motor taxation is raised in urban areas but the figure for <Col N="61"/>all the cities and towns together is closer to 60% than 12% of the total amount of motor tax raised. It will be increasingly difficult to tell those who pay motor tax that the urban authorities in which they live will receive only 12% of the total allocation in a given year. Those people must drive on roads in their housing estates and immediate neighbourhood which are potholed, broken and in a state of disrepair and which in many cases need reconstruction rather than repair or resurfacing.</P>
      <P>When I raised this previously the response was that a firm of consultants would carry out a study but apparently this will not be complete until August. There will be the farce in coming months of candidates from the Government parties picking their way over potholes and broken pavements in urban areas where they are canvassing to meet the frustrated householders and motorists who endure those roads every day and tell them a study is being done. The study will not appear until August and then it will be forgotten, as so often happens to such issues which arise after an election.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will oppose this Bill on the grounds of the additional stealth taxes proposed in it, that the Minister is distributing the moneys raised in motor taxation in a way that is unfair, biased and takes no account of the needs of respective areas, and that, scandalously, in his last allocation, he showed an unashamed bias towards his own electoral needs rather than the needs of motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Twomey, Morgan and Cuffe.</P>
      <P>I oppose this Bill. The Minister of State mentioned that the bills and moneys received as receipts from motor tax are topped up annually and that the fund is used to finance general purposes and needs for local authorities and non-national road grants. It would have been fair to do that in proportion to the taxes paid by each county, in particular counties Cavan and Monaghan and the Border counties. The level of receipts from motor tax returns from these counties is far above that of other counties in our neighbourhood. For example, the motor tax returns from County Monaghan amount to &euro;10.07 million for 2003, for Cavan they amount to in the region of &euro;10.6 million and for Louth approximately &euro;15.53 million. By comparison, in neighbouring counties such as Longford the return was &euro;5.6 million and in Leitrim, &euro;4.6<Miles com="jy"/>million. This should have been reflected in the amount of money coming back to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>We need new bypasses for Monaghan and Cavan, the proposed cost of which seems high &mdash; for example, the Carrickmacross bypass is estimated at &euro;28 million to &euro;30 million, the Castleblayney bypass, approximately &euro;112 million and the Monaghan bypass, phase one, &euro;23 million <Col N="62"/>and phase two, &euro;57 million. The dates set are September 2004 for the Monaghan bypass and 2005-06 for the Castleblayney bypass. Would the Minister consider topping that up to give the boost required for these projects? We are paying more than our fair share of tax in these Border counties. We pay a very high proportion of the revenue from diesel which we sell to Northern Ireland. I would like to think that we would be considered in that respect.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?><P>As regards taxing cars and lorries, lorries are a large part of people's livelihoods in County Monaghan. Cars and other forms of transport are an absolute necessity. The people of counties Monaghan and Cavan do not have any choice in terms of the type of transport they use to get to work. They cannot get on a No. 7 or No. 46A bus. There was talk about putting a railway line between Kingscourt and Navan to give people an alternative form of public transport. However, that will not happen. The Minister should seriously consider funding bypasses in my constituency so that the people do not have to wait 20, 30 or 40 minutes to drive through Cavan town, Castleblayney or Monaghan town. Money should be pumped into these counties. The people have paid more than their fair share of tax.</P>
      <P>Motorists are being hit with an unfair raft of disproportionate stealth taxes. Motorists could be described as punch drunk at this stage. Taxes amounting to &euro;22,000 will be paid on a family car which costs approximately &euro;21,500 over a ten-year period. The figure of &euro;21,500 includes VAT of &euro;4,500 and added taxes of &euro;3,000. The total road tax on a car over a ten-year period would amount to &euro;3,500 and estimated petrol taxes would amount to &euro;10,000. That is based on 12,000 miles per annum and an average consumption of 30 miles per gallon. Insurance levies and VAT charges on servicing the car over a ten-year period would amount to a further &euro;480. The already fleeced motorist is ripe for further plucking in the eyes of the Minister for Finance. This is in addition to a 12% increase in motor tax this time last year and a 7% increase in VRT on vehicles over 1900 cc. Motorists are seen as a means of getting more money.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the heads of Europe's largest motoring organisations launched a new motorist charter in Brussels. The message was that the unfortunate motorist had had enough and that there should be a moratorium on new motoring and road tax increases. The Minister should take that on board. The Government might as well have been idle if its action since then is anything to go by. Taxes have continued to increase and that has led to a breakdown in trust between motorists and the Government. Europe's motorists pay in excess of &euro;300 billion in taxes every year, yet only a quarter of that is reinvested in transport and mobility. As bad as the situation is internationally, our Government's record is worse. Last year the Government collected in <Col N="63"/>excess of &euro;3.8 billion in taxes from motorists, but it spent only approximately &euro;715 million, or<Miles com="jy"/>18%, on roads and transportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will come as a surprise to the constituents of County Wexford that the local authority has been well funded over the past seven years. With average increases of 17%, one would expect a corresponding increase in services. It is also surprising to read the figures produced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, on the number of roads which are supposed to have been improved since 1996. It seems that 32,000 kilometres of road have been dramatically improved since 1996, compared with 47,000 which are in poor condition. The condition of the roads in County Wexford have not improved dramatically over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>It is stated that local authorities will be able to spend the increased extra funding on whatever they wish, including sewerage systems and social housing. We have not seen any extra funding in County Wexford. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, is here because he has been a strong critic of the local authority on a number of occasions. He might be in a position to enlighten me in that regard.</P>
      <P>How will the money be spent on non-national roads? Last year the finance committee had a discussion on the fact that our roads seem to be in regular need of repair. We discussed how we could repair them because drainage was an issue after the flooding we had last year. Many of the local authorities pointed out that they only get enough funding to patch up the non-national roads and that they do not have enough money to carry out drainage works or to lay proper road surfaces. That seems to contradict much of what the Minister said in his speech about the fact that many roads have dramatically improved. They are only being patched up on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Motorists might accept the supposed increase in spending by the local authority if they got improved local authority services. However, no one could say that services have dramatically improved. Nothing is happening in Rosslare Harbour, for example, which is ideal for industrial development, because there is no sewage treatment plant for that area. Raw effluent is still being pumped into the sea. Although there are plans to build a new sewage treatment plant in the area, nothing has happened. It will be interesting to show these figures to my constituents and to tell them that such extra work could have been done over the past seven years because extra funding was supposed to have been given to the local authority.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is time to look at how the local authorities are spending the money. Is there a problem in all Departments in that money is <Col N="64"/>being wasted or not being used correctly? Is there a lack of transparency in terms of how the money is spent? Are Departments top heavy with management? The Department of Health and Children is regularly accused of being top heavy with management. It has also been stated that there is too much administration in the Department and that not enough work is being done at the frontline. If the 1996 and 2003 figures are to be believed, it is time to examine how the local authorities spend this money. It is one thing to give extra funding to local government, but it is another thing to spend it without any form of accountability. I have not seen a dramatic improvement in local government services, whether non-national roads, social housing or water and sewerage systems. I will be interested to hear the Minister's explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We seem to have an annual discussion on the type and scale of duties imposed on motor vehicles. I remember expressing similar sentiments last year, namely, that the measure we use for charging is crude. I and my party would like to see the introduction of a slightly more sophisticated measuring system. Instead of looking at the capacity of the engine, we should consider other issues, such as sustainability. We could closely examine transportation and the effect it has on sustainability. Instead of looking at the size of an engine, we should look at other indicators and reflect those in the type of charging system we use. The most obvious indicator is the carbon dioxide or climate change emissions from a vehicle. That data is readily available. It is not rocket science to find out what type of emissions come from an exhaust pipe and to reflect that in the charging mechanism we use or to reflect the more basic pollution load the vehicle creates. It would be easy to examine the basic pollution produced by a particular make, model and size of car. I am upset that the Department is not examining this in any detail and is not reflecting it in its charging system. It would make sense to incorporate this into the measures used.</P>
      <P>I note that the annual charge changes depending on the engine capacity and that the charge per cubic centimetre is low at the lower end of the scale and rises fairly substantially at the top. However, in looking at the scale, the increase per cubic centimetre seems to stop at about 2.5 litres and continues on a linear scale at higher levels. Even using the current crude scale instead of having a staggered or escalator tax, it would be possible to have a more linear equation that would continue to hit those who insist on driving cars with very large engines. There should be an increasing charge per cubic centimetre for cars with a capacity of more than 2.5 litres.</P>
      <P>We should also consider factors such as the kinds of accidents and severity of accidents caused by particular types of car. This week an article in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine investigated the kind of accidents that particular types of <Col N="65"/>vehicles cause. It specifically considered what the Americans call a sport utility vehicle, SUV, or what we would call a four-wheel drive, Jeep-type vehicle, and the typical accidents in which those vehicles are involved. It is not surprising to discover that the larger and more protected the vehicle is for the occupants, the more damage it causes to others.</P>
      <P>Some vehicles on the market with kangaroo or bull bars &mdash; huge bumpers &mdash; and very high cab positions represent the equivalent of a tank. The kind of damage they do when they hit smaller cars, pedestrians and vulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists is massive. The Department should investigate this and consider a taxing structure to reflect the greater damage these vehicles cause. Fortunately, as yet we do not have many of the Humvee-type Jeeps on Irish roads. Essentially a pedestrian hit by such a vehicle would be dead.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the statistics that show a pedestrian hit at 20 miles an hour has a 95% chance of survival and 5% chance of being killed; that at 30 miles an hour it is 50:50; and that at 40 miles an hour, nine and a half times out of ten the pedestrian will die. However a more sophisticated measure exists to the effect that the kind of armour or protection a vehicle has, if it is one of these four-wheel drive vehicles, ensures it becomes a deadly weapon. A school of thought believes we should introduce a super tax on the height of the driver above the road. While this is a crude barometer, it reflects that the higher the driver, the more damage a vehicle tends to do to another vehicle or road user.</P>
      <P>I introduce this matter to suggest that the Department should consider other indicators in the debate on vehicle taxation. The transportation sector is one of the major offenders in sustainability, regardless of whether we define sustainability as climate change emissions or the number of road deaths. The private car has led to carnage in its brief 100 years of existence. While for many the car has been a liberator, the lives of many others, including almost all in this Chamber, have been touched by death and injury on the roads. My party recommends more sophisticated measures to introduce more equity in an important area of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill represents yet another attempt by the Government to raise revenue through inequitable taxes. This is strange given that this right-wing Government and its leading ideologues pride themselves on low levels of taxation. While the Government imposes low levels of taxation, this applies only to the very wealthy and speculators while crippling ordinary working people and the lower paid through stealth taxes. The Revenue Commissioners 2002 survey showed 18% of the top 400 earners in the State pay an effective tax rate of less than 15% while benefiting from a raft of property based tax shelters created by the Government and retained <Col N="66"/>and extended in the Finance Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is clearly no hope that the Government will introduce reforms to create an equitable tax system which would bring about a fair distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly criticised the Government's habit of addressing revenue shortfalls through stealth taxes rather than through the general taxation system. The Government is not concerned at the impact measures such as this unwarranted increase in motor tax will have on the less well-off. All policies and, in particular, tax policies should be poverty proofed to asses their impact. The proportion of our population living on less than 50% of the average income has increased since 1997, when the previous Government took office. The national anti-poverty strategy outlines that nearly 25% of children in the State are living in poverty, representing some 300,000 children. This increase cannot be justified by the fact the money is being used for the funding of local government. We need immediate reform of local government funding to ensure it is properly funded and does not have to rely on arbitrary grants from the Government such as the revenue raised through this measure.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports public transport and believes that proper funding for the sector must be a Government priority. This Administration needs to begin the process of enabling people to move away from the excessive use of private vehicles. We support measures designed to reduce private car usage, which is both damaging to the environment and causes huge traffic problems, especially in the Dublin area. However, we are realistic enough to see that because the State has a severe deficiency of public transport, especially in rural areas where people are unable to make a behavioural change to public transport. We have not reached a stage where the alternative of public transport is available widely enough to allow motorists to use it in place of private transport. This problem is especially acute in rural areas.</P>
      <P>This is where we have a problem with the proposed increase. Motorists, especially young motorists, are crippled by insurance, tax and increasingly by tolls on the State's roads. The Government needs as a matter of urgency to increase the funding for public transport. The Minister of State said that all money raised from this measure will be put into improvements to non-national roads. However public transport in rural areas is in far greater need of investment. Rather than introducing this increased taxation on all motorists, the Minister of State should introduce measures linked to usage, such as carbon tax, which would encourage people to move towards public transport. Such a move is urgently needed to reduce CO<Miles par="8" com="cf"/>2<Miles par="1" com="cf"/> emissions, which have grown well beyond the limits permitted by the Kyoto Protocol.</P><Col N="67"/>
      
      <P>The State is facing a choice between paying enormous fines and spending huge amounts of revenue on emissions trading. We should take our responsibilities seriously and should not resort solely to emissions trading. The Exchequer will benefit from any actions which result in a reduction in emissions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o'clock</TimeSt><P>What is the Government doing to put in place proper public transport in rural Ireland? Rural citizens suffer disproportionately as a result of measures such as this motor tax increase as they have no choice but to use private transport. Why is the Government not increasing investment in rail? How will it respond to calls for the opening up of the western rail corridor?</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cullen's, mishandling of the State's obligations under the Kyoto agreement is reprehensible. The recently announced decision that our biggest industries will not be required to cut levels of carbon dioxide emissions is deeply disappointing, especially to those who are concerned about the effects of global warming and the future of the planet. It has been known for years that if we are to address the problem of global warming and reduce emissions output all states and governments will need to make difficult decisions. The Minister does not have the courage to stand up to vested interests in order to tackle global warming. He has capitulated to pressure from large industries and his Progressive Democrats Cabinet colleagues. Ordinary citizens and consumers will end up paying when carbon tax is introduced in 2005. If the tax is introduced on transport without any corresponding increased investment in the public transport sector it will achieve nothing.</P>
      <P>Some roads have received up to 85% funding from the European Union. Rather than benefiting from this, however, Irish motorists are expected to pay exorbitant tolls, which have themselves increased. This is grossly unfair. The motorist continues to be a soft target in the funding drive of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The poor condition of roads is also a problem. We are told that the local government fund is being distributed to local authorities, which is acceptable, but it is not adequately dealing with the condition of the roads.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a 5% increase in motor tax, but inflation is running at less than 2%. How can anybody stand over such a vast increase? The Government is being short-sighted on the issue of excise duty on petrol and fuel generally. In Border areas a vast number of people come from the North to buy their fuel because of lower prices. The Government is missing an opportunity by not keeping revenue low on fuel prices, because in these areas alone millions of euro are generated in this way. It is unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to capitalise on this. Not only does the price differential <Col N="68"/>provide jobs in Border areas, it also brings revenue into villages along the Border which for many years have been starved of that type of trading.</P>
      <P>All types of people in rural Ireland, particularly older people, find that a car is essential. They cannot get to the shops or the post office. Very often their local post office has been closed and they must go elsewhere for their pensions. They cannot get to Mass or avail of services without a car. These are the people who can least afford to pay these taxes. The 5% hike in motor tax will severely hit them. The Government has made a major mistake. I ask that the Minister reconsider the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2004. Speaking in the House on the Finance Bill recently, I made the point that while we all dislike paying tax, all Deputies would agree that in a caring society people recognise their commitment to fund the Government, particularly in such areas as health, education and social welfare, and the most equitable way of finding the money to do this is through taxation. What we are discussing is a form of tax, but the difference between this and all other forms of tax is that the motor tax intake is ring-fenced.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of being elected to Sligo County Council in 1991 and for my first number of years as a county councillor it was cloth and ashes. We were scrabbling, saving and skimping to try to look after our roads. Since 1999, however, when the local government fund was established, the money gathered through motor taxation has come back to the county directly. The amount for use by the county has now been greatly added to by central Government. The result has been a dramatic improvement in our non-national roads. I have listened carefully to the remarks of some of the other Deputies. While much remains to be done for our non-national roads, class 1 and class 2 non-national roads are in infinitely better condition than they were five years ago. It is important that this tax remains ring-fenced so that motorists in Sligo, Wexford or anywhere else know that when they pay their tax the money comes straight back to their counties, with the addition of a substantial amount from central funds.</P>
      <P>For many years paying motor tax was an ordeal. People went to their local motor taxation office and queued for hours on end. In some cases in Dublin people queued for more than two days. Over recent years the facility of paying motor tax by post has become available and is now widely used. Since last November the Government, pursuing its e-government strategy, has been running a pilot study in three local authority areas &mdash; north Tipperary, Clare and Galway &mdash; in which people could pay their motor tax over the Internet from their home PCs. The uptake has been in the region of 6% in the first couple of <Col N="69"/>months. From 1 March this facility will be extended nationwide. This is a positive move.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to making progress in the area of e-government. The Central Statistic Office estimates that there are more than 1.9 million home PCs in this country. This initiative will result in even shorter queues in motor tax offices. Up to now there have been few problems with the pilot scheme. Ireland is one of the first countries in Europe to embark on this. We are the envy of the United Kingdom, which makes a nice change, as for many years we slavishly followed its lead in many areas. It is nice to know that we are now leading the way. The model used here is based on a system which is widely used in Australia. The Government is to be commended for making this option available to everybody from 1 March.</P>
      <P>Few of the previous speakers referred to the content of the Bill. I am sure Members would agree that the return of the moneys raised in motor taxation to the county of origin is the most important aspect and it is something I applaud. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>According to the Minister of State, the increase in motor tax rates will yield an additional &euro;34 million in the current year. This rate increase has been in operation from 1 January 2004 and anyone who has had to renew his or her motor tax has paid an additional 5%. The motorist is heavily taxed, having to pay VAT, VRT, road tax and fuel tax. A motor car is not a luxury but an essential necessity to get people, particularly young people, to and from work.</P>
      <P>It was stated that the money will be ring fenced, but it may be used for a variety of general purpose needs of local authorities and to finance non-national road grants. I would like &ldquo;the general purpose needs of local authorities&rdquo; to be defined, in order to know for what exactly the yield from motor tax can be used. It is not ring fenced to the extent that it is solely used for roads purposes. Could it be used to pay benchmarking awards? As stated, it may be used for the upkeep of social housing, operation and maintenance of public water and sewerage systems, waste management, care of the natural environment and running the fire services and so on. As it is not ring-fenced solely for investment in roads, the motorist is not getting value for the 5% increase. In other words, it is simply another local tax to replace what was given to local authorities in rates support grants. The development charges introduced this year are similar. Some local authorities are not introducing the development charges as they consider a charge ranging from <Col N="70"/>&euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 up to &euro;20,000 is a very severe penalty on first-time buyers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is taking a new direction to raise local taxation. The total grant allocation for non-national roads is &euro;477 million in 2004. I live in Galway city where there are approximately 50,000 cars, however I do not know how that figure compares with the number of cars in rural areas. The money paid in motor taxation is not spent in proportion to the area in which it was raised, certainly the yield from 50,000 cars is not spent on non-national roads in Galway city. We are a long way from what the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government did in 1977 when it was in a tight corner and abolished motor taxation as well as rates to win a general election. Motor taxation is back and is accepted as local taxation.</P>
      <P>On the question of rebates of tax for disabled drivers and disabled passengers, in 1997 the Minister for Finance set up a review group to look into this matter which I understand reported to him in October 2002. Yet the Minister has never published that report or made known its recommendations. Will he consider amending the regulation that 10% of the net cost of the car must be spent in converting it for use by a disabled driver or passenger, even though in some cases it may not be necessary?</P>
      <P>How much money do the urban councils spend? Some &euro;27 million was allocated in local road grants to Waterford city. The Minister of State pointed out that the 2004 package was increased by 10%, the largest increase in recent years. We all, of course, realise that the local elections will be held this year and the councillors from the Government parties have to be appeased by increasing spending on the roads programme.</P>
      <P>The 5% additional increase in motor taxation is taking an extra &euro;34 million tax from the motorist who is taxed at every move he or she makes. Will the Minister consider the points we have raised? I know the majority will ensure the Bill will be passed and the reality of the 5% increase in motor taxation will become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Devins stated that nobody likes paying tax, but we have to pay it to fund government. People are browned off paying additional tax to fund this Government. Nobody minds paying his fair share, if he sees results. It is not that long ago since I sat across the floor from this Minister and spoke about services on the ground. People are not seeing results on the ground and that is why they do not like paying tax. Even if one paid twice the level of tax, one would not see any difference. Unless we guarantee improvements and give value for money, we cannot look for higher taxes.</P>
      <P>It is wrong for a Government to increase the amount of tax being raised for no real specific reason, except for the fact that it has the power to do so and needs to fund the terrible lack of planning and a total mismanagement of funds in <Col N="71"/>the past number of years. It is wrong and as a Member, I must oppose it. I cannot agree to the Bill.</P>
      <P>If I thought the money raised would fix the potholes throughout the country and improve the roads by making them safer, I might support it, but there is no guarantee of that. Last year we were told that increases in motor taxation would be ring-fenced and result in increased expenditure on roads. It did not happen. In County Meath the increase in the roads grant did not match inflation. How can I believe that this additional taxation will improved matters on the ground? I do not believe it, however much I would like to. Based on last year's commitments, I cannot.</P>
      <P>Apart from a basic income tax level, all tax takes should be optional. If one uses a facility or a service, one should pay for it or lose the use of the facility or service. It should be policy that the user pays. Any other policy, as this Government has proved, brings about a scrappy system of government, such as the one we have, where over-spends occur safe in the knowledge that a stroke of a pen, or any other type of stroke, can and will gain more revenue for the Government. There is no encouragement to save money, because nobody is going to stop the Government raising more taxes.</P>
      <P>A real increase in the amount being raised in motor taxation without a definite reason for doing so cannot be justified and the same can be said about increasing taxation involving motor vehicles, especially when there is no guarantee of achieved results. The Government is increasing a form of taxation that people in the modern age have no choice but to pay. It is the same as putting a gun to one's head while a greedy hand is being slipped into one's pockets. It is State-backed extortion.</P>
      <P>People should not be over-penalised for doing what they have to do, in this case to drive to and from work. It is bad enough that commuters are forced to drive for four or five hours each day just to get to work but to impose extra charges on them for the privilege is crazy. It is no wonder people are fed up with this country. If a citizen is not to become a burden on the coffers of the State, he or she must work. This Bill penalises people for going to work. It is a work tax.</P>
      <P>To add insult to injury, the Government has implemented policies to keep this vicious circle going through bad planning. Houses are located away from workplaces and factories. There are vast, stand alone areas with no integration of home, work and play areas. Vast estates have been built in such a way that if one were to consider providing an underground or overground rail network in the future, its design would resemble the sewing on a patchwork quilt or the Red Cow disaster on an even bigger scale. County Meath is a prime example. Thousands of houses have been built in Ratoath, Ashbourne, <Col N="72"/>Dunboyne, Navan, Kells and Moynalty. However, no jobs followed the thousands of houses, only thousands of people. The result is that people must commute to their jobs. This is bad planning and bad Government and has resulted in the need for more taxes just to try to maintain the roads at a half decent standard, not to mind fund new modes of transport.</P>
      <P>No definite policy exists for building in such a way that, with a ruler on a map, a straight line could be drawn to enable public transport to be built or operated efficiently near all housing schemes and industrial areas. Have we not learned anything from past mistakes in planning? We have not. Now, the Government intends to centralise the health service, to make regional hospitals into major centres of excellence and to threaten hospitals such as the one in my home town of Navan. People are being forced to travel 20 miles to Drogheda and 30 miles to Cavan for appointments, simple check-ups and treatment for minor injuries. However, there is a hospital more or less beside them which they cannot use. We will continue to force more people back onto the roads. It is crazy. Nevertheless, we still zone land and build houses in the greater Dublin region and beyond but no jobs are following them. We have not learned.</P>
      <P>Try getting from Coole in Westmeath or Moynalty in Meath to Dublin without a car to visit somebody in hospital. One would have to be on holiday pay to attempt that. This Government's refusal to invest properly in public transport, despite taking billions in taxation from the transport sector, is a disgrace and is choking the quality of life in this country. I am referring to proper investment in rail and quality roads which one will not have to pay a tariff to use. Any decent road in this country is tolled. Motorists pay a fortune to use them. The lorries do not use them but continue to break up the other roads. Where does the toll go? I could accept it if the toll returned to the State's coffers to pay for the building and repair of more roads. However, it does not return to the State. It goes into the coffers of private companies or across the water to provide a nice lifestyle for somebody else. Again, this is bad policy, like investing pension money in foreign exchanges and so forth and, probably, losing more money by doing so. Policies implemented by the Departments do not yield value for money and each time the Government loses money or gets bad value, it demands more tax from the people. The attitude is: &ldquo;You will sort out our problem&rdquo;. That is not good enough; it is not good Government.</P>
      <P>What is the tax money for? Will it be blown on the few over-priced projects which are supposed to start sometime in the next year or so even though traffic cones are used to mark the biggest potholes in County Meath? When I was a young fellow I often made signs to mark the potholes outside our house. I would get a piece of wood and a stick, paint the words &ldquo;Gone Fishing" or <Col N="73"/>&ldquo;Fishing&rdquo; on it and stick it in the pothole. I hoped it might lead to the pothole being repaired. It was long before I became involved in politics; I was only about ten years old. Generally, the pothole was fixed because it had been highlighted. A few years later, people started to spray yellow lines around potholes to highlight them and eventually they might be fixed. Green paint is used now. The latest practice, however, is to plonk red and white cones in the middle of these holes. They fit quite nicely. This happens in other counties as well as Meath and often the cones are put there by council staff in an effort to highlight the danger. This is pathetic, yet the Government is still seeking more tax to spend on the roads.</P>
      <P>The Government should get proper value for the money it has already and stop looking for more. If it does not wish to take my advice, perhaps the local election results will give this Department a wake up call. The people of Ireland have given enough money to dysfunctional Departments such as the Department of Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport. Given this country's lack of an integrated transport policy, the car is as important to life as the air we breathe, so how can the Department justify imposing more tax on it? It is madness. To a working man or woman the car is part of the family, just like the van or a lorry is to a business person, and just as if he or she were to lose an arm, leg or eye, the effect of any changes to the family vehicle is as dramatic. Every Member of the House knows this.</P>
      <P>It is wrong and a great shame that the car has become such a vital organ for living in Ireland. It is worse to add insult to that by imposing charges on people so they can continue to drive. This is where Government policy makes no sense. This Government treats the motoring public like a soft target to be hit by more tax at will. The Government encouraged the use of the car above other methods of transport, such as rail, bus and bicycle, and then taxed the people it encouraged to buy and use these cars. How can this be right? If Members of the House did their job properly, they would be considering a law to stop a Government doing this rather than a law endorsing this policy. Forcing people, as a result of bad planning, into a tax trap should be outlawed or certain things should be exempt from tax. If an alternative exists and one makes the personal choice to use the car, one should pay. It is the car and the petrol used in the car that have fuelled the lifestyle we enjoy. The Government should leave them alone.</P>
      <P>The Government should drop the demand for this tax, not increase the tax. Members of this House, like the people we represent, have been forced by the Government over many years to become car junkies. I resent the fact that due to an increase in taxation, I, like many others, will have to pay more for the habit I cannot quit. I cannot leave my car at home and do my job. That <Col N="74"/>is the failure of this Government. I live in a town just 34 miles from this House and I should be able to do my job without using the car but I cannot. Would even this Minister for Finance go so far as to put a tax on people's arms, eyes or legs? I doubt it and I hope I have not given him any ideas. How can this Government, as if it did not matter, take a figure out of the air and increase the car tax and registration fee by that amount? Stop this madness before permanent harm is done.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the money that was spent on roads and so forth. I must be living on a different planet. Last year, I heard this money would be ring-fenced. The money Meath County Council received did not match inflation. The population in Navan town is approximately 25,000 and there are thousands more houses in the surrounding area. Councillors squabbled over &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 to be spent on maintenance and to fix and repair county and non-national roads. That is just to keep the roads safe. That is terrible. We are not getting value for money. I do not see any of the tax that is collected coming to Meath. There is talk that this money will go to the local government fund and it will be topped up by the Exchequer. That money is composed of other tax; it is our money as well. The Minister talks about the fund as if it will come from somewhere else but it is just more tax revenue. The money is all going into the same pot but we are not getting value for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the local government fund is available to complement other income sources such as specific State grants, commercial rates and so forth. Let us take County Meath as an example. As a result of Government policy and the lack of jobs, the county's commercial rate is between &euro;9 million and &euro;11 million. Other councils' increases in 2003 were &euro;9 million or &euro;11 million. Fingal County Council collects approximately &euro;70 million in rates. There is a big difference. If Government policy leads to a county such as Meath missing out on money yet causes extra problems for that county, something is wrong. It is not fair.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about the increases in budgets over the years and there is constant comparison with how things were in 1997. I did my leaving certificate in 1997. The country has changed dramatically since then and I am fed up to the teeth of hearing Minister after Minister comparing like with unlike, that is, the figures for 2004 with those for 1997. It was a different generation and a different millennium.</P>
      <P>I could say a great deal more on this subject. The money is not there and it is a joke to keep saying it is. It has been said that the money raised has increased and that we will get more out of it. This money will not even repair the roads we have at the moment and certainly will not build any new roads in our towns. In fact, we are bringing in development levies on new houses to build any new roads or bridges required in them. <Col N="75"/>It is one more tax, another hidden tax. It is not income tax because our taxes are still low but it is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>This money will not widen the roads to make them safer. It will not remove bends or humps. Filling in potholes and building a few new roads is not enough. We need to put more money into roads because traffic has increased on all of them. To restore roads to what they were ten or 15 years ago is not good enough. We need better roads and in view of this it is a disgrace to clap ourselves on the back for a small increase in money spent on them. I am sure the Minister of State would probably agree with me except he must stick to his script. He knows the amount raised is not enough and that much more is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, unlike Deputy Devins, I did not have the opportunity to listen to all of the previous speakers or the Minister of State so I hope I will be forgiven if there is some repetition. Deputy English made some astonishing claims about finances, taxation and various other matters. The most accurate statement he made was that this is a changed country since 1997. It is radically changed. The number of cars on the roads and their standard and quality is something not envisioned in 1997. People could not afford to run such cars then. Cars were old and battered but those are gone and we have a new era. In the past, Deputy Ring and others took some of the credit for previous years but only since 1997 has there been radical change. Deputy English is accurate in that regard.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to enact the changes in the increases in the motor tax rates and trade plate licences as provided for on 12 December. The increase in the standard rate is 12%. There have been a few technical amendments one of which has been discussed at some length &mdash; the question of being able to tax a vehicle through electronic means. This is critical. We have talked about such issues for years but nothing was done. Now the Government is taking action because the services have been put in place. People have complained constantly about the three and four hour queues in large cities, in the Cork area in particular. I welcome that we have now taken this step. I compliment the Minister on putting the legislation in place. It will make an enormous difference will save time for a million people or more.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCormack was scathing about where the moneys raised from these duties and licences go and ridiculed the term &ldquo;ring-fencing&rdquo;. I have worked in local government since 1974 and have participated in and led deputations to the Oireachtas to various Ministers over the years seeking funding for non-national roads. We always went home with fairly empty pockets because the Government did not have the money and could not manage to give funding. As part of <Col N="76"/>all-party deputations I visited different Ministers of different parties but we never had a breakthrough until 1998.</P>
      <P>That breakthrough was essential because major urban areas such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford were not getting their fair share. Roads in those areas were used by millions of vehicles over the year by people who did not reside in the area or contribute locally. These areas also had some peculiar difficulties. Cork City Council put together a position paper and made a presentation on it but got no action until the previous Government took power.</P>
      <P>We must look at the facts and be honest about them. Since 1998, there has been a radical breakthrough. In my area we have completed a programme which started about the end of 1999 when the money started coming through. We have completely resurfaced well over 150 housing estates, something previously unheard of. Prior to that we would have had to borrow to resurface one or two estates and they would have to be in a state of rack and ruin before they were done. The reason for that was because the funding had to come from local contributions. Even then Cork was paying its fair share but I know some areas did not do the same.</P>
      <P>Local elections are due shortly and are in everybody's mind at present. In the 1991 local elections, if my memory serves me correctly, three candidates were elected on the issue of potholes. If we think back to the state of the roads in 1991, it was right for people to say they would take some kind of action on the issue and elect pothole candidates. I doubt we will see any pothole candidates being elected next June because they will not find potholes to stand over.</P>

	<P>I can name several in Dublin for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>One can drive around the country and if one picks a particular road and says it is in bad condition, there will be a sc&eacute;al about it. There will be a story covering it. The story will be that it has been taken in charge, or something else. There is no comparison between the road surfaces paid for directly from this money and the situation we had before.</P>
      <P>I will be 29.5 years involved in local government in June. If Deputy Ring wins his case, I might hang in for another 30 years or so. I have been honoured to do that job over those years and managed to come top of the poll most of the time. I must have been doing something right. One of the main changes I have seen over that time has been the increase in the funding for surfacing the roads in the area.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCormack was also scathing about the money being used, perhaps, for other concerns. I have no problem with that. In Cork we have built a number of pedestrian bridges with moneys from this fund and from the moneys from high-rise parking fees because these areas are <Col N="77"/>complementary to one another. This is a logical approach and I am happy we are taking it.</P>
      <P>One of my bugbears, related to our road work, is the digging of trenches on roads which have been resurfaced. In Cork we have resurfaced 97 primary roads. These are road works which are 50% grant aided. Unfortunately, trenches have been opened on a number of them within 12 months of being resurfaced. When I was a member of Cork City Council I repeatedly raised this issue, including and when I chaired the roads committee. The council has now put an agreement in place with service providers that following the reinstatement of the road and a three months settlement period the provider must provide a full lane width replacement. However, I do not like the digging of trenches because somebody must pay for the services being laid. Often it is the taxpayer. Cork has suffered badly in this regard. We started with natural gas and cut up the city streets to replace the old town gas. Three or four years later, there was multi-channel television and the streets were cup up again. There has also been the usual water and electricity repairs and so on, followed by broadband when, again, the streets were cut up.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in arguing for the sake of it when I cannot make a positive, constructive argument against something and propose an alternative. For 20 years I have argued that ducting or conduit should be laid at all times when a road is fully reinstated. There should not be any need to cut up roads because the services should be placed in ducting. This was done in the United States a hundred years ago in the sidewalks of New York so I do not see why we cannot do it. I hope the current cost to servicepeople will deter them a little bit in cutting up roads. This money pays for these roads. There is a direct relationship between the two and I do not want to see any of it wasted.</P>
      <P>Phenomenal work is being done on all aspects of transport. I listened to the Green Party whingeing as usual about too much money being spent on roads. I travelled both the Watergrasshill and the Kildare bypasses this morning, both of which major projects were opened by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. I feel much safer driving on these roads than the previous old boreen-style road that was south of Kildare.</P>
      <P>There is no conflict with the argument put forward by the Green Party about supporting rail over roads. Any project that has been put forward, whether it be in Dublin city or elsewhere, has had its detractors. The country Deputies tend to whinge about Dublin getting everything while Dublin based ones want more. I have not heard the Minister or his colleagues argue with anybody, be it on Luas, metro, railway safety or anything else. The Minister will probably re-open the western rail corridor before he finishes his term in 2007.</P>

	<P>Deputy Dennehy was not out with him when I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cork area strategic plan, CASP, for the next 20 years is based around the Blarney to Midleton railway line and there has been a positive reaction to this. This is contrary to what the Opposition says. In the county hall in Cork three weeks ago, I and the other members of Cork County Council along with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and all our Oireachtas colleagues heard Deputy Stanton complain that the National Roads Authority had overspent two years running. Today I heard Deputy McCormack say that not enough money is being spent on roads. Let us get it right. A great deal of money is being spent and the work is being done well. I do not see a conflict between rail and road, but safety must be of paramount importance at all times.</P>
      <P>I could be parochial, as other speakers were, on all aspects of transport. Some &euro;140 million was spent on Cork Airport, &euro;137 million on the Ballincollig bypass and I already referred to the Watergrasshill bypass. The Kinsale road flyover is another local example. I do not see a problem. We receive our fair share in Cork, as I am sure does every other part of the country. All regions have good representatives to make the case in a positive fashion, as do we. I do not go along with the whingeing. Everybody receives a fair share.</P>
      <P>One imbalance I hope this legislation will rectify to some extent is the situation where fleets of vehicles have been registered in Dublin. It has been another false source of funding, as it has been with the rate base generally, in that the Dublin local authorities received motor tax funding from some vehicles registered in Dublin but located elsewhere in the State and funding from other sources located in Dublin. The result was that, for many years, they did not need to apply service charges which everybody else throughout Europe saw as essential. I hope one of the side effects of decentralisation will be the diversion of funding into local areas from the Central Fund as more registrations take place locally. I want to see both drivers and vehicles registered in the towns to which they relocate. This is only right and will divert money into areas that were not able to compete when it was a question of allocating money according to the number of vehicles in a county area.</P>
      <P>Deputy English had concerns about value for money on projects. I was concerned that so much work was being done in the target dates he gave, from 1997 to 2002, that we were not getting value for money because the economy and industry heated up to the point where the cost of projects was not right. We needed to change that and have done so. We now have a method in place whereby we will get more value for money. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts which monitors this.</P>
      <P>One factor which has made this happen to some extent is the arrival of foreign construction <Col N="79"/>firms. For instance, a Turkish company is building the Ballincollig to Bishopstown bypass in Cork. Like other local representatives, I was lobbied and told that these people would not have experience of this kind of project, would be slow, would not complete it for 20 years and would give rise to a huge overrun. The Secretary General of the Department of Transport informed me last week that the project is within budget, is five or six weeks ahead of schedule and will open shortly. This conflicts with what was said. I believe her on this issue, as I do the officials who give us facts and figures.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with trade plate licences. Trucks are becoming so large, people want the height of the port tunnel in Dublin to be raised to accommodate them. We fought Europe for five or six years on the axle weight of trucks. We did not want monster trucks and we took the right road on that one &mdash; no pun intended.</P>
      <P>There is a need for more control over this type of vehicle &mdash; the juggernaut and the 40 foot truck &mdash; especially in regard to speed. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister a fortnight ago and concluded that the figures I received which are the speed limits for these trucks are being ignored by many drivers. Some 95% of professional truck drivers are competent, respectful and careful, but there is a small percentage which has a total disregard for other road users. Might is right in their book.</P>
      <P>I experienced two incidents in the past month, both of which occurred south of Horse and Jockey in Tipperary near where a major fatality recently took place. In both instances a truck in an oncoming convoy overtook a car. Two thirds of the vehicle was in my lane. I was observant and saw it, but it could have been otherwise. There could certainly have been a fatality on both occasions. This cannot be allowed to continue. There is a need for more control over these vehicles, especially their speed. There is no comparison between a car being driven at 60 miles per hour and a car transporter or large truck, which do not have the same control, doing the same speed.</P>
      <P>Another hobby-horse of mine is the standard of road signs. I raised the matter in the Chamber three years ago in the context of the National Roads Authority. I also raised it last week with the Department of Transport. Some of the signs are atrocious. The method of construction is the problem; they are made from separate pieces. I urge the NRA to look at a sign which is 50 yards south of Lisheen mines in north Tipperary which now has a three foot gap in the centre of it. The top half reads &ldquo;NRA&rdquo;, a company which is very proud of its work, and the bottom half is three feet lower. That is an example of what should not be done. Instead of a horizontal join, there should be a vertical one.</P>
      <P>The standard of signs has improved enormously and I pay tribute to the NRA and <Col N="80"/>those involved for this. In the interests of safety, I asked them to put reflective studs on the traffic islands that are built near villages and towns. This has not happened, except in New Inn, County Tipperary, where a mini-roundabout has had reflective studs installed on it. If one looks at these islands, one will see tyre marks on them. They are a major hazard and should not be built by the NRA or local authorities carrying out work under the guidance of the NRA. I appealed to the director general on this issue and I made an appeal to the Secretary General of the Department last week. I hope someone will carry out the small job of installing reflective studs on these islands.</P>

	<P>I have been a member of a local authority for 25 years. While I will not discuss this tonight, with luck I will be a member of the authority for a bit longer. I was elected to this House in 1994 and the biggest issue facing us when we came into Government was roads. The Fine Gael and the Labour parliamentary parties discussed the issue and decided that we could not put up with the condition of roads in this country. This was the first time there was discussion on setting up a fund specifically for roads. Deputy Howlin was the then Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State was my colleague, Deputy Allen. We tackled this issue and did a good job on it. I am glad to say that things have continued from there.</P>
      <P>Drivers in this country must be the softest people in the world to put up with the taxation and abuse we get from the Government. When one purchases a car one must pay VRT. We were told that on joining the European Union we would be able to import cars from elsewhere in Europe without paying VRT. The Government quickly got a derogation from this when it found it was losing tax revenue. This was wrong. This is a hobby horse of mine and I have always reminded people of this when canvassing in referendum campaigns.</P>
      <P>In addition to VRT, car owners are taxed by having to pay motor taxation and further taxes on diesel and petrol. There are three or four new taxes for car owners. There are garda&iacute; behind <Col N="81"/>hedges in every corner of the country with cameras. They are trying to catch people speeding in 30 miles per hour zones. I do not have a problem with the garda&iacute; catching people breaking the speed limit in a 60 miles per hour zone but I am concerned at how this is used to collect revenue for the State. Last year I tabled a question that sought to ascertain information on this. When I discovered how much revenue the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collected for the State, I wondered whether its purpose was to collect revenue for the Government or to do a job. People have told me that they have been caught driving at 35 or 36 miles per hour in 30 miles per hour zones. That is not fair.</P>
      <P>Last week I saw a car clamped on Merrion Street that had its side window broken. The clampers have cameras all over this city to note the length of time cars are parked in certain places. Clampers are now more available than taxis &mdash; they can be found at any minute of any hour. However, their cameras are not used to identify persons who break into cars.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that we are always attacking the motorist. Motorists are going to have to stand up for themselves. As there is no public transport, people living in rural areas need a car to get to work and travel around. Rural Ireland is not like Dublin; it does not have the Luas light rail system or a metro. The people of Dublin are soft. They should have taken to the streets in their thousands over the way in which they were abused by the State when the Luas works were happening in the city. It is outrageous that the public had to put up with such inconvenience. Nobody minds putting up with inconvenience for the sake of progress. However, this beautiful city has been destroyed. As I said in the House five years ago, the Luas light rail system should have been built underground. Those involved have made a mess of it. They have lost control and do not know what is happening. I will be surprised if we ever see Luas travelling around St. Stephen's Green.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o'clock</TimeSt><P>Drivers now have to have their cars tested under the NCT when they are four years old. It is another money racket for the Government and the greatest one that was ever introduced. A person involved with the NCT was interviewed on &ldquo;Five-seven live&rdquo; and I was sorry that I did not have my mobile telephone with me so that I could call the radio station. A man from my constituency had his car fail the emissions element of the NCT. He took the car back within the specified period and, without having had any repairs or otherwise carried out, his car passed the same test. This proved to me that the NCT is a money racket and a con job to fleece taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I would not mind if we had good roads. Ministers visited my constituency last weekend and the Taoiseach has also visited it in the past. How do Ministers travel to my constituency? They fly to Knock Airport where they are met by <Col N="82"/>the State driver that was sent ahead of them. Is this not an admission in itself?</P>
      <P>The people of Dublin are soft and I do not know how they put up with motorcades. I was travelling on the M50 and heard the screeching of five or six motorcycles escorting a Mercedes. I am sorry I did not see what Minister was in the Mercedes because I would have jumped out of my car and pulled him out of his. They wanted me to pull out of my lane. I was coming towards the edge of the M50 and there was no place I could go. The motorbikes screeching up and down frightened the life out of me and I was worried that I had done something wrong. There was probably no one in the Mercedes and they were only on a practice run. While I am proud that we hold the Presidency of the EU, those in State cars should not put people off the road and hold up traffic when there is no need for it. The Taoiseach should lead by example. However, I had the same problem with him a few months ago when I was on my way to the west. The motorcade swooped past me and while I tried to tail them, I could not keep up with them.</P>

	<P>I do not know. Deputy Dennehy referred to the money that has been spent on infrastructure. The local authorities are getting funding. However, as has been revealed today, local authorities are the fastest growing industry in the world. While every other company is downsizing, local authorities are upsizing. What is happening cannot continue. It was reported today that 20,000 public servants were employed in the last year. What happens when public servants are employed? Taxes must be raised on cars, directly and indirectly, to pay their salaries.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have gone out of control. They are no longer answerable to this House and have their own auditing systems. It is time for the House, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with them.</P>

      <P LI="1">&mdash;consult with, or seek the agreement of, the other parties in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the fundamental change in our electoral system involved in the extension of the use of electronic voting to all constituencies and electoral areas for the European and local elections;</P><Col N="83"/>

      <P FLI="0" LI="1">and bearing in mind the considerable legal uncertainty regarding the legislative basis for the implementation of electronic voting in the local and European elections in June of this year, calls on the Government to immediately defer plans for the use of electronic voting in the European and local elections and to suspend any further expenditure on, and preparations for, the introduction of electronic voting until an independent electoral commission has been established and has addressed the legitimate concerns of political parties and the public on this issue.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I wish to share my time with Deputies Rabbitte and Sargent.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving this motion collectively because of the urgency and gravity of the matter in hand. This is not a matter of mere technology. We are debating the quintessence of democracy &mdash; how we, as democrats, elect those who govern us. We are addressing the power, significance and value of the individual vote. We are examining a development that can affect the security and accuracy of the electoral process and possibly even the validity of elections and the legitimacy of the Government in this country. That is why we need an electoral commission to oversee the implementation of electronic voting in a fair and transparent manner which has the trust of the political parties and the public alike.</P>
      <P>It would be fatally damaging to democracy if we introduced a system of voting whose configuration meant that the public could have neither ownership nor faith. At a time when a third of the citizens of this Republic claim to have no interest in politics, we should attempt to cultivate public confidence and participation in the political process instead of kill it. However, with its gung-ho attitude, the Government intends to carry on regardless. Owing to what we hope is merely political vanity, it is intent on railroading through a system of electronic voting about which many expert warnings have been and continue to be issued and about which serious political and public concerns have been raised.</P><Col N="84"/>
      <P>There is the further matter of whether the introduction is constitutional. On 5 February 2004, the T&aacute;naiste confirmed to this House that to implement electronic voting, legislative change would be required, and that the change would be by way of secondary legislation under section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001. The advice which Fine Gael has had for many weeks is that the making of an order which amends primary legislation in a way as substantive as that suggested by the T&aacute;naiste is unconstitutional. By making an order under section 48, the Minister would effectively assume the role of the Legislature, something that would be contrary to Article 15.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Today the Government has announced that it is to introduce primary legislation to facilitate the application of electronic voting to all D&aacute;il elections. That last-minute acknowledgement that new legislation is necessary simply highlights the incompetent way in which the entire process has been handled. However, this is about more than law. It concerns public trust, a precious commodity on which elections and Governments must be based. We have a coalition Government that treats the national Parliament as something between a tedious annoyance and a private political playground. We have an Administration that bought its re-election with the people's money and has commandeered the public finances as a private political electioneering fund. Today in the House we heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, say with equanimity that the timing of his decentralisation plans was driven solely by the political needs of his party.</P>
      <P>Then there is the matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. He is the person overseeing the introduction of electronic voting. He was forced to withdraw a public information document devised by a public relations company appointed by him and run by a former Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary such was the poor and skewed quality of the information that it contained. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, just happens to be the Fianna F&aacute;il director of elections. When it comes to elections, the same Government tells us that there is no problem, that it knows what it is doing, and that it is the Government and should be trusted. There are several political reasons trust and the Government are mutually exclusive.</P>
      <P>When one examines the practicality of the system that it proposes to foist on the country, there are other reasons that we cannot have trust, not least that the electoral process in this country could become the property of a privileged technological elite. First, there is the matter of suppression. The Government deliberately suppressed the 2002 report by the experts, <Col N="85"/>Zerflow Holdings, which showed that the machines to be used in e-voting are not tamper-proof.</P>
      <P>That brings us to the second reason not to have trust &mdash; vulnerability. Apart from rigging and sabotage, there are such politically benign yet critical difficulties as computer failure. Computer systems fail regularly. However, under the proposed system, in the event of failure, there will be no paper trail and no secondary system to verify the voting and counting process. Numerous experts, all of them technocrats and all of them professional, have warned that more tests need to be carried out before implementing the widespread use of electronic voting. In 2002, even the Comptroller and Auditor General warned the Government in the strongest terms on what it was about to do. He issued his independent validation warning on the grounds that: &ldquo;the integrity and security of the voting system is fundamental to the exercise of democracy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The third reason is the matter of public ownership of the electoral system &mdash; actual and perceived. At present, the public has ownership of that process. When a person casts his or her vote or puts it in the ballot box, that person knows that he or she has voted and for whom and can leave the polling station secure in that knowledge. It is both accountable and verifiable at every stage. Now, however, the Government wants the public to have electoral faith in a system of voting which cannot be properly scrutinised because of commercial sensitivity. It is wrong that the electorate or those running for election should have to accept, on no basis other than good faith and blind trust, the technological code that enabled the electoral process to take place. That technological code is held as a proprietary secret by a private Dutch company rather than in the public domain. The wider community of computer experts must be able to examine the source code. An open source code held for the public in the public domain is required rather than an entity with commercial sensitivity attached. The people of this country are entitled to believe that their democracy is worth more than the competitive advantage or future profits of any private company.</P>
      <P>We will have no paper trail. If one books one's holiday on-line and anything goes wrong, one will have a paper trail. If one takes cash from an ATM, one gets a receipt showing the transaction and how little one has left in one's account. If one pays for one's groceries in the supermarket, one gets a chit of paper indicating the transaction. However, if one casts one's vote into the black hole that is the Government's version of electronic voting, one simply hopes for the best. Under the Government's proposals, when one has pressed the button, whatever colour it is, one leaves the polling station without knowing what one has done. The machine does not tell one what one has done. One walks out of that polling station insecure in the knowledge that one's vote <Col N="86"/>has been registered in the way that one cast it. If we do not have a system in this country in which the voting electorate can have trust and faith, we are not doing our business, and the Government is wrong on this.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Green Party, to mention but three, have, for what it is worth, majority support in public opinion polls, and the Government, in the words of Bobby Molloy when he spoke in the Seanad as Minister of State, should not attempt to introduce something such as this unless it has all-party and cross-party support. The Government's belated anxiety, conversion and ability to listen a little to people's concerns leave much to be desired.</P>
      <P>If we do not have a verifiable paper system and a paper trail with which people can be happy, how can people have faith and trust in the election system? Every Deputy in the Chamber, with the exception of a few, has probably stood outside polling stations, large and small, in wet weather and in fine. When electors passed us on their way in and smiled benignly or otherwise, at least they cast their vote. When they passed us on their way out, they knew what they had done while we did not.</P>
      <P>In the case of electronic voting one cannot spoil one's vote. If a person informs a presiding officer that he or she wants to vote and decides, on seeing the ballot on the machine, that he or she does not like any of the candidates, he or she will not be able to register that choice. In addition, when the presiding officer switches off the machine, he or she will know that the person in question has not voted, which infringes the secrecy of the ballot box. It is a person's right to have an opportunity to vote against all candidates or to vote for one or another of them. If there is no such scrutiny, how can we possibly maintain the legitimacy of elections, never mind justify the legitimacy of government and public confidence in it?</P>
      <P>This system is at its most vulnerable at the point at which the programme reading units &mdash; PRUs &mdash; come into use. This occurs when the returning officer feeds all the disks into the central machine which then reads them for local and European elections. The system is technologically highly vulnerable at this point. Changes would not need to be made in every constituency as just a few alterations would result in matters going radically wrong.</P>
      <P>The Government is proposing a fig leaf of an independent panel, while at the same time expressing its intention to press ahead with the full implementation of electronic voting in the local and European elections. If the Government was serious about the views of independent experts and the concerns of ordinary people and those who intend to vote, it would have produced a Green Paper and a White Paper and would now suspend its plans for electronic voting in June. Its belated amendment is an admission that it has failed to convince the political parties and the <Col N="87"/>public that its chosen system of electronic voting can be relied on. Instead of facing up to its failure, it is trying to fudge its way out of the mess in which it has landed itself.</P>
      <P>Last December, Margaret McGaley, a respected academic and authority on electronic voting told the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government:</P>
      <P LI="1">The introduction of electronic voting in Ireland, in its current form, threatens the integrity of our democracy. As demonstrated in the report before us, this is an issue that has been incompetently addressed by the Government. The cost of the development of a suitable system, and whether the potential advantages would justify that cost, remain undiscussed.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Government will argue that the electronic voting machine will produce a paper trail, which is the case, but only on foot of a High Court petition. One can work this backwards. It is pointless having the machine produce 1,000 paper trails on foot of High Court petitions if the system has been tampered with or is not tamper proof in the first instance because it will produce the wrong kind of paper trail in all cases. At least with the current system, one can store the ballot boxes in a hayshed, whereas with the new system they must be stored in electronically controlled, humidified conditions. As well as the cost involved, the machines must be checked for security, public liability and much else on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated yesterday that he knows about software, this country knows about it as it is one of its leading producers and it is important that things are checked. It is a long time since the by-election when the late, lamented Willie O'Brien arrived at a school in north Mayo to find the presiding officer with his Wellingtons covered in whitewash, having painted the slogan &ldquo;Vote Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo; on the roof of the polling station. It is important that things are checked and are trusted.</P>
      <P>If the Government tampers with the voting system without acquiring the trust of the political parties and the people, it will not be allowed to forget it. It would be political sacrilege to proceed and I urge the Ministers of State to carry the message to their senior Ministers that the proposals be deferred, expenditure on them cease, and an independent commission and a verifiable audit trail established. The technological questions which were asked should also be answered and we should have a full-scale discussion of the issue.</P>
      <P>The Government must stop this nonsense and address the issue of sustaining the integrity of and the credibility in a system which has stood the country well, through thick and thin, tension and controversy and public debate. At least the current process was verifiable throughout, for good or ill; the Government's plan is not.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="88"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Kenny tabled this motion, which my party is happy to support. It has already succeeded in flushing out the division and unease within and between the Government parties and has forced a climbdown by the Government. It is, however, only a partial climbdown when the critical issue of the verifiable vote audit trail remains unresolved. When I referred to my support for the motion, I must be honest and state that, if left to my own devices, I would probably go a good deal further than the motion proposes.</P>
      <P>It is not fashionable to declare oneself hostile to any aspect of new technology but, at the risk of being unfashionable, I consider this project one of the greatest wastes of money this Government has undertaken, which is to say something. We are in the process of spending &euro;40 million to fix something which is not broken, based on no demand for change, no evaluation of flaws within the current system and no indication that the current system has ever produced anything but fair results. We need to spend a considerable sum of money on encouraging people to vote in the numbers to which we were accustomed. We need to engage in educational programmes to re-instil the value of a vote in citizens who have become disillusioned and alienated from electoral politics.</P>
      <P>All of this has come about without the House ever being permitted to focus on the issues thrown up by the electronic voting and counting system. Far more importantly, we need to fix politics. The deceit and broken promises that are the great legacy of this Government from the last election, coupled with the venality, corruption and fraud that have been the enduring legacy of some politicians, have done more than the voting system could ever do to alienate voters.</P>
      <P>If we cannot take the steps necessary to restore trust in the political process, all the glossy high-tech machines and all the advertising campaigns in the world will not lure voters back into the polling booths. Instead of becoming serious about the need to restore trust, the Government decides to install a system of counting votes that people simply do not trust. It is hard to imagine a more hapless response to the increasing malaise in the practice of politics at every level.</P>
      <P>The Government has now essentially admitted that its entire proposal is in a shambles. For weeks I have been asking the Taoiseach to set out the legal underpinning for electronic voting and counting. Every time I have asked the question I have received a different answer. He has written to me on occasion to say he was wrong. Statutory instruments were necessary, then they were not and then they were again. It has been a little like the Fianna F&aacute;il Party version of Lanigan's Ball. Now at the last minute, the Government states that primary legislation is needed. One must wonder if it ever obtained legal advice on this matter before settling on the current legal fiasco.</P><Col N="89"/>
      <P>What is the legislation for? According to the Government amendment, its purpose, among other matters, is to set up an independent body to oversee the system of electronic voting but not, critically, the electronic counting. The amendment carefully refers to electronic voting and counting in several places but omits any reference to counting where the remit of the so-called independent commissioner is concerned. One can only assume it remains the Government's intention that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's director of elections, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will remain in charge of the counting.</P>
      <P>Whatever reason we had to be suspicious before, we have twice the reason now. I said earlier that the Government had done only one thing but in fact it has done two. A substantial part of the &euro;40 million will be spent on an advertising campaign run and co-ordinated by people who have been and remain very close to Fianna F&aacute;il. That in itself raises serious issues of propriety. There is no proposal in the amendment that the independent commission will take responsibility for the advertising and public relations campaign now under way. It can be guaranteed that the vast bulk of that money will be well spent and the enormous fees invoiced and paid long before the independent commission is up and running.</P>
      <P>If this matter were handled in this fashion by any other party in this House and if the crony contracts were disbursed in this fashion, Fianna F&aacute;il in Opposition would create uproar. From what I have seen of the advertising campaign so far, it seems to rely on the basic assumption that all of us are technological illiterates who need to be reassured that the machines will not bite us when we enter the polling station. If we can flick on a light switch we will apparently find the machines user-friendly. I do not know how many times I have heard it said over the years that this is the most sophisticated electorate in the world. We are used to using a relatively complex system of single transferable voting to express often elaborate and far-reaching preferences. Our economy is sold all over the world as the one with the most highly educated and adaptable workforce, computer literate and skilled in every aspect of production but we have to be told in a campaign that will cost millions that we should not be afraid to touch a computer screen. In short, the public relations campaign on which the Government is content to spend all this money is an insult to the intelligence of the people.</P>
      <P>If the so-called independent commission is established with enough independence to venture a recommendation &mdash; I do not know if Mr. P. J. Mara and others are available to serve &mdash; especially a recommendation that not enough has been done to generate public trust, what will the Government do then? By the time the commission is established, we will be a few weeks <Col N="90"/>away from the local and European elections. How can any such body undertake the necessary task of restoring trust in a process that has been so damaged by the activities of the Government in so short a time? This is especially the case when the Government excludes from any consideration the possibility of ensuring that there is a paper trail, a proper basis on which dubious outcomes can be challenged. How can the commission function as anything other than a fig leaf for Government?</P>
      <P>The Government's PR campaign is an insult to the intelligence of the people but there is a deeper insult. Last week the courts were left with no choice but to send a brain-damaged, deeply disturbed boy to jail, the worst possible environment for him, because we cannot afford the commitment of resources to build a better environment. Yet, without thinking twice about it, &euro;40 million can be poured down the drain to put electronic voting in place.</P>
      <P>Tonight the Minister will repeat the mantra that the Oireachtas decided to implement electronic voting. The Oireachtas decided no such thing. In 2001, this House discussed a Bill that would enable electronic voting to be introduced by ministerial order. The Labour Party and the other Opposition parties voted against the Bill, although it should be recorded that our focus was the spending limits in the same Bill. As so frequently happens, the House was not afforded time on Committee Stage to deal with the electronic voting enabling provision. However, as the Bill passed was an enabling one, no fair-minded person could conclude that it confers authority on the Government to put electronic voting in place without any further consultation. As Deputy Kenny has noted, only yesterday, the Taoiseach defended the Government's proposals on electronic voting and said that it must be all right as he stated, &ldquo;After all, Ireland is one of the largest exporters of software in the world&rdquo;. The implication is, therefore, that this software must be a good thing.</P>
      <P>Of all the defences of electronic voting I have heard, this was the most puzzling. There is no connection whatever between the subject of electronic voting and the export of software and what is more, despite being the largest exporter of software in the world, we are importing all the software necessary for this project. Not only are we importing it, but as I understand, the entire basis of the software will remain a commercial, proprietary secret.</P>
      <P>Article 45 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 guarantees to every citizen the right and opportunity &ldquo;to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors&rdquo;. The requirement that the elections be genuine means that the entire electoral process, as Deputy <Col N="91"/>Kenny has said, should be open, transparent and trustworthy.</P>
      <P>The declaration of the council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the criteria for free and fair elections, dated 26 March 1994, also states, &ldquo;Furthermore, state authorities should ensure that the ballot is conducted so as to avoid fraud or other illegality, that the security and the integrity is maintained and that ballot counting is undertaken by trained personnel, subject to monitoring and-or impartial verification.&rdquo; It further states, &ldquo;States should take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure the transparency of the entire electoral process including, for example, through the presence of party agents and duly accredited observers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the Government's task to reassure the people that all these criteria are met under its proposed electronic voting system. The more it blusters, the more I am convinced that it has something to hide. Frankly, when it comes to counting the votes, I do not trust Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>The Labour Party has studied the proposed electronic voting system in depth. We published a detailed report on the Government's proposed system last November. Since then a wide variety of technical experts have all expressed the same doubts about the system. Most of them have focused on the one salient fact on which the Government is silent in the amendment published today, namely, the fact that under the system proposed by the Government, the voter has no way of being certain that the vote which he or she casts is accurately recorded by the voting machine and that software is thereafter not over-ridden by a corruption of the count centre software. The voter is expected to have blind trust in the technology.</P>
      <P>Who can have blind trust in this Government? It has broken every promise it made before the election. It has emasculated the freedom of information legislation; it has constantly sought to do away with spending limits in elections and the need to account for spending and it is seeking to put structures in place that will facilitate the politicisation and break-up of the Civil Service. The last thing this Government should be trusted with is counting votes. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing Fine Gael time on this joint Opposition motion. It is constructive that the issue of electronic voting which applies to every voter regardless of political view be dealt with on a cross-party basis. The former Minister of State at the then Department of the Environment and Local Government, Mr. Bobby Molloy, made it clear in the Seanad that a consensus was required if this <Col N="92"/>system of electronic voting was to be agreed upon and was to enjoy the confidence of the public.</P>
      <P>There are a number of technical issues relating to the Nedap-Powervote system which has been imported by the Government. Many IT professionals in Ireland and abroad have expressed concern about the system. These issues can be discussed later but I believe it would be more productive for the House to focus on the single solution to many of the problems and which has been adopted recently by the State of California.</P>
      <P>The Nedap-Powervote system as proposed does not provide verifiability as the voter has no way of knowing whether the machine has recorded the vote as the voter intended. This is an important point as the voter must have complete faith in the accuracy of the vote recording and counting. Voters must have no doubts about the system and they must know that the system is foolproof.</P>
      <P>The system used in the United States of America is not the same as the proposed system, but the example of the American presidential election in 2000 provides a lesson in what can happen and what could be the remedy. The electronic voting system in Precinct 216 in Velusia County in Florida, recorded that Al Gore had received minus 16,022 votes. Some 412 of the 583 registered voters had cast their votes but the computer system was showing 2,813 votes for George W. Bush, minus 16,022 for Al Gore and an even bigger negative vote for the Green candidate, Ralph Nader. The system used in Precinct 216 is similar to the system we use for the national lottery. The canvassing board was able to use a manual record of the votes cast for the recount. Such a recount, based on an original record of the voter's intention, is not possible under the Nedap-Powervote system. The Nedap-Powervote manual recount procedures are based on what the computer has recorded as the voter's intention, which is not the same thing.</P>
     
      <P>The secretary of state in California, Mr. Kevin Shelley, announced recently that from 1 July 2005 counties will be unable to purchase voting machines that do not produce a paper trail. From July 2006, all voting machines will have to offer a voter verifiable paper audit trail, regardless of when they were purchased. California, which all Members will agree is the home of high technology, has been using automated voting systems for many years. It is incumbent on us, surely, to learn from its experiences, to avoid making the mistakes made there and to use state-of-the-art technology from the outset. Such technology will not be used in full in California until July 2006.</P>
      <Miles par="113" com="cl"/><P>I would like to quote from the relevant comments of Mr. Warren Slocum, the elections chief of San Mateo county, after Mr. Shelley's announcement was made. He said that &ldquo;election integrity is absolutely a fundamental requirement of our democracy&rdquo; and that the voter verifiable <Col N="93"/>paper audit trail &ldquo;is one step toward strengthening that and giving voters confidence that their vote was handled by the computer in the way they wanted it to be handled&rdquo;. In response to other state election officials who said that providing paper receipts would increase the county's costs, Mr. Slocum replied:</P>
      <P LI="1">Democracy ain't cheap. It's true we have a fiscal crisis and it's going to cost money, but what is the cost of blowing an election? What's the cost to the community to have a candidate who believes they lost an election because they believe the computer didn't count the votes correctly?</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am sure the Minister is aware that we know of 400 instances of votes not being counted correctly by the electronic system used in certain places in the second referendum on the Nice treaty. The electoral authority personnel in California, which is the home of Silicon Valley, have years of practical experience of using voting machines. When such people tell us that the system has flaws and that a manual record verified by the voter is a necessity, we should listen closely to them.</P>
      <P>I accept that some minor issues will need to be resolved if the system I propose is to work. The argument that voter privacy will be compromised is a red herring and a bogus excuse. The handling of manual votes will be as private and as secure as the existing manual system that has served us well for decades. Given that other jurisdictions have succeeded in implementing voter verified e-voting systems, it is a fudge to say that it cannot be done. To say that it will mean a loss of privacy is a red herring and to say that there is no need for it is plain arrogance. When one speaks about privacy, it is important to remember that the paper system was never private for blind people, who had to bring somebody with them to the polling station to vote on their behalf. Despite the improved technology being used in the proposed e-voting system, it will not provide any additional privacy for blind people.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be no Braille and there is no proposal to make changes in that regard.</P>
      <P>I would like to make some points about the technical issues. It has been mentioned that the Nedap-Powervote software is proprietary and that the source code is not available for public scrutiny. There is a possibility that there are flaws somewhere in the 200,000 lines of code, or that the code could be open to manipulation. These instances have occurred in the USA and came to light only when internal e-mails from within the software company were inadvertently made public.</P>
      <P>A different approach has been taken in the Australian system, which was introduced in six <Col N="94"/>months, rather than over four years. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, it cost 10 million Australian dollars, rather than the &euro;35 million we have spent here, a figure which increases to &euro;40 million when one includes the cost of publicity contracts. The system designed in Australia two years ago addressed and eased most of the common concerns. Those running the Australian system chose to make their software completely open to public scrutiny. Although a private Australian company designed the system, it was based on specifications set by independent election officials, who posted the code on the Internet for all to see and evaluate. It was accomplished from concept to product in six months and it went through a trial run in a state election in 2001. The public was able to download the software and to proof it for problems, bugs or backdoors. A number of people found problems, including an academic at the Australian National University who found the most serious problem.</P>
      <P>The Australian system is based on open source software, as opposed to the Nedap-Powervote system and the American system mentioned previously, both of which use Microsoft Access. I discussed this issue with an IT professional recently and I outlined the Nedap-Powervote system to him in layman's terms. When I told him that the system uses Microsoft Access he laughed and told me that I was wrong. He was adamant that nobody in their right mind would use Microsoft Access for such a critical application, but when I assured him that I was correct, his reply was unrepeatable. I understand that a number of people have made this point to the Department, although I expect that their point was more eloquently put. The IT professional told me that the EU is actively promoting the use of open source software for mission critical applications. It is the preferred development environment for governmental applications across the EU, primarily for reasons of cost, suitability and security. I suggest that we bear this in mind in Ireland if we have to go back to the drawing board on this project.</P>
      <P>Like justice, the democratic and electoral processes must be conducted in public. Before the public can have confidence in the voting system, it is critical that the IT community has confidence in it. The Nedap-Powervote system relies on secret software, secret processes and a general lack of transparency. The history of such systems in other jurisdictions proves that it is not acceptable to proceed without a voter verifiable paper audit trail. We should learn from the experience of other people, by developing a state-of-the-art e-voting system. I would prefer if this could be done in Ireland, as we should try to keep jobs in Ireland. We should learn from the experience of other countries and thereby avoid the problems they had with their first generation systems. We should take the best-in-class systems from Australia and California and make our <Col N="95"/>system the best in the world, based on their experience. We have spent a considerable sum of money on this project &mdash; many people would say that we have wasted it. We should ensure that we get it right first time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will be familiar with the business magazine <i>Fortune</i>, which recently declared that paperless voting was the worst technology of 2003. It is important to stress that such a system is not used nationwide in any other European state, contrary to the claims of many people. When the Taoiseach offers an independent body, he is simply offering the equivalent of a cup of cocoa. When one compares his offer to the action taken in the US state of Maryland, where people were hired to see if they could break the e-voting system by hacking into it, it is by no means an assurance. People in this country need such reassurance, especially if the new system is to be spearheaded by Fianna F&aacute;il. If the Government was convinced of the merits of its technology, there is no doubt that it would copy the Maryland example and provide for a voter verifiable audit trail, rather than trying to hide behind weak arguments that have no basis in science.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. The Minister is abroad on EU Presidency duties at the conference of the parties to the biodiversity convention, but he has been in communication with the Cabinet about this debate.</P>
      <P>Much has been written and said about electronic voting and counting in the last few weeks by politicians, computer experts, media commentators and opinion columnists. Comments have ranged from the well-informed and well-intentioned to the actively mischievous and misleading. Ill-informed comment is not unusual in public debate on reforms in this country. Certain Members on the other side of the House have jealously guarded their position at the forefront in this regard. Hardly a week goes by without them announcing loudly that they have discovered another dark conspiracy against the people. The leader of the Labour Party is normally the accepted champion in this field, but this debate has brought out the claims of a <Col N="97"/>number of other Deputies. It is clear from this evening's contribution by Deputy Rabbitte that the Labour Party is not interested in seeking safeguards for electronic voting. The Labour Party's approach is that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted. This is an insidious, unworthy, diabolical and appalling attempt to create doubt where there is no doubt.</P>

	<P>Having heard the opening attacks of the Opposition, there is no doubt that the Fine Gael Party's motion has nothing to do with genuine concerns that our electoral system is in danger. The Opposition parties know that this system has already been used without complaint 70 million times. The Opposition knows that the system has been independently verified and that it will continue to be run by the same people who have always run it.</P>

	<P>This will be the most accurate and, therefore, the most democratic system we have ever had. However, the Opposition parties are committed to an era of total opposition in that everything the Government does is to be opposed in a shrill and hysterical way. Tonight, the Opposition parties have united in support of the Fine Gael Party's motion in yet another example of their united cynicism and opportunism.</P>

	<P>The Opposition is correct that changes in the electoral system are best when they are based on political consensus. However, it has demonstrated how it will withdraw that consensus for short-term tactical advantage. This was not always the case.</P><Col N="98"/>
      <P>When the D&aacute;il first passed the enabling legislation for this improved system, many Opposition Deputies said that the Government was not going far enough in that a move to Internet voting should be examined too. In the midst of this diversionary fog thrown up by the Opposition, some basic points must be made clear. The introduction of the system has not been rushed. Instead, it has taken place in easy steps over a number of years. The system has been independently verified as safe and reliable.</P>

	<P>The electronic voting and counting project is not about change for the sake of change or technology for the sake of technology. Its fundamental purpose is to improve the efficiency, speed, accuracy and user-friendliness of elections and to eliminate the democratic wastage associated with spoilt votes. There were more than 20,000 in the 2002 general election, equivalent to 1.1% of all votes. It is more than just improving the technology. By modernising and transforming elections in a visible way, it creates the opportunity for tackling voter apathy and improving the image of elections, especially for an increasingly younger electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Electronic voting will deliver to voters and political practitioners a higher level of service and a high class, modernised voting and counting system. The Government believes that, subject to rigorous testing and due diligence, these benefits should be delivered as quickly as possible to the people. This progress should not be delayed to the public and certainly not on account of conspiracy theories or ideological opposition to electronic voting.</P>

	<P>With regard to the election management software an independent Irish software firm, Nathean Technologies, has undertaken a comprehensive architectural code review of the election software. It has concluded that the code does not contain elements which <Col N="101"/>can corrupt the correct running of the software. As a further precaution, all the computers to be used in the election will be stand-alone machines and, therefore, will not be accessible by the Internet or networks.</P>
      <P>The computers will be &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; to remove or deactivate any software that is superfluous to the running of the election and will only be accessed and activated by use of a security smart card, held by the returning officer, and an individual PIN number. In addition, the Electoral Reform Services in the UK has tested the PR single transferable vote count rules against its database of more than 400 STV elections to ensure that the rules have been precisely applied.</P>

	<P>Regarding the security of the voting machines and the protocols surrounding the election, the Department has introduced rigorous procedures for secure storage and maintenance throughout polling.</P>
      <P>On foot of a comprehensive security assessment, which was undertaken on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by Zerflow Information Security, several additional measures were introduced following the initial pilot elections to address any concerns regarding access to the system. Seals will be placed over the ballot modules in the voting machines and the ballot papers will be locked in the display with access only by the returning officer. Once the voting machines are formally tested to ensure that the correct data has been loaded onto it and that all the buttons work, the voting machine will be sealed to ensure that no unauthorised access is permitted. Following these improvements, Zerflow has confirmed that its concerns have all been satisfactorily addressed. The Opposition loves to quote the first Zerflow report, but lacks the good grace to acknowledge that these concerns have been addressed.</P>
      <P>In addition to the six independent companies which carried out the broad range of tests on the voting hardware and software and all security procedures and aspects of the system, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is working closely with returning officers to ensure stringent security and procedural safeguards.</P>

	<P>While our present system has worked well, one does not hear the same alarm stories about the security of the paper ballot and the possibilities that exist to interfere with such a box. It would be much easier for votes to be compromised or lost with a paper ballot. The electronic system has proved to be totally dependable through its record over the years in <Col N="102"/>other countries and in our pilot polls. That is the acid test: successful use at a real election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fundamentally false premise of the Opposition and other critics that we are somehow losing a perfect system. Anyone who attends counts knows that this is not the case. By far the most important part of this is that thousands of people go to the polls and cast a ballot which they think is valid but which is ruled out because of an inadvertent error.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not some hypothetical possibility, it is what happens every time we use the traditional system which almost certainly impacts on the results of elections. In the last local elections 24,000 people had their votes disallowed, overwhelmingly because of inadvertent errors such as indistinct numerals or a failure to properly stamp the ballot. Meanwhile 40 councillors were returned by less than 50 votes. In the Borris-in-Ossory area there was a tie for the final seat but at the same time ballots had been ruled out because of simple human errors. On the same day, over 45,000 votes were ruled out in the European elections, mainly because voters had mistakenly continued numbering between the different ballot papers. Anyone who has been at a close recount has seen ballots held up to the light to check if the perforation has gone through. In the 21st century. there must be a better way of doing things.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a proven case available to us which will end this flaw in our democratic system, adopting it is not an option, it is essential for all true democrats. Every vote should be accurately counted and every mandate should reflect the exact intent of those who have taken the time to participate. This is exactly what the new system will achieve. By the way, the manner in which we transfer surpluses to subsequent counts is not correct and does not give a true reflection of the vote but the computer system will do that.</P>

	<P>At the last election when only a certain number of constituencies used this system and the others used the traditional system that was how it worked. Under the new system, however, it will be possible for the ballot to be counted throughout the country in the same way and the correct way.</P>

	<P>Returning officers will apply rigid access security procedures at all stages of the election so that only authorised staff will have access to the stand-alone voting machines and the PCs used at the election. Some security concerns have been raised about the use of PCs. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has had the arrangements for the PCs checked with experts from two leading companies in the PC and software industry and they expressed satisfaction with arrangements. The new election-specific PCs to be supplied to returning officers will have been specially security hardened with only the software necessary for the election loaded on them. This means that it will not be possible to load other software on the PCs during the election period. Only staff authorised by the returning officer will have access to a PC and there will be specific security access procedures to log in to the PCs. The PCs will also be under the control and direction of the returning officers at all times. Neither the voting machines nor PCs will be linked to any network, internally or externally, so that hacking and virus attack will not be possible.</P>

	<P>Like the D&aacute;il system</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal specifically with the two issues raised by some opponents of the system. The first issue is that of adding on a voter verifiable paper audit trail, or VVPAT. I have observed an increasing chorus for what has become a media catchword but I wonder do its proponents understand the system we are using or are they just accepting, uncritically, the information made available by some individuals? The proponents of a VVPAT come mostly from the US and their concerns arise in the context of the voting machines used in that country. However, it is important to understand that there are many different types of voting machines in use in the US, some good, some not so good. The Nedap machine is not of the same type as those in the US. We need to be realistic and compare like with like. People should not accept everything that is put before them on this issue without regard to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="104"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. We should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be guided by the voting machine's past use and reliability both here and in other countries and its testing by internationally accredited testing agencies. The following matters are relevant: the US voting machines in question are generally PC-based; the Nedap voting machine is a proprietary product manufactured specifically for voting. Our counting system alone will be PC-based. The Nedap machine has been used for many years in other countries without any uncertainty as to its reliability. The machine, including software for storing votes, has been tested and certified as accurately storing votes as cast by the voter. The ballot paper is visible on the voting machine screen. The voter sees the preference number beside the candidate's details and the preference details are visible on the bottom line of the voting machine display screen as the voter records preferences on the machine. Details are confirmed or may be amended before the &ldquo;Cast Vote&rdquo; button is pressed. Printers are unreliable, especially in a high volume situation. Must voting be suspended if a printer breaks down during polling day? If some of the voters do not have a paper copy the rechecking objective is negated.</P>
      <P>In California a task force which considered this matter and included representatives of the electronic industry and election officials could not reach a consensus on the use of a VVPAT and highlighted technical problems with the use of printers as a major obstacle. The control unit operator can confirm that a vote is stored and the number of votes stored can be checked on the control unit screen. Ballot papers printed at the time of voting and used in a manual count later would not give the same precise result as the electronic count due to the &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; of ballot papers. This would negate one of the main reasons for a VVPAT, a point acknowledged by the Labour Party in its report on electronic voting. While there has been much debate about the use of VVPAT in the US, no such system is in use. This is certainly true of California where the debate has been hottest.</P>
      <P>There is a formal legal audit trail if such is needed. If there is an election petition the High Court, or the Circuit Court in the case of a local election, can require the system to print a ballot paper for each vote cast, after the mixing of the ballot, thus enabling a manual count to be conducted. It is reasonable to rely on the proven record of the system in other countries and the certification by international testing institutes, rather than over-reacting to some doubts raised about entirely different types of PC-based voting machines used in the US. Trying to compare the two systems is like comparing apples and oranges but this is exactly what the Opposition is asking us to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that he will review the question of making the source code <Col N="105"/>available to the public, having regard to the security of the system and secrecy of the ballot. Very few countries make election source code publicly available because of security concerns. We have adopted a sensible and phased approach to introducing electronic voting. The proposal has been in the public domain since 1999 so we can hardly be accused of rushing it. We have successfully piloted the system at real polls. It is now time to move on having secured a trustworthy system and validated and verified its ability to store and count votes securely. In rolling it out the approach was to use an electronic voting system of proven and robust performance. We have procured a system that comes with its own proprietary hardware and software and enjoyed the proven advantage of wide-scale and successful use in other democracies. Its use in some of the most sophisticated societies in the world is the most worthwhile possible test of reliability.</P>
      <P>In introducing electronic voting, the Government is conscious of the need to make continuous service improvements to the operation of the system. For example, since the successful pilots we have increased the visibility and legibility of the voting machines. Similarly, where other issues arise which may cause concern the Government is happy to deal with these as far as possible. The Government accepts the need to ensure that there is utmost confidence in our electoral systems. Therefore, in response to the concerns raised, on the proposal of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government has decided to establish an independent panel to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the arrangements proposed for electronic voting. This panel will be established on a statutory basis but it is proposed to appoint on a non-statutory basis in advance of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o'clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Questions have been raised about the validity of using an order under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 to apply electronic voting for local and European elections. A reading of Part 3 of the Act clearly shows that it was the intention of the Oireachtas to provide for the application of electronic voting to other than D&aacute;il elections. Part 3 has already been used without challenge to provide for electronic voting in the second Nice treaty referendum. In addition, in drafting the legislation, the Government was conscious of previous court rulings on the use of secondary legislation. However, as promised, the Government has further consulted the Attorney General on the matter and has decided to introduce primary legislation to eliminate any legal doubts regarding the application of electronic voting in the forthcoming local and European elections. The legislation will be brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the near future.</P><Col N="106"/>
      <P>In bringing forward this legislation, the opportunity will also be taken to develop more explicit provisions regarding abstention from voting and to specify conditions under which tally data may be made available from the electronic counting system to interested parties. These last provisions will further enhance the transparency of the system and build confidence in it. It could, for example, allow a specific percentage of votes from any given unit, for example, the electoral area or polling station. It would also be proposed to retain an overriding discretion for the presiding officer to prohibit the disclosure of votes in a given unit where there would be a risk that individual voters could be identified.</P>
      <P>The move to electronic voting and counting demonstrates a progressive and modern Ireland. Increasingly, people use electronic means for conducting their lives and electronic interfaces between Government and citizen are becoming more commonplace. Change is part of the human condition and change in the way we vote is an inevitable part of our ever-changing world. The majority of people understand and react well to change. In a different context, the smooth introduction of the euro is a recent positive experience. Those voters who have had an electronic voting experience in Ireland have had a good one and I am confident that voters in the European and local elections will do likewise on 11 June next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>Members on all sides of the House welcomed the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, the provisions of which allowed for the introduction of electronic voting. However, there has been a sea change in the past few weeks with the main Opposition parties now casting some doubts on the safety and security of electronic voting.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of this proposal is to improve the efficiency, speed, accuracy and user-friendliness of elections and to eliminate the waste associated with spoiled votes. It is not just about improving technology. By modernising and transforming elections in a visible way, the opportunity is created to tackle voter apathy and to improve the image of elections, particularly among young voters who are staying away in droves from casting their votes.</P>
      <P>In introducing electronic voting, the Government has brought in a system of proven performance. The system chosen has enjoyed the advantage of widescale and successful use at national and local elections in the Netherlands over many years. It was more recently employed <Col N="107"/>in some German municipal elections and it is now being introduced in France. Surely if some of the most sophisticated societies in the world have confidence in this system, there is no reason we should not be confident to use it here.</P>
      <P>I am sure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, remember what happened in our constituency not too long ago when a complete ballot box was mislaid. Only for the fact that it was the third day of a recount, who knows if that box would have come to the notice of the public and, more importantly, the candidates. If we were proposing to change from electronic to manual voting, I can imagine the outcry from certain quarters. They would be talking about the volumes of paper which would have to be counted and transferred overnight from various locations and about the safety and integrity of counters in the counting halls and centres. The Government's proposal is correct and timely.</P>
      <P>The new voting system was extensively piloted at the 2002 general election and in the last Nice treaty referendum. The reaction of users has been overwhelmingly positive. No significant complaints were made about it by the candidates or by those using it. All best technologies embrace the principle of continuous improvement. The Government is committed to the continuous improvement of the electronic voting system. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government are working on changes to the presentation of results. Some improvements are necessary in that area, given what we saw at the last general election. The Government has modified the voting machines to make them more user-friendly and accessible. It has also subjected and continues to subject the system's software and hardware to rigorous testing by a range of independent agencies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's initiative today to establish an independent panel to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the arrangements proposed for electronic voting. The Government completely understands and agrees with the need to ensure the utmost confidence in our electoral system. I hope the Opposition recognises that by doing that, the Government is going some way towards addressing many of the concerns raised by those people who expressed reservations about electronic voting. However, the approach seems to be one of political point-scoring and of deliberately undermining the widespread public acceptance which electronic voting has built up in seven constituencies where it has been piloted. Some doubts were expressed about the adoption of primary legislation by ministerial order. I, therefore, welcome the fact that the Government is introducing legislation to eliminate legal doubts about the application of electronic voting in the forthcoming local and European elections.</P>
      <P>We cannot forget the considerable imperfections of the old ballot paper system, <Col N="108"/>which typically wasted more than 1% of votes cast through spoiled votes. The feelings of assurance and validation, which some claim for the paper ballot process, were not, at least for some voters, justifiable. The manual count was also subject to errors and risks. Many colleagues in all parties in this House had to suffer long, nail-biting counts for results which often hinged on a small number of spoiled votes. I am sure many of us will be glad to see the end of those days. For those reasons, I am confident the electronic system will prove an easier, quicker and more accessible and accurate voting system for the people. I support the Government's amendment.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government's amendment invites us to recall the approval by the Oireachtas of the legislative provisions for electronic voting and counting set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001. I accept that invitation and recall what happened in 2001 because since this debate went into the public domain the Government has been spinning a line to the effect that all this was agreed. It wants to know what the Opposition is complaining about because it agreed to it. It was repeated again in the speech by the Minister for Finance this evening that the opposition to electronic voting is politically motivated.</P>
      <P>I want to demonstrate that we did not agree to it in 2001 and we do not agree to it now. The Second Stage debate on the Bill, which contained a number of other provisions, including the raising of spending limits by Fianna F&aacute;il for the last election, began in the House on 22 June 2001. The Labour Party and the other Opposition parties which tabled this motion tonight opposed that Bill on Second Stage. In the course of my contribution, I stated: &ldquo;The proposal for electronic voting in the Bill is a sham.&rdquo; I later stated: &ldquo;It appears the process of voting will be more complicated and, ultimately, it will be open to error.&rdquo; All the Opposition parties voted against the Second Stage of that Bill on 26 June 2001. The Bill commenced Committee Stage on 28 June. It was a limited Committee Stage debate as the Government guillotined proceedings. Nevertheless, for a limited period we discussed electronic voting. Again we opposed the sections of the Bill proposing the introduction of electronic voting. During that debate I stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The introduction of electronic voting in the form proposed in this Bill is premature. We are creating a system which, with the best will in the world. will be open to error. It is not yet refined.</P>
      <P FLI="0">When the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="109"/>Government, former Deputy Molloy, told us that a Dutch and British company Nedap-Powervote had already been chosen the previous December to deliver an electronic system for Ireland, I went on to state:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am greatly alarmed by the Government's identification of a supplier of equipment for electronic voting before the legislation permitting electronic voting has been enacted by the Oireachtas. Have any contractual arrangements been entered into or any costs incurred? If so, on what authority was this done as no legislation allowing electronic voting has been passed?</P>
      <P FLI="0">In conclusion I proposed that &ldquo;no equipment should be approved until a full technical description of that equipment, and all information relating to it and to independent testing, is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the order is passed.&rdquo; It seems that in principle we are going ahead with electronic voting and the Minister kindly outlined the different phases and stages proposed. It should be applied only with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The introduction of this in individual constituencies or generally should not be left to ministerial order. We are talking here about major changes in the practice of voting and the Houses of the Oireachtas should give the approval.</P>
      <P>When the Bill reached Report Stage on 5 July 2001, the Opposition voted against it on three occasions. We voted against a Government proposal to guillotine the debate. I proposed a motion that the entire Bill be recommitted to Committee because inadequate time had been provided for examining its details. Again the Government voted that down. Finally at 6 o'clock that evening we voted against the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to regard that as having given some kind of tacit approval to the introduction of the primary legislation for electronic voting. However, we agreed that trials could take place in a number of constituencies in the general election and subsequently in the second referendum on the Nice treaty. However, when concerns began to be raised particularly by IT experts, we again raised the matter in the House. On 17 June 2003, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, the study conducted in NUI Maynooth by Margaret McGaley and others. I asked him about the implications of that study for electronic voting. In the course of my contribution I asked the Minister:</P>
      <P LI="1">How can he say to these people [those whose children have disabilities] that there is no funding for these services, yet the Government is prepared to spend &euro;45 million on a system of electronic voting which has been established as being unsafe, insecure, with no traceability, no transparency and which frankly is unnecessary?</P><Col N="110"/>
      <P FLI="0">Following that the Labour Party published a report produced for us by a number of IT experts in which we identified a number of serious concerns with electronic voting, in particular the absence of a paper trail that could be audited. We stated that while individual components had been tested, the entire system had not been tested end to end. We made the case for the introduction of electronic voting to be given to an independent body and we suggested the Public Offices Commission might be the appropriate body.</P>
      <P>I joined Deputy Allen in having the matter examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. However the Government amendment to tonight's motion calls on us to recognise &ldquo;the recent endorsement of the introduction of electronic voting and counting at the June 2004 polls by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government&rdquo;. I will relate what happened at that committee meeting.</P>
      <P>A number of experts, Joe McCarthy, Margaret McGaley, Shane Hogan and Robert Cochran, gave evidence before the committee, in which they raised serious questions about the operation of electronic voting. That committee did not get time to fully examine and tease out those questions because the Government members of the committee proposed a motion, which effectively shut down the discussion and debate. Amazingly, two days later the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government signed its contract with the companies providing the equipment.</P>
      <P>In the Government amendment, we are asked to recall &ldquo;the Government's open declaration in October 2002 of their intention to roll out electronic voting countrywide for the European and local elections in June 2004&rdquo;. Governing by declaration is what dictators do. Governing by consensus, seeking agreement and approval in a parliamentary assembly is what one expects in a democracy. While the Government may indeed have declared its intention in 2002 to use electronic voting in the local and European elections, it never got approval from this House for it. At the very least it was required to put regulations before the House for its approval. That was not done. The Government now accepts and acknowledges that it is required to put not only regulations before the House, but also primary legislation. That has not yet been done. On what basis has the Government proceeded to spend more than &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money on a system for the introduction of which it had no approval from this House?</P>
      <P>The Government first committed itself to the companies to provide this system in September 2000 before the legislation enabling the introduction of electronic voting was even published, much less debated in the House or given approval. The Government has spent &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money illegally and it is a <Col N="111"/>subject to which this House will have to return at a later stage.</P>
      <P>It is now proposed to establish what is called &ldquo;an independent panel&rdquo; to verify the secrecy, etc. of the voting system. That is not an adequate response to what we seek. It does not deal with the critical issue of the establishment of a paper trail to give confidence to the individual voter that his or her voting intention in the election is accurately recorded in the system. It does not address the question of the use of this electronic system in the forthcoming local and European elections. If we are now in an area of doubt legally, financially and technically over the system, it is prudent that this system not be used universally in the European and local elections in June. While there may be a case for some kind of extended trial, it should certainly not be used in this way.</P>
      <P>We are in this situation because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Government colleagues would not listen to what the Opposition has been saying over the past three years and, specifically, would not listen to the valid and serious criticisms raised about this system by IT experts in recent months. Even at this late stage the Government should think again, put off the universal extension of this in June and introduce the paper trail we seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is the product of the insolence of office. The D&aacute;il has become a rubber stamp and now the Government, which has been in office far too long, expects the people to become a rubber stamp. I am disturbed to hear Government spokespersons and backbenchers talk about the Opposition raising issues about this matter. What do they think our job is if it is not to raise issues? This is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House in my time as a Member. It is extremely important legislation. If former Deputy Des O'Malley were in the House, he would stand by the Republic in decrying how this legislation has been rammed through this House.</P>
      <P>A Green Paper should have been published setting out the alternatives available followed by a White Paper after a consultation process into which the public had an opportunity for input. At the very least, there should have been cross-party agreement in the House about the necessity of changing the way people register their votes. Is there anything more important in a democracy? Did people die in the GPO, giving their lives towards building up this democracy, so that some Minister could get together with a few people who told him this was a great idea and pass legislation binding the House by summoning a majority through the Whips? How is this an acceptable way of dealing with such important legislation?</P>
      <P>The way in which we make legislation has changed. Either a few civil servants persuade the <Col N="112"/>Minister or the Minister persuades his civil servants that legislation is required and the Minister brings an item to Cabinet. All he needs is for the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to give it the nod; a majority will be mustered in the House to put it through. That is no way to behave in a parliamentary democracy even for a Bill dealing with traffic tickets, but for legislation as important as this it is a scandal of the highest order. Not only the Opposition should be speaking out about this. Government backbenchers would have more to say about this if they were worth their salt.</P>
      <P>It is possible that this is the most secure system in the world, but it could also be a Trojan horse. I do not know. I do know, however, that I am a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, sent here by 115,000 people in the city of Dublin, and I am not happy or reassured about this legislation and nor are the people I represent. &ldquo;Where is the fire?&rdquo; they ask. They want to know what is the hurry with this legislation. If it works, why not do exactly as Deputy Gilmore said and try it in a few more constituencies and let people have their say? Why is there such a rush to bring this in? Who is demanding it? The answer is that nobody is demanding it. It is typical of the way this House is treated. It has become a rubber stamp for the Government.</P>
      <P>Last summer I read a book called <i>The Assassination of Robert Maxwell</i>, written by two distinguished journalists, Martin Dillon and Gordon Thomas, the latter of whom has written extensively and authoritatively on issues concerning Ireland. The central thesis of the book is that Robert Maxwell was assassinated by Mossad. It contends that Mossad stole from the CIA a computer software system called Promis, which put a secret microchip into Chinese computers, enabling it to steal state secrets from China and Canada as well as from many business people. This is not in the slightest bit far-fetched; in fact, it has the ring of truth about it. I do not know much about computers. I do not need to, but I know much about people, this Republic and the values of democracy. I have the right to be convinced by anyone advocating such a dramatic change that there is a case for it. Nobody has convinced me in this instance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned that the legislation was rammed through the committee, but it should never have been sent to the committee in the first place. Such an important Bill should have been dealt with on the floor of the House. This has implications for the way in which we sustain our democracy. It is not a far-fetched idea that somebody could in the future devise a microchip or an infra-red system, which could operate from a distance, to send our computer system into viral decline. All this might be completely wrong; it could be impossible to do any of this. Of the 166 Members of the House, however, only two or three are convinced that this is not possible. The rest, if they were telling the truth, would admit <Col N="113"/>they did not really know but they obtained assurances from the Minister. If the Minister, in turn, was telling the truth he would say he did not really know, but he obtained assurances from a few so-called experts.</P>
      <P>This is vitally important legislation. Bringing in amended legislation to take care of the views of the Opposition is not the way to deal with it. This legislation is so important that if the Government does not listen to the Opposition we should walk out in protest. I have been in this House for 23 years and nobody has ever heard me say this before. This legislation should not proceed until the genuine questions raised by the Opposition are addressed. It should be put on hold until there is real cross-party support and until people's fears and concerns about the implications of such a system for democracy, particularly in light of the absence of a paper trail, are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This evening, for the first time, three Opposition parties have united on a Private Members' motion &mdash; three parties representing more than 40% of the electorate. We are not playing politics with this issue, as has been said by a number of Government Deputies. We have put down a motion to express our serious reservations about the proposed introduction of electronic voting and the approach the Minister has taken on this issue. We have done so because there is a genuine concern that mistakes are being made in the matter of a fundamental democratic procedure &mdash; voting. The right to cast one's vote in secrecy and to expect it to be registered and properly counted is fundamental to any democracy.</P>
      <P>Why did the Government not approach the issue of electronic voting on an all-party basis? Do we have a Government that is so arrogant it thinks it is all-knowing? This is about fundamentally changing the way in which people vote. Should a Government be spending &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money rushing in a new system against the wishes of Opposition spokespersons, who must sit there as they are told the system is foolproof? Are we as Opposition politicians supposed to sit on our hands and refrain from raising valid concerns about the system? Changing a voting system should not be a party political issue, but Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have made it so. It should be decided on by the House collectively. Unfortunately, that has not happened.</P>
      <P>Why has the Government waited until today to decide to establish an independent panel to verify the secrecy and accuracy of arrangements proposed for electronic voting? Surely this panel should have been set up before the money was committed and the system approved, and before a PR consultant was handed the contract for promoting and informing people about the system. The machines and the system have already been launched, but we are only now setting up an independent panel to verify accuracy. If ever there was a case of putting the <Col N="114"/>cart before the horse, this was it. The Government knows this but it is too stubborn and arrogant to admit it and change tack. When is this independent panel supposed to report on the secrecy and accuracy of the system? How can the panel allay concerns about the much talked-about absence of a paper trail, should there be a problem that requires a recount?</P>
      <P>Why have we not insisted on the introduction of a system that has a voter-verified paper audit trail? Why are we being asked to put all our trust in a system that cannot be checked and checked again, if necessary, with a physical paper trail? In various parts of the world there are models that use paper trails so that in the unlikely event &mdash; I accept it is extremely unlikely &mdash; of a problem arising, a proper back-up is available. No system is entirely flawless or entirely predictable. We were told that the electronic voting system in the House was flawless, but it got a virus which necessitated its being turned off for a number of weeks until it was fixed. What is the downside to a paper trail? I do not see one. We have been told by the makers of the machines we are planning to introduce that it is possible to introduce a paper trail alongside the voting system they have outlined. Why is the Government not insisting on that? I am not opposed to the introduction of electronic voting, nor in my view is the majority on this side of the House, although some Members have genuine reservations. However, we are opposed to the Government introducing a system that has been questioned by many and about which we have genuine concerns. If the Government is to bring forward an e-voting system, it should be done properly and the genuine concerns of Members should be allayed.</P>

    <Title>Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of people have contacted me about high-powered spotlights on jeeps, lorries and cars asking about the law in regard to spotlights. I believe many people have been killed on Irish roads as a result of these blinding lights. I travel up and down to my constituency, spending more time on the road than at home. However, every time I see these high-powered lights I become annoyed. I question what the law is in this regard and what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing about it. I have tabled parliamentary questions on spotlights. The lights on new cars also create problems. The cars are built for the flat roads on the Continent and when they hit a bump on Irish roads, high-powered lights flash on which are a hazard for other motorists. I have heard people say that when these high-powered lights hit their eyes late at night, there is a problem. Will the Minister respond in the House or have his <Col N="115"/>officials write to me stating the law and whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is taking the correct approach to the matter?</P>
      <P>Another issue I have raised every year since being elected to this House is road signage. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not dealt with the serious issue of signage. We are supposed to be one of the fastest growing modern economies in the European Union, yet it is impossible for visitors arriving at Dublin Airport to know from the signage how to go north, south east or west. What have the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government and Ireland against road signage? I challenge the Minister or his officials to go out a quarter of a mile from any part of the city and try to find their way using the road signage. There is no proper signage in Dublin or in any city in this country.</P>
      <P>Every year the issue of road signage is the largest cause of complaints to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. Surveys show that people cannot find their way round the country. When people lose their way, they make mistakes which cause accidents. Last week the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, spoke about changing the road signage to express distance in kilometres. Before more taxpayers' money is wasted, he should deal with the issue of road signage. Nobody gets lost in any part of Britain, because there are road signs everywhere. There is no proper signage directing one in or out of any city in Ireland. I acknowledge that extra funding has been allocated to signage, but I see no improvement. That is wrong. They erected a second set of signs in Dublin, having wasted money on the first set, but the job was not finished.</P>
      <P>The motorist is fleeced from the day he or she buys a car, with the cost of tax, repairs and petrol. It is time that motorists organised and demanded better roads. The N5 from Longford to Westport is outrageous. Industrialists from County Mayo &mdash; from Allergon in Westport, which employs more than 1,000 people, and the health care sector in Castlebar and Ballina which export to China, Amsterdam and London &mdash; have lobbied the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the bad roads which damage products giving rise to a high level of complaints. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The BMW region is not getting the necessary level of finance from the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or European funding. It is accepted in Europe that the BMW region has fallen behind in terms of infrastructure, but the region is not getting the drawdown from the Government. The investment seems to be made on the east coast. We deserve <Col N="116"/>a national primary road from Westport to Dublin and it is wrong that it is not in place.</P>
      <P>Inflation is running at 1.8%, yet the Government scalds the taxpayer with indirect taxes and is levying an additional 5% by way of motor taxation. The local authorities are out of control. I am calling on the Minister to introduce the necessary legislation to make local authorities accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General, thus coming before the Committee of Public Accounts. Local authorities engage auditors but since I became a councillor in 1979, I have never seen a report on the way the auditor audited the local authority. At least the Comptroller and Auditor General presents his report to the Committee of Public Accounts which can examine the people involved. The witnesses also know they will be examined again the following year. That does not happen in local authorities. The Minister has lost control because his focus is on electronic voting and stopping people voting for whom they want. He is more concerned about running a dictatorship than a democracy. It should be pointed out to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that we live in a democracy.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to be negative on the question of the funding provided for national secondary roads, the only scheme I have seen working well in rural areas is the CL&Aacute;R programme. Although I have my disagreements with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, at least he understands how rural Ireland works and the needs of rural areas. He has provided funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme and it is one of the better programmes for rural areas. These areas have not seen or received the resources they deserve for secondary roads.</P>
      <P>We want equality. There is an imbalance in this country. Rural areas are not getting the infrastructure or funding they require. This country is drawing down EU funding on the back of rural Ireland and the BMW area but in all Departments that funding has been directed into the east coast. I have nothing against that area; it is important that it receives funding too. However, it must be a fair share. The east coast area has drawn down three and four rounds of EU funding while some parts of the west have not even received the first round. I hope when the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, is elected to the European Parliament he will fight on behalf of rural areas and tell the Europeans about the imbalance and how the Government conned the EU by drawing down funding on the back of the BMW region but diverted that funding to the east coast. We have seen some improvements but not enough.</P>
      <P>Road signage and safety on the roads are important. It is also important to have good roads. People are paying enough motor taxes to have good roads. It is time the Government took <Col N="117"/>another look at the rail service. It should stop big lorries carrying heavy loads of goods into rural areas and get them to use the train service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I wish to put on record my views on motor tax, the role of motors in Irish society, the road safety issue, the Dublin Port tunnel and other important matters relating to motorists and taxation. Over the years motorists have received a bad press and I do not agree with the current, politically correct aim of driving motorists off the roads.</P>
      <P>I am a regular motorist and have driven around many parts of this country and through many countries in Europe. I have seen some examples of good practice in motoring as well as disgraceful and bad practices. Motorists have no problem paying their taxes and the figures show their massive contribution in tax to the Exchequer. However, do we get value for money? We need more good quality roads and a first class, efficient policing service.</P>
      <P>I welcome recent progress in the construction of top quality roads. This has led to major improvements in the economic development of the country. It has also led to improved road safety. Most recent accidents have occurred on minor roads. We must confront this reality and improve these smaller roads. More investment is required to improve the quality of life for motorists, particularly those using minor roads.</P>
      <P>While discussing this Bill on motor tax and the motoring sector in general, it is relevant to raise the issue of the Dublin Port tunnel. Most people have heard about the positive side of this project but there is another side. There are now 117 homes in my constituency whose walls, floors and doors have been damaged in recent weeks. The residents of Marino, Fairview and Santry have had to endure major disruption and, in recent days, major explosions took place under homes in Marino and Fairview. This has led to suffering and trauma. I am anxious to represent their views in this debate.</P>
      <P>The way they are being treated is a disgrace and I urge Dublin City Council and the Minister for Transport to listen to their grievances and do something practical for them. There is no point winning awards for engineering projects when homes are being damaged by the use of explosives and huge tunnel boring machines. Today I received the up to date figures on this problem. The number of complaints registered in my constituency to date is 117. There are 72 complaints from within the 30 metre zone of the tunnel and 45 complaints from outside the 30 metre zone. There have been 72 building precondition surveys, the number of loss adjuster's initial reports was 77, the number of loss adjuster's investigations ongoing was 39 and the number of repairs of cracks undertaken to date is one. One house has been repaired. It is important that the Minister is aware of what is happening. There are 83 cracks in houses, 14 <Col N="118"/>hairline cracks, 12 instances of jammed doors, windows and glazing, two damaged roofs, five homes with plumbing problems and one other serious complaint. The total is 117.</P>
      <P>I raise these issues in this debate because the tunnel is part of the strategy for transport. Following inspection of alleged damage, it has been agreed with the remaining householders to postpone repair work until the return journey has been undertaken by the tunnel boring machine. Approximately 585 people in these 117 homes are directly affected by this project.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative form to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences contained in the financial resolution passed by the D&aacute;il on 25 November 2003. A standard across the board increase of 5% is provided for. The increased revenue that will arise will be paid into the local government fund. That is a progressive development. Since the establishment of the local government fund in January 1999, all motor tax receipts, including payments for driving licences and so forth, are paid into it. In addition, the fund is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution. The fund is ring-fenced for local authority purposes and is distributed to local authorities as discretionary grants in respect of daily spending requirements and expenditure on non-national roads. These are sensible objectives. I strongly support the concept of ring fencing funding for projects. That is what the consumer and motorist wants.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is the interpretation section containing definitions used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides that the new rates of motor tax and fees for trade plates apply to licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004. Yesterday saw another development in the continuing debate on transport when there was a huge stoppage in bus and rail transport in Dublin and throughout the State. A total of 9,000 transport workers are concerned about their jobs. These are decent, hard working people. They are PAYE taxpayers and many of them are motorists who pay their motor taxes. They have a right to be heard. I disagree with the political parties, particularly the Government parties and some of the Opposition parties, who attacked the NRBU. These workers deserve our support.</P>
      <P>They are concerned about privatisation, which is an important issue for them. I appeal to the Minister not to wreck our public transport services. I accept that the stoppage was grounded on fear but some commentators have also said it was grounded on emotion, which I do not accept. I urge the Minister and the Government to talk and listen to the unions about these important issues. They are also relevant to the debate on motor tax. These 9,000 workers, in addition to working in the public transport services, have family cars and pay their motor taxes. They have a right to be heard because they are stakeholders in the service.</P><Col N="119"/>
      <P>Earlier some Deputies said that the problem of potholes has gone from the agenda. I do not accept that. One road in my constituency, Philipsburg Avenue in Dublin 3, is full of potholes and I have been discussing this in the last few days with residents on the road. They are demanding action. Many of them are motorists who pay their motor taxes. They are demanding that these roads and potholes be fully serviced and surfaced. They are a health and public safety hazard and I urge the Minister, the Department and Dublin City Council to get their acts together and repair Philipsburg Avenue.</P>
      <P>There is much misinformation on the matter of penalty points. Many of the people caught under the existing legislation are caught at seven or eight miles above the limit in 30 mph or 40 mph zones. However, most accidents happen where speeds of 80 mph, 90 mph or sometimes even 100 mph are the issue. Let us be honest with the people on this matter. The sad reality is that the death toll to date this year is 47, up ten on this time last year. We have a major problem with regard to road and public safety and we must deal with it.</P>
      <P>Cyclists on our roads are another issue. I urge them to be careful and cautious. I support them in their campaign for cycle lanes. However, there are many irresponsible cyclists, particularly in Dublin. who jump red lights, weave in and out of traffic and clip off cars etc. I urge them to be careful so that we do not end up with cyclists being killed. They should have respect for themselves, motorists and the public.</P>
      <P>We have a major crisis on roads like Collins Avenue and Griffith Avenue where heavy goods vehicles blatantly disobey the law of the land. I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this. Heavy goods vehicles are using these roads although they are not permitted to enter these areas. The law must be implemented properly.</P>
      <P>I commend the motorists of this country who contribute &euro;4 billion to the Exchequer in taxation. They have a right to proper services and roads. They also have a right to an input into the development of services as do the 9,000 workers, many of whom are motorists, who took part in yesterday's public transport demonstration. The way to solve the problem is through a combination of private motoring and quality public transport. It is not one or the other.</P>
      <P>I disagree with some of my colleagues in other parties who appear to be obsessed with hammering motorists. Yes, we must have a quality public transport system but we must also respect the rights of private motorists. The reality is that people need a car to bring their children to schools and football matches etc. These are matters for our debate on motor taxation. Some &euro;4 billion has been given to the Exchequer by motorists who have no problem with paying their taxes. These normal decent people who pay their <Col N="120"/>taxes deserve services. We have no problem with paying our taxes but we are putting down a marker in this debate with respect to this legislation. We will pay our taxes but we demand a say in the provision and running of the services. The Government should not dismiss lightly the views of motorists and taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to address this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Tom Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The continuing increases in motor tax have a detrimental effect on the quality of life, particularly of rural dwellers. The tax must be paid irrespective of people's ability to pay. People in rural Ireland have no choice as without public transport a car is essential. Two cars are essential for most households where one partner must drive to work and the other must take children to and from school and other social events. Most of these families live on the minimum wage and household budgets are tight. In order to survive, these families must have discretion on how they spend their money. However, like many other tax charges such as water charges, refuse charges, development charges, car tax is a standing charge which must be paid irrespective of the family's income or ability to pay.</P>
      <P>This situation is made worse by this Government's policies. Despite the lip-service paid to rural communities, the Government continues to deplete rural towns and villages of essential services through policy after policy. Post offices are closing down at an abnormal rate as a result of a successful collaboration between the Government and An Post. The Government is the only shareholder in An Post and therefore, one must assume An Post is carrying out the will of its shareholder. If not, the Government has the power to deal with the situation to ensure An Post carries out its policy. The current policy and collaboration appears a clever tactic to close post offices in our towns and villages.</P>
      <P>Pensioners in rural areas have no choice but to have a car. The nearest post office could be 15 or 20 miles from them. The nearest cash machine and many other services are inaccessible without a car. Pensioners on &euro;164 per week need transport. They must have a car or take a taxi and to get to even the most basic service can cost them up to half of their pension. The free travel scheme introduced for pensioners is an excellent scheme and works well for those living in cities. However, its effectiveness is limited in rural areas because no public transport is available. Pensioners are still expected to pay an ever increasing tax on their cars. Those in rural areas who value their independence have no choice in the matter and will sacrifice many ordinary <Col N="121"/>everyday necessities to maintain their independence.</P>
      <P>This Government continues to tell us it is a low tax Government. Nobody argues that it is a low income tax Government for the wealthy. These people have no problem paying stealth taxes such as motor tax or service charges. The story is different for people on middle incomes, those in the minimum wage group or people on social welfare. Even with the increased stealth charges the Government is imposing on local authorities, these authorities are still grossly under-funded.</P>
      <P>Apart from roads, basic services such as the disabled person's grant have been suspended for almost a year. Nobody can justify the fact that elderly people are living in damp cold conditions without a shower or a bathroom. This is what the policies of this Government impose on our elderly and disadvantaged. The net result of these taxes, imposed under the pretext of local authority funding, is that the poorest and weakest in our society must pay taxes such as car tax, irrespective of their ability to pay. On the other hand, they cannot depend on county councils to provide a disabled person's grant, an essential repairs grant or a half decent road to their houses.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, motor tax is for the restoration, upgrading and repair of county and regional roads. However, the Department makes such a complicated affair of funding local government that nobody is ever sure what funds are being increased and which are being decreased. The refusal of the Government to fund benchmarking for local authorities has hampered them from increasing road funds from their own resources. On 27 January this year the Minister, Deputy Cullen, had the cheek to threaten local authorities that if they did not continue to put money into local roads, he would punish them by cutting back their funding. He expects local authorities to put &euro;150 million into local road networks this year while at the same time depriving them of &euro;160 million by not paying benchmarking.</P>
      <P>Considering this, one wonders whether the Minister is living in the real world. Local authorities are at their wits' end trying to keep basic services going, let alone provide extra funding for county roads. In Cork basic hedge cutting, done by the council for years, was suspended last year and will be suspended for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o'clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, made an announcement about his new CL&Aacute;R initiative. He referred to the money he was allocating to CL&Aacute;R. It is true that funding was allocated to minor roads in the CL&Aacute;R region, but what nobody realised until a few months later was that the same amount of money was withdrawn through the abolition of the tertiary roads grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="122"/>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a big announcement by a Minister about the transfer of puny resources from one fund to another.</P>
      <P>The greatest scandal of all for the people of Cork is that despite the fact that they pay car tax at the same rate as everybody else, for the past seven years under the Government, Cork has been consistently last or second last of any county in terms of euro per kilometre spent. With two Ministers, one Minister of State and nine backbenchers, County Cork continues to fare the worst in the country.</P>
      <P>Even from a roads point of view it is hard to see where all the car tax money is going, in addition to all the other taxes collected. It is impossible to justify the black hole into which these taxes are disappearing. It is painfully obvious that rural areas suffer the most and get the least value for taxes paid. The underlying injustice of this tax and many other stealth taxes introduced by the Government is that they must be paid irrespective of ability to pay. If the Government persists with this tax policy, it should look at ways of reducing the burden on pensioners by introducing a waiver scheme for rural dwellers living on social welfare. The Government will not change its colours, it is a Government for the rich and privileged and, as long as taxes are indirect and do not unduly affect its friends, it will continue to ignore the plight of those not in a position to pay these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this important subject. The huge increase in the number of cars in the past ten or twelve years is a sign of our reliance on the car. Not so many years ago people spoke of a house as being essential to their needs. In recent years the car has also become an essential part of our lives. A few years ago there was one car to every house, but now there are up to four. We see this stark reality as we travel around the country. There are now more people working in each household, which is for the good of families, the community and society in general. Nowadays both partners often work. The number of people commuting long distances to work has also increased, leading to an increase in the number of cars on our roads.</P>
      <P>The most startling figure that was revealed of late is that &euro;4 billion is spent annually by motorists on taxation. Any increase is hard to take but the recent increase in tax is more difficult again. Road users are getting worse value for money than ever before.</P>
      <P>I accept that roads have improved in some areas. However, with the amount of tax paid, are people getting value for this extra money? Are local authorities giving value for money and accounting for the money they spend? Many roads need upgrading, especially tertiary roads. Only a fraction of the money needed is available to community and local improvement schemes. We need to get better value for money from local authorities. If this was sought, local improvement <Col N="123"/>schemes, which have upgraded roads in certain areas, could go further.</P>
      <P>Many simple measures, such as hedge cutting, could to be implemented which would make driving a great deal safer. Four or five years ago most country roads were cut late in September or October on an annual basis. It made the countryside look a lot better but the practice has ceased in most local authority areas. Deputy Murphy referred to it ceasing in Cork last year. In my own county it ceased three years ago. The same is true of hedge cutting in county council areas right across the country. This is a simple way of making our roads safer. With all this money going into local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should insist that hedges be cut. More co-operation is required with landowners. It is not simply a case of landowners tidying their hedges.</P>
      <P>With the amount of money available it is possible to make rural roads, in particular, a great deal safer. Signage is deplorable in certain rural areas. Feeble efforts are made by some local authorities to paint and redecorate their signage. From travelling to Europe we have enough experience of how signage is dealt with in other European countries. There is no excuse for us not improving our signage.</P>
      <P>Road accidents were referred to earlier in the debate. It is true that roads appear to have become more dangerous. The introduction of penalty points brought about a decrease in road accidents but over the weekend we saw that the figures are slowly creeping up again. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to have a more hands-on approach to ensure that our roads are safer.</P>
      <P>Other simple measures can be taken in regard to lorries. Like many other people in Leinster House, I travel to and from my constituency. Many trucks travel the same roads. In wet conditions trucks spray water from their sides because they do not have any flaps. Legislation should be introduced to ensure that all trucks are covered on their sides with rubber, particularly over the wheels, as they are in other countries. This is a simple measure which would make driving a lot safer for the motorist.</P>
      <P>By neglecting rail, we have lost out on an opportunity in regard to transport. We are over-reliant on road transport as a means of transporting goods to ports and other destinations. We should concentrate more on our rail network to improve the safety of the motorist. In the long term this would make driving a great deal easier. We need to examine the impact of heavy goods vehicles on our road.We need to look at this as it is having a devastating impact on the structure of roads.</P>
      <P>For far too long we have been much too slow about improving traffic calming measures in villages throughout the country. I was in a school <Col N="124"/>in the village of Rosegreen last week. The headmaster pointed out trucks travelling past the school at 30 mph and 35 mph. With a little skid, those trucks could land in the grounds of the school or even the classroom. We are told that the local authority does not have money available for traffic calming measures there.</P>
      <P>We are constantly increasing taxes in the State and that is the purpose of this Bill. If we are doing so, we should be providing more in return. This is why the public is against the increases in taxation. If the public could see improvements in hedge cutting, road signage and traffic calming measures, they could more readily accept it.</P>
      <P>I know the House will pass the Bill. It will mean that more finance is made available and I hope that it is seen to give value. Motorists are fed up paying more money and not getting value for it. The public wants value and richly deserve a better return on their taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is in the House to hear our contributions. I hope he notes them and brings the message back to his senior Minister. This is the place that counts &mdash; or should count if we live in a democracy. Opinions are expressed here and Ministers are responsible to the House. The Minister is not responsible to the pressure groups that he loves to meet. He loves to have the cameras and the pretty girls in attendance; he uses them at every launch. While I am disappointed that the Minister is not in the House, I know that the Minister of State will report back to him.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to bring in more tax. With its 5% increase across the board, it imposes more tax on the poor motorist. The Government says it is doing so much for ordinary people and made a song and dance about what it spends on social welfare. They did not tell the people that they were going to increase car tax. This is on top of other taxes imposed on motorists. VRT is extremely high in this State. While people talk about being in the EU, it has no effect when it comes to vehicles. Ireland has one of the highest charges for vehicles in the EU. What about buying goods in another EU country? One can buy what one likes, but Ireland will crease one with VRT when one returns here with a car purchased in another EU state.</P>
      <P>Why can we not have the famous level playing pitch that people keep talking about? We cannot because the Government wants more tax and to cripple the motorist. One need only consider the taxes applied to diesel and petrol &mdash; increases were applied to these in the last budget. Time after time, the poor motorist is being hit. The NCT seems to be a money-raising venture. One will hear of the minute reasons for which cars have been failed. Owners must go back, pay the fee &mdash; that is the important thing &mdash; and the car will be passed immediately. It is another tax on motorists.</P><Col N="125"/>
      <P>The Minister of State lives in a city and has buses running past his doorstep that will carry him where he needs to go. If he needs to use the post office, there will be one within a bus ride, if not within walking distance. Similarly, Garda stations and Government services are within easy reach by foot or bus. This is not the case in rural areas. Many pensioners have to travel eight or ten miles to collect their pension at the local post office. While the Minister of State might say that they should have it paid by standing order into their bank accounts, pensioners will still have to travel to the local town to use an ATM. Public transport is inadequate in many places and they need to have their own vehicles. Many people cannot access services locally because the Government is closing post offices and Garda stations, etc. It is not fair that this additional tax should be imposed on them.</P>
      <P>When one consider the taxes imposed on vehicles, the cost of the NCT and thinks of the income some elderly people are living on, one will think it is too high considering the few miles they travel each week. They use the vehicle to travel to the nearby town to collect the pension, shop for groceries and attend Mass. It is not fair to increase motor tax by 5% in a country where having one's own transport has become so important.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that since the start of the local government fund in January 1999, all motor tax receipts, including driver licence fees, are paid into the fund. Furthermore, the memorandum states that the fund is ring-fenced exclusively for local authority purposes and is distributed to local authorities in respect of discretionary grants in respect of day to day spending requirements and for expenditure on non-national roads. While many people think this money is used solely on roads, it is not the case; it is used for a variety of services across the local authority sector. One will hear people justifying the rise by saying extra money will be made available for roads. This money should be ring-fenced for roads and ensure they are brought up to standard. Many of our roads are in poor condition and special measures must be taken to bring them up to standard.</P>
      <P>I have a bee in my bonnet regarding speed limits at schools. I am sure the Minister of State has been to the United States. If he has, he may have seen the special speed areas outside schools. At school opening and closing times a speed limit of 15 mph is put in place, signalled by flashing lights. Anyone who breaks this is treated quite severely. We need to something like this here. Coralstown national school is adjacent to the N4 near Mullingar. Parents transporting their children to and from school must park on the side of this national primary route where the speed limit is 60 mph. While flashing lights are in place there, they do not seem to have any effect. We are lucky in that we have not yet had a major problem there. This is the type of area where a <Col N="126"/>pilot scheme with special provisions could be put in place. I am looking for this at school opening and closing times, and I hope the Minister will take note of my request. Coralstown is the famous school that hit the airwaves. One of my colleagues delivered around this time last year a letter and a photograph with the Minister to the school. He was going to deliver money for the school, which was to be built and opened. The money had been &ldquo;ring-fenced&rdquo; &mdash; that famous word which I see here in the explanatory memorandum.</P>

Perhaps the Minister might also examine, when he returns to his Department and talks to his senior Minister, the matter of driver testing. It is a laugh to think that we have almost 1 million people driving on provisional licences in this country. Will the Minister get his finger out and do something about this? He should try to get it moved forward and get the tests sorted out as quickly as he can. This really needs to happen as matters are in a bad way.</P>

	<P>I was merely giving the Deputy factual information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, who is always very good at that. I also wish to raise something that no one else has mentioned but which relates to vehicles, car tax and so on, namely an EU directive on end-of-life vehicles. It stated that, when vehicles reach the end of their lives, they be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. One would get rid of the oil and the exhaust, which would not simply be piled in a heap, and all that costs money. The players involved in this such as the motoring organisations, the Minister and the car dismantlers all came together before the last election with another Minister &mdash; Deputy Noel Dempsey at that time. An agreement was reached regarding what would happen about the end-of-<Col N="127"/>life vehicles directive and how it would be implemented in Ireland. Everything was sorted out, signed and sealed or so we thought.</P>
      <P>However, after the election a new Minister was appointed. That new Minister, for some reason or another, decided that he would reopen the whole business. Strangely, when he did so, he went to talk to only one of the partner organisations in the outfit, namely, the SIMI. He did not bother talking to the other people, the dismantlers, at all. They were quite happy with the arrangement, but suddenly the SIMI got cold feet on it, and it seemed to enjoy power and influence, having the ear of the Minister to get the previous agreement dismantled.</P>
      <P>Nothing has happened. It is all up in the sky, and the directive, which should have been implemented in this country two years ago, has still not been implemented. The EU is now taking us to court over it because the Minister decided to unravel what appeared to be a perfectly good agreement. The partners who had signed up to it were happy with it, but the Minister decided to revisit it. Why did he do that? Who brought the influence to bear on him? Why did he unravel that agreement, and will he come into this House and explain to us what exactly happened, who he met, what discussions he had and by what right he failed to implement the directive when it seemed a good thing to do?</P>
      <P>Given the difficulties faced by motorists in this city, I sometimes marvel that people around Dublin have cars at all. To drive in and out of this city with traffic at its current levels is absolutely awful. The other morning I was coming to Leinster House, and it took me 40 minutes to come from the Liberties to here. The traffic was appallingly bad as it is regularly. Then, if one manages to negotiate the new Luas lines, the potholes and the digging of the roads, to avoid the clampers, who represent another tax on the motorist in Dublin, and get to one's destination, the sad thing is that one must face the journey out again later. The congestion is terrible, and we are failing to do anything about it, not managing traffic properly in this city and, unfortunately, in many provincial towns. I can mention my own town of Mullingar, where the congestion is becoming quite unacceptable. We are failing to keep pace with the need for additional parking spaces and to provide access to and exit from towns in a free-flowing fashion, enabling motorists to do their business and move on. We are wasting time and energy and polluting the atmosphere by having long tailbacks for drivers and car owners while they attempt to gain access to the various towns and services they require.</P>
      <P>I also neglected to mention rural people and the need for vehicles. All those over 66 years are entitled to a free travel pass. In many rural areas, that is absolutely useless. I know that it is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department, but <Col N="128"/>it relates to the transport sector and he could perhaps use his influence with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. It might be logical to allow rural people to convert their free travel pass to vouchers that they could use in taxis. If one is living in the back of beyond and there is no bus service in the area, what good is a free travel pass? However, if one had a voucher system worth perhaps &euro;100 per annum, one could use it with one's local taxi service to gain access to the town for one's pension or provisions or for whatever purpose. This would be fair recompense to those people who live in rural areas and do not have the opportunity to use their free travel passes.</P>
      <P>If one is in the city, one has great access to public transport and can use that free travel pass regularly and get fantastic value from it. One can get many miles under one's belt by using it. Unfortunately, one's rural cousins do not have the same bonus. It is an idea that the Minister might want to bear in mind. A few years ago, we made provision for people living on islands to use the free travel pass to fly in and out as a concession. There was some help towards those journeys. Why not now extend this in order that the free travel passes can be used by those living in rural areas? It is quite a simple system. People would get vouchers cashable through the Department in the same way as the butter voucher system some years ago. People would get vouchers and could use them with taxi services. That would help defray the cost they incur regularly by paying their way to various places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured to say a few words on this Bill. I have felt for some years that the poor unfortunate motorist is beset by problems such as bad roads, Government, and every single obstacle that one could imagine. This is a far cry from 1977, when the incoming Fianna F&aacute;il Party Government was elected with the largest majority in the history of the State on the basis that it would abolish car tax. We were to have free roads with no car tax and would live as if tomorrow would never come. After a year or two, however, the country went broke and was sunk in debt to the extent that it has taken almost the entire intervening period to extricate ourselves from it.</P>
      <P>That was a different era when what was important was getting the election in the bag. The electorate was bought by dangling promises, but once it was in, the door was slammed shut. Times have changed and more mature visions have taken over the Government. The motorist is now seen as somebody who can be regularly squeezed for more revenue to enable the Government to fulfil its promises at the next election, having failed to fulfil its promises at the previous election. The theory is that if it hammers the motorist hard enough, it will have enough money to buy the next election. As for the election after that, the Government hopes that with the grace of God and a few other interventions, people may <Col N="129"/>not take much notice and will allow it to slip back into power again.</P>
      <Miles par="113" com="cl"/><P>Total revenue from motorists currently stands at &euro;4 billion per annum. For all the recognition motorists receive, they now appear to be the equivalent of public enemy No. 1. While I appreciate the need for road safety and compliance with regulations, regardless of where motorists drive, somebody is watching, checking, examining and challenging them.</P>
      <P>In the past two budgets, the Minister for Finance decided to take a closer look at motorists. His policy appears to have been to ask who they think they are driving around the countryside in their cars and how he can take more from them. This would not be so bad if we had roads of a similar quality to those in other European countries, including some of the former communist countries, or if one could drive on our roads without fear of losing half one's car in a pothole. We have, however, some of the worst roads in the world and there is no point in the Government priding itself in the work it has done in recent years.</P>
      <P>We also have the smallest number of motorways in Europe. Some people may argue that this is beneficial, but if we want to progress and move with the times, we need to examine modes of transport. In the absence of an alternative to the car, we must assume motor vehicles are likely to be a mode of transport for a considerable period and the motorist is here to stay.</P>
      <P>It is odd that in most other countries efforts are made to ensure motorists can travel from A to B as quickly as possible, roads are smooth and safe and vehicles are safe, whereas motorists here face an obstacle course. The first hurdle is the driving test. Motorists are lucky to receive an appointment for a driving test within a year or 18 months of joining the waiting list. In some areas, including my local area, failure rates are 50%, which means the unfortunate motorist who fails must wait another year or 18 months before going through the same procedure, again on the basis of a 50-50 chance of being successful. The system is something of a lottery and the unreasonable 50% failure rate raises only two possibilities, either the instruction or the test is flawed.</P>
      <P>If the poor, unfortunate motorist passes the test and survives the potholes and the Minister's annual motor tax and VAT increases, he or she has the pleasure of being involved in traffic jams. Every local parish pump village can boast of its own traffic jam as a result of lack of vision and forethought in designing our roads, which one would have expected to be a priority. Towns and villages with populations of 200 or 300 have traffic jams four times a day, during the morning and evening rush hours and as children are brought to and from school. Motorists in ordinary country villages have all the benefits of motoring, including traffic jams on their doorstep, for which <Col N="130"/>they contribute to the sum of &euro;4 billion to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Motorists are blamed for pollution, travelling on the roads and being alive, while the &euro;4 billion they contribute to the Exchequer each year appears to go unnoticed. This revenue appears to be taken for granted, as if it was a State's right to insist that people hand over such a sum a money on an annual basis in order that it can do with it as it likes. No recognition is given to the fact that the unfortunate, hard-pressed motorist must meet this bill every year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made considerable capital out of the non-national roads allocation for this year. This may be wonderful, but it is not a minute before time. Even if the amount were doubled, it would not be noticed. In view of the necessity to have roads in good condition around election time in June, the Government decided to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Recently, I punctured two tyres in two potholes. This was the first time this happened since I started driving in about 1962 &mdash; perhaps I can no longer drive as well as I could. The Minister of State may have picked up the wrong folder but he need not worry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Its relevance is the degree to which the Government, of which you are a strong supporter, has taken gullible motorists to one side, extracted money from their pockets and given them nothing in return. You should be ashamed of the condition of our roads. A Cheann Comhairle, you are looking at me as if I did not have much time left.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister of State upset me again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not allow himself to be upset. If he addressed his remarks through the Chair, he might not invite interruption and would not be upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was afraid the Ceann Comhairle would take my remark personally. At this juncture, it is worthwhile to remind the Government of what it has done to the poor, unfortunate motorist. It has created traffic jams <Col N="131"/>everywhere and charged motorists large sums of money to inhale the exhaust fumes from their cars as they sit in traffic. What else does it have in mind for motorists?</P>
      <P>The motorist and the rail passenger are about to meet. It has been said that never the twain shall meet but they are about to do so in this country in a fashion that was never intended, at a roundabout called the Red Cow. Is it fair that this motorist who is carrying on his back this burden of &euro;4 billion which he subscribes every year to the Government, should have to face into a train crossing the road at the Red Cow roundabout? That is how it will be. There is nowhere else for the train or the motorist to go. I suggest that some considerable soul-searching needs to take place to find out who will have the right of way at that time and who should now pay the price of the burden being placed on the poor, unfortunate motorist.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is a medical man and knows the dangers of being too long in a tunnel, inhaling exhaust fumes. We were recently informed about another Government enterprise in store for the motorist, namely, the Dublin Port tunnel. This tunnel has been a long time in preparation and I am informed that all modern technology was used in the preparation of the plans. Not only did it appear to be too shallow and too narrow but now it appears that it does not have sufficient air&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should stick to the Naas Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and again the motorist who is carrying the &euro;4 billion burden of his annual subscription to this Government, will sit in the tunnel in the gas without a gas mask. That is appalling. The Ceann Comhairle is a medical man and will recognise the dangers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. I am not going into detail; I am just making a passing reference to the dangers of motoring and the burden of the tax bill on the motorist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Your passing reference is fine, Deputy, but going into detail would not be appropriate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The safety of the motorist is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that you as a medical man have kept that in mind as well. The people on the <Col N="132"/>other side of the House have forgotten about it entirely. They do not give two pins for the poor unfortunate motorist; all they want is the &euro;4 billion that he has to give them and they have various ways of getting hold of it. They take it by way of VAT, including on tyres, excise duty, motor tax and fuel tax. I wonder why the Government Members are not ashamed and why they do not come into the House one day and say to the motorist, &ldquo;We are very sorry, we have been taking from you for years and have given you nothing in return.&rdquo; Is it that the poor, unfortunate motorist is public enemy No. 1 and is there for the taking at all times?</P>
      <P>I wish to make two other passing references. If the unfortunate motorist manages to pay all the taxation laid upon his head by the Government, and manages to avoid potholes, traffic jams, the Red Cow roundabout, the tunnel and eventually finds a parking place, the chances are he will be clamped. This is a very relevant reference to this Bill which is the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2004. After some considerable difficulty and having put down a series of parliamentary questions to find out exactly how much more money was burdened on the motorist's back other than the tyres, fuel and so forth, I finally received a truncated reply. Most replies from Government nowadays are in truncated form and we have to measure them up ourselves and try to merge them in such a way that they make some kind of sense. Otherwise we do not get the answer. No matter what I did, I could not get an answer about the tolls.</P>
      <P>One day I was at the toll bridge and I counted the number of vehicles going through. It was not a very busy day but for some unknown reason, it showed up a far higher revenue than is readily and regularly available to the general public as accruing from this area. I have now come to the conclusion that the poor, unfortunate motorist, having again travelled the roads, hit the potholes, paid for the tyres, the petrol, the roads, and ignored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not think from listening to the debate that this Bill is to give permanent legal standing to the increases in motor tax which were introduced by financial resolution in the D&aacute;il last November. These increases were introduced with the sole purpose of funding the national roads programme to ensure that local authorities can continue the great progress made in rehabilitating the national roads network.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the safety of motorists. The motorist certainly has been given safe roads. The statistics are very impressive. I was amazed at the figures which showed that the number of deaths on Irish roads last year and the year before are half the number killed on the roads in the early 1970s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are not the statistics of the last few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There will always be ups and downs, sadly. The number of vehicles on the roads is approximately four times the number in the early 1970s. However, the number of deaths has been halved from a peak in the early or mid-1970s of over 600 a year to approximately 330 last year, even though the number of cars has increased by about four times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are parked in traffic jams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of factors such as safer cars have contributed but it is also due to better and safer roads. In conclusion, I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate which was wide-ranging and covered a number of issues and may have wandered off the point at times.</P>
      <P>This Government attaches great importance to local government. It is important that issues relating to the system and funding of local government are well debated. We may not always agree on the solutions but it is good that local government is deemed not only relevant but also important. It is considered by all sides of the House to be one of the cornerstones of our democratic system. Many of us have come from the local authority system and many Members are experts on the system. I hope that will pertain in the future when there will not be as many Members with a background in local government.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Government would not consider increasing any tax if it did not consider it as the correct thing to do. The increase in motor tax by 5%, no matter how unpopular that decision, was the right decision at the time. I do not wish to be flippant but we all know that money has to be earned, it does not come into the Exchequer easily. If we wish to improve our non-national roads network and support local <Col N="134"/>government, then it is necessary to put in the resources.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear Members speak of the need for funding of local government yet they object to this increase which was designed to give extra funding to local government. It is entirely appropriate that funding for non-national roads would be sourced from motor tax as opposed to general taxation. I hope the House will agree that it is a better system than that which pertained in previous times when motor tax was simply absorbed into the Central Fund for use by the Exchequer and was not allocated to local government or roads.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill, the Minister of State said that motor tax receipts, together with an Exchequer contribution, are paid into the local government fund. The introduction of this arrangement led to a huge improvement in the level of resources available to local authorities, particularly for non-national roads. Any objective analysis of the funding system now in place for local government will find that it has been working very well in recent years.</P>
      <P>Despite increased pressure on the public finances, this year's level of funding for the non-national road network is the highest in the history of the State. The Government is investing an average of &euro;4,600 per kilometre on non-national roads in every county. This enormous level of investment is more than double what was spent in 1997. It represents an increase of some 10% on last year's allocation. Given that inflation is running at 1.8%, it is extraordinary that we can provide for an annual increase of 10%. I am pleased that the Government can provide an historic amount of money this year to continue its record of providing record levels of funding for the non-national road network. This achievement, which is considerable in the present economic and budgetary situation, has been helped by the fact that a financial resolution was passed last November.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced a new signage programme, which was demanded by Deputies Ring, Hayes and others during this debate. Some &euro;5 million has been allocated to this programme for the current year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore advocated that an annual report on the local government fund should be presented to the D&aacute;il. I agree with him that there should be full disclosure and accountability in respect of the disbursement of all public funds, including the local government fund. The Deputy will be happy to learn that the presentation to both Houses of the annual accounts of the fund is required under section 3(5) of the Local Government Act 1998.</P>
      <P>Certain Deputies spoke about variations in the level of roads grants. They claimed that some local authorities are receiving bigger increases on last year than others. The variations in grant allocations can be explained by reference to a <Col N="135"/>number of factors. Although the total sum available for allocation is 10% greater than last year's allocation of &euro;434 million, as I said earlier, the effects of certain grant streams, particularly those relating to the regional roads signposting programme and strategic non-national roads categories, mean that some local authorities will receive grant increases or decreases that are significantly different from the average. The grant category of &ldquo;strategic non-national roads&rdquo;, which relates to support for housing and other developments, is available to a limited number of local authorities. This category may be responsible for skewing allocations and percentages for these local authorities, depending on the stage of approved schemes. It is in the nature of such schemes that allocations to local authorities tend to fluctuate from year to year, depending on the size and scale of individual projects. The fluctuations tend to be ironed out over a period of time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore also spoke about the way in which non-national roads grants are allocated. I can inform him that block grants, including special block grants to urban authorities for footpath and carriageway restoration, are allocated on the basis of population. Special block grants have been paid to urban authorities, in addition to their ordinary block grants, for the last five years in recognition of the special needs of urban authorities. The special block grants must be used for restoration works on carriageways and footpaths and should ensure good driving and walking conditions in urban areas. The special grant supplements the block grant received by city, borough and town councils.</P>
      <P>Deputies Hayes, Twomey, Ring and others questioned how local authorities spend their funding and their level of accountability. Local authorities are as accountable as all other public bodies. Given that local authorities are democratically elected, they can be said to be more accountable than many other public bodies. Those of us who have been involved in local authorities and have colleagues who are still members of local authorities know well &mdash; thank God for it &mdash; that officials are put under close scrutiny by councillors on these bodies. Local authorities publish annual accounts and are subject to audit by the independent local government audit service. They must publish a large number of performance indicators so that the public can assess their performances. It is worth noting that local authorities have introduced modern financial management systems, based on accrual accounting principles. As a result, local authorities are ahead of many other public bodies in terms of accountability and transparency.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been introduced to increase accountability and value for money <Col N="136"/>since the Local Government Act was enacted in 2001. Local authority draft budgets must be considered by the authority's corporate policy group. Local authorities are empowered to establish local audit committees to review audit reports and accounts. I reject any suggestion that local authorities are not accountable, or do not show that they are delivering value for money. I do not know if it is appropriate for those of us who have queries to speak about individual problems in this House, given that the relevant officials can be placed under close scrutiny on these issues at individual local authority level. We may no longer have the right to conduct such scrutiny personally, but our party colleagues can certainly do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring suggested that the number of persons employed at local government level has increased in recent times. This is untrue, as the opposite is the case. Since the Government decided to reduce public service numbers, the number of persons employed in local authorities has decreased by approximately 1,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring also asked for information about spotlights on cars. Like some other issues that were raised during this debate by Members, it is now a matter for the Minister for Transport.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o'clock</TimeSt><P>Deputy McCormack raised the question of tax reliefs for disabled drivers. A scheme of relief which is in existence provides for a range of tax reliefs in connection with the purchase and use of vehicles by qualifying disabled drivers, passengers and organisations involved in the transport of persons with qualifying disabilities. An interdepartmental review group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and including representatives of the Departments of Health and Children, Finance and Social and Family Affairs has presented its report on the scheme to the Minister for Finance. The report is being considered by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who is the responsible Minister in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill gives legal effect to the measure which was introduced last November. The general purpose allocation of &euro;752 million this year represents an increase of 14% on the allocation in 2003 and is 122% more than the corresponding allocation for last year. It does not make sense for Members to say that the money being given by the Exchequer to the local government fund is not being put to good effect, as it is being used well. The increase of 5% which was provided for last November will raise an additional &euro;34 million in motor tax. All of this funding will be allocated directly to non-national roads. The 2003 non-national roads allocation <Col N="137"/>from the local government fund of &euro;394 million has been increased by &euro;34 million to &euro;428 million this year, which is an enormous amount of money. The charges made by the Opposition do not make sense.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the increase in motor tax is desirable and will provide an important funding contribution towards the non-national road <Col N="138"/>network this year and, thereby, allow the continuation of the excellent overall improvements that have been made to the road system in recent years.</P>

      <sTitle>Community Employment Schemes.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It concerns the three-year rule for community employment schemes but only in those schemes relevant to disadvantaged people. For example, in Galway city there is an independent living group which had 18 employees of community employment schemes. This week four of those people reached the three-year limit and had to terminate their employment on the scheme, with the result that four people with physical disabilities no longer have personal assistants. The Minister of State will say that the independent living group can employ four more people, but that is not so easy. First, one must advertise for them and, second, it is very difficult to find people willing to take up the position of personal assistant. A personal assistant who works with a disadvantaged person, or one who uses a wheelchair, for 19.5 hours per week over three years develops a relationship with that person and knows what to do and how to do it.</P>
        <P>The Galway case is only one example. Every year over the next three years the independent living group will lose 18 personal assistants. As a result the people employed on the community employment scheme will return to unemployment assistance and receive &euro;25 per week less than they received on the community employment scheme. For the sake of &euro;25 the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment is ceasing the employment of those people on a community employment scheme. Through the Minister of State, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to exempt people working as personal assistants on community employment schemes. The work they do is very valuable to themselves and to those whom they assist, enabling them to lead independent lives in their own homes or in a community home.</P>
        <P>In the Galway example the four who have lost their assistants must return to institutional care or to their families and the four assistants will be <Col N="140"/>unemployed. The independent living group has advertised for people to take up those positions but cannot get them immediately, if at all, because they must pass security checks and be trained.</P>
        <P>This rule strikes at the people least able to defend themselves. I cannot understand why the T&aacute;naiste proceeded with the three-year rule, which came into effect in 2003, for people in this position. They do the most valuable work that any employees of a community employment scheme could do in looking after people and enabling them to lead independent lives, in institutional care or in their own homes, as happens in some cases. I appeal to the Minister of State to present the case to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>It is not fair to send in the Minister of State because he has a prepared script that may not respond to the points I raise. This is one of the frustrations of raising matters on the Adjournment. The Minister of State brings in a prepared script which he or she must put on the record. I want the Minister of State to ask the T&aacute;naiste to exempt people employed in community employment schemes who work as personal assistants to those with disabilities because it is impossible to replace the expertise and comradeship they have established with the person whom they are assisting. Those people are now being penalised. A wheelchair user who had a personal assistant was able to do his or her shopping and go to the cinema or elsewhere. However, he or she will no longer be able to do that because the three year rule dictates that the personal assistant must be sacked. Four personal assistants had their employment terminated in Galway this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McCormack for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Community employment provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the programme, participation levels have gradually been reduced in line with reduced levels of unemployment and there has been a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring of the programme in 1999, eligibility for participation in community employment by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. That change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE schemes and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training and education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals. The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. Participants are considered for an extension if, on <Col N="141"/>reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE, they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. F&Aacute;S currently has discretion to offer up to 20% of the total number of CE participants a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>As provided for in the PPF, consideration has been given to the mainstreaming of certain essential services provided through CE. In that regard, approximately 4,500 CE places in schools have been mainstreamed over the past number of years. This involved the appropriate degree of funding being transferred to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of relevant services in schools. In addition, approximately 2,300 places have peen provided on the social economy programme.</P>
        <P>Detailed discussions took place during 2002 involving the Department of Health and Children, the health boards, F&Aacute;S and sponsor groups with regard to the possible mainstreaming of health sector places which would include personal assistant services. However, due to the amount of additional funding required by the Department of Health and Children to mainstream these positions, and having regard to other major demands in the health budget, it was not possible to proceed with mainstreaming in this area.</P>
        <P>CE health sector places have been ring-fenced from any reductions that have taken place since March 2002. F&Aacute;S, which has responsibility for the day to day administration of the programme, makes every effort to ensure that places are maintained at the agreed level on ring-fenced schemes. However, it is important to remember that the primary purpose of CE is to provide short-term work experience and training opportunities for long-term unemployed persons and other disadvantaged groups with a view to facilitating their progression to work in the open labour market. It is imperative, especially with the reduced level of places available, that CE positions be vacated on a rolling basis to facilitate new participants and ensure that they are not blocked by participants who do not move on when their agreed participation period ends.</P>
        <P>The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy. F&Aacute;S is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while, at the same time, facilitating the support of community services. This allocation of &euro;351 million is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places across the three schemes brings clarity not only to the levels of activity which can be supported, but will <Col N="142"/>enable F&Aacute;S to give a clear commitment to support local community services over an agreed period of time.</P>
        <P>The future structure of the CE programme is under review by a group of senior officials and F&Aacute;S and this group will report to Ministers on the outcome of its deliberations shortly. In addition, F&Aacute;S has recently undertaken an internal review of the community employment and job initiative programmes, which will be published in due course. The senior officials intend to complete their deliberations shortly and the outcome will inform any future adjustments in the structure and the terms and conditions of these labour market measures. I assure the Deputy that I will bring this matter to the attention of his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.</P>

      <sTitle>School Closures.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The closure of St. Mary's secondary school on a phased basis is a serious blow to the local community I represent. The community to which I refer is based in the Ringsend, Irishtown and Pearse Street areas and was described at a recent local meeting about the closure as traditional working class.</P>
        <P>St. Mary's secondary school is on Haddington Road and it has served the area extremely well for more than 100 years. Great credit must be given to the Holy Faith Sisters for their dedication and commitment over that time. The nuns and teachers in the school are excellent and deserve great credit. Their dedication can be seen in the excellent results they have achieved over many years because of small class sizes. Many parents have told me that their children receive one to one dedicated schooling, which has resulted in better results.</P>
        <P>We are now being told that the school must close because it is no longer financially viable, as the grant from the Department of Education and Science does not cover all the outgoings, because of the reduction in the number of vocations and because of what are called demographics &mdash; there are fewer people attending the school. I will come back to the financial problems shortly. As regards demographics, that argument is not easy to understand, given that there is a rising population in the area. We saw that recently when the boundary of the Dublin South-East constituency remained the same. More apartments are being built in the area and more young people with small children are moving to it. Where will these children, particularly the girls, go to secondary school?</P>
        <P>Such is the problem in the area that the principal of Westland Row CBS, Mr. Ken <Col N="143"/>Duggan, has suggested that the girls' and boys' schools should be amalgamated and that the new school should be located in the Dublin docklands area. That is an excellent idea, but it is a long way off. In the meantime, we must deal with this problem. Where will girls in the area go to secondary school? There is no answer to that question. Many schools in the area have been closed and people are now left with the choice of Muckross Park College, which is the closest, going outside the area or going to fee paying schools. These are not viable or acceptable options for many parents in the area.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science must think strategically. It needs to explore all the options and it needs to invest in the school. It needs to do everything it can possibly do to keep the school open. It cannot act unilaterally and needs the co-operation of the school and particularly of the trustees, who now have to report their intentions after the last meeting with the parents. I have asked the school authorities to give the parents some hope in this regard. If the trustees have decided they are to close the school, sell the property and make a profit, there is little we can do. I hope the Minister and his Department officials will liaise with the trustees to ensure the school remains open. We had a similar problem in the constituency with St. Anne's. What happens to the money a religious order receives on the sale of such a property? It is probably of little benefit to the religious order. The Department needs to decide what will be done for a growing population in the area and I hope the Minister of State will propose some solutions tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in this House as it affords me the opportunity on behalf of the Department of Education and Science to outline to this House the current position regarding the proposed closure of St. Mary's secondary school, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. St. Mary's secondary school is an all-girls' post-primary school with a current enrolment of 149 pupils. The trustees of the school, the Sisters of the Holy Faith, have indicated to the Department that they are not in a position to continue to provide post-primary education in St. Mary's secondary school. Accordingly, they intend to close the school on a phased basis by June 2006.</P>
        <P>As trustees of St. Mary's secondary school, the decision to withdraw from trusteeship and management of the school is a matter for the Sisters of the Holy Faith. Therefore, it is not within the capacity of the Department of Education and Science to reverse the decision taken by the trustees to close the school.</P>
        <P>The issues for the Minister for Education and Science are to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after in the period up to the closure of the school in 2006, and to ensure there will be sufficient post-primary educational <Col N="144"/>provision in the area for pupils who would normally have enrolled in this school. In this context, the Department is involved in an analysis of the three post-primary schools serving the needs of the south inner city area of Dublin. Crucial to this analysis is the exploration of the possibility of a single school development to cater for the 444 pupils currently enrolled in the existing schools. This exploration is being conducted in consultation with the relevant trustees. Additionally, an integral element of this process will entail an examination of accommodation options for the proposed development.</P>
        <P>The school planning section of the Department will work assiduously to ensure that there is adequate provision in the south inner city area to meet the educational needs of post-primary pupils in the south inner city area. I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to discuss this matter in this House.</P>

      <sTitle>Hepatitis C Incidence.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising one aspect of the ten-year blood scandal saga, which is as scandalous as any of the others with which we are familiar. It is the failure to inform some blood donors that they had tested positive for hepatitis C, which precluded them from protecting other members of their family and loved ones, and from seeking treatment in a timely manner. In other words people with a highly infectious disease were stopped from seeking treatment, which could have prevented their illness from deteriorating and also protecting members of their family.</P>
        <P>Although this was known for some time it was not until Donor L initiated court action that the full implications of this scandal became known and were widely discussed. At that time it became clear that Donor L was not the only one involved and there were possibly another 27 people who had not been informed. Both Positive Action and Transfusion Positive expressed concern that there were many cases of people who had not been informed. This among other matters prompted the Minister into promising an inquiry into this aspect, which is just one part of the long-running blood scandal.</P>
        <P>For reasons, the details of which are far too arcane for me to cover in the short time available to me, no inquiry took place. At least one reason for this was that interests within the BTSB, the body to be examined and investigated, did not want it for a variety of reasons. I do not even understand why it was consulted or asked and it is beyond understanding as to why the Minister succumbed to its wishes. The only explanation is that there is an unhealthy overlap between the Minister's electoral interests, the Southern Health Board and the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and that this conflicts with the public interest. I would be interested to hear <Col N="145"/>if the Minister has another reason for the failure to establish this inquiry.</P>
        <P>The information made available to my colleague, Deputy Hogan, under the Freedom of Information Act gives cause for serious concern in this regard and also in regard to other matters which should form the subject matter of an inquiry. For instance why did both the BTSB and the expert group it set up to investigate the sites where blood testing should occur change their minds in favour of dual site testing to include Cork rather than the original decision which was single site testing in Dublin, which is more in line with international best evidence and experience. This is particularly surprising given the extremely poor record of the BTSB in any form of recording and communicating of information with others and even within the board itself. The Cork dimension seems to have constrained the Minister and resulted in a less than optimal solution from the public point of view.</P>
        <P>This is no longer a matter the Minister can let slide. I am not calling for a tribunal like any of the other tribunals we have had in the past into financial scandals, bribery or corruption. These are matters that can wait some months without impacting the public or the public interest. However, this is a matter on which the clock may be ticking in a real way for some people. People may have been infected who have not been informed and this must be investigated. While the Minister considered this matter sufficiently serious to order an inquiry, he has allowed it to be delayed for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister is now suggesting this matter might now be better investigated after the Commissions of Investigation Bill has been processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is rubbish. It is totally unacceptable to postpone an inquiry, which may be a matter of life and death for some people, to wait for a Bill that has not even been read once in the House. It represents yet another unacceptable delaying tactic.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the seriousness of this allegation: it is criminal to delay any further. The Minister must establish an independent inquiry now regardless of whose toes he steps on. He owes it to those who have been damaged over the years by the omissions, actions or inactions of those who have managed or mismanaged the blood supply on behalf of the State. He also owes it to those who will give or receive blood tomorrow or who will need it in the future and to those who will depend on the existence of a stable, efficient, well-managed and well-resourced blood supply and a service in which we can all have confidence. While the inquiry is outstanding no such confidence can exist in the blood supply.</P>

	<P>The Finlay tribunal, which reported in 1997, noted that between November 1991 and December 1993, donors in the Munster region who tested positive for hepatitis C were not <Col N="146"/>immediately informed of their test results. One of these donors, known to the tribunal as Donor L, gave evidence that he had made blood donations regularly between 1986 and July 1993. He expressed considerable distress and anger that he had tested positive to HCV antibodies in December 1991 and that from then until November 1993, despite making donations on a number of occasions, he was at no time informed that they were being used for the purpose of testing only, nor was he informed that any form of positive test had arisen.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the Munster director of the IBTS gave evidence to the Finlay tribunal that the HCV screening available in 1991 was insufficiently precise to warrant the risk of upsetting a donor who was tested in the ordinary way, as was Donor L, by informing him of a positive result. She felt that the best course to adopt was to continue screening his blood on a regular basis by sending him an ordinary donor's notification card from time to time to see whether the apparent reaction would vary and also in the expectation that confirmatory testing of a more certain kind would become available very soon. She denied that this occurred inadvertently or through want of care. It was, she said, a conscious decision which she made with great difficulty concerning the position of donors who screened positive on the introduction of the test in October 1991. This was apparently implemented as a general policy and not merely in one case.</P>
        <P>In 2000 my Department was advised by the Chief State Solicitor that Donor L had initiated proceedings in the High Court seeking damages arising from the delay in notifying him of his infection with hepatitis C. I have been cited, as Minister for Health and Children, as one of the respondents in that action. As part of the preparations for this, my Department made detailed inquiries of the IBTS, in particular seeking information on the number of other donors who had been treated in a similar fashion. It also brought the matter to the attention of Transfusion Positive and Positive Action, the main support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through infected anti-D or blood transfusions, to determine what action needed to be taken to promote the interests of the donors concerned. I and my officials had a number of meetings with the two groups and the IBTS during 2002. Arising from these discussions, the IBTS agreed to contact the donors regarding the delay in notification. This was done in August and September 2002 and appropriate counselling and other supports were offered to all.</P>
        <P>The IBTS wrote to 30 donors in total. A total of 17 donors responded to the written communication from the IBTS &mdash; 11 by telephone, two by letter and four through their solicitors. In general, donors called to request access to the information held on file about their cases and they did not discuss any concerns in detail. Some donors were upset at having the <Col N="147"/>matter reopened. A number of donors requested that the information be provided to their solicitors and this has been done. Following discussions between my Department and the support groups, it was agreed initially to establish an independent investigation of donor notification procedures, to be undertaken by senior counsel, in a non-statutory format, assisted by relevant experts. The board of the IBTS, however, considered that the matter should be subject to a judicial inquiry &mdash; again, on further investigation, of a non-statutory kind. Subsequently, the support groups indicated that the matter required the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry. The Deputy said earlier that she does not believe a tribunal is the correct response.</P>
        <P>I have already informed the groups that the Commissions of Investigation Bill, when enacted, will provide an appropriate mechanism for such an investigation.</P>

      <sTitle>Social Welfare Benefits.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not seeking a commission of inquiry at the moment but, depending on the Minister's answers, I might be. I am here to ask that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs explain the discrepancy between payments to a family which voluntarily raises an orphaned child and the vastly superior payments to a family which raises an orphaned child who has first been the subject of a care order by the health board. This is one of the many anomalies that exists in the social welfare system. I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for children is here. I hope we can obtain a resolution of this issue once and for all.</P>
        <P>In the north inner city, in my constituency of Dublin Central, two families experienced tragedy. In each case the mother died and a child was orphaned. Both immediate families did the honourable thing and voluntarily took responsibility for rearing the children. They put roofs over their heads, fed them, raised them and provided medical care &mdash; one of the children requires constant medical attention and attendance at the Mater Hospital &mdash; as well as educational and family care. In all of this they saved the State a substantial sum of money. Institutional care was avoided and happy family contexts were provided for raising the children.</P>
        <P>However, the State has the unhappy knack of taking advantage of families' generosity and voluntary assumption of responsibilities. As a result, each family is in receipt of a weekly payment of &euro;97, which is now going up to &euro;107. This is called the orphan's payment by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, if care orders had been signed and the children had been taken into the care of the <Col N="149"/>health board, the families fostering the children would be in receipt of &euro;289. Effectively, the families are penalised for saving the children the trauma of being taken into care and then removed from an institution. The ridiculous nature of the system is highlighted by the fact that in each case the same children would be involved and the costs of raising them would be the same. It is simply a matter of a minor mechanical difference in dealing with the care of the children.</P>
        <P>Trying to find out anything about the matter is a trying and circuitous business. One must contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which refers one to the health board, followed by Park House, a social worker and the health board again. The message eventually obtained is that this is how it is. The rules were made and there is to be no change. One is told it is the way things are, as though it were cast in stone. It is not good enough. Children should be treated equally. I ask the Minister of State to correct this anomaly and not to discriminate against the many children and families in this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello for giving me the opportunity to address the issues involved. The Deputy will be aware that the orphan's payment is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I understand from that Department that under social welfare legislation, an allowance may be paid in respect of an orphan by way of an orphan's contributory allowance, based on social insurance, or a means-tested non-contributory orphan's pension. These payments are intended to provide income maintenance in respect of children who satisfy certain qualifying criteria. Payment is made to the guardian of the orphan. &ldquo;Guardian&rdquo; is not defined and is generally taken to be the person having the care of the child.</P>
        <P>The definition of an orphan, introduced in 1995 includes children where one or both parents are still alive but have abandoned or refused or failed to provide for them. This approach was seen as a necessary response to changes in social and family circumstances, that is, a large number of children being informally, without formal health board intervention, cared for by relatives due to a variety of personal circumstances. There are approximately 1,500 orphans in receipt of such payments. The Deputy referred to two such cases, but in the instances to which he referred, the children are orphans in that both parents had died.</P>
        <P>The position of children who are the subject of care orders is that under the Child Care Act 1991, health boards are required to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Where a child requires care or protection that he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is taken into care, the health board must take the child into care and provide the most appropriate form of alternative care for that child. The foster care <Col N="150"/>allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the health board and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995.</P>
        <P>Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>
        <P>The allowance was restructured in August 2001 in response to recommendations contained in the working group on foster care report Foster Care &mdash; A Child Centred Partnership. The report recommended that discretionary payments made in addition to the basic foster care allowance should be abolished and that the foster care allowance should be substantially increased. As of 1 January 2004, the foster care allowance stands at &euro;289.50 per week for children under 12 years and &euro;316.50 per week for children of 12 years and over. The foster care allowance is currently paid in respect of approximately 4,000 children.</P>
        <P>These recommendations were made on the basis of the views that were strongly expressed at consultation meetings held by the working group and the views expressed by the Irish Foster Care Association. The new scheme was put in place to achieve the objective of ensuring that foster carers are adequately recompensed for looking after their foster children without having to go through the process of making claims for discretionary payments.</P>
        <P>The issue of care by relatives was dealt with in detail in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care &mdash; A Child Centred Partnership. The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives. These are that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that placements with relatives should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; that a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care and that placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</P>
        <P>The working group also discussed the possibility that some children are placed in the care of health boards to provide income support for the family in relation to the child. The group <Col N="151"/>was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate. Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Children should only be brought into the care of the health board if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the child care legislation. In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child's individual best interests.</P>
        <P>I have indicated that the payment of the orphan's allowance or pension is a matter for the <Col N="152"/>Department of Social and Family Affairs. These payments are made in accordance with social welfare legislation. With the exception of children who are placed in care under the foster care or relative care regulations, these payments are made directly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, normally to the child's guardian. The circumstances in which these payments are made and the level of payment are determined by that Department.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, and following on my Budget Statement regarding carbon energy taxation last December, I published a carbon energy tax consultation paper prepared by my Department on 31 July of 2003. This consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received in this Department by 30 September 2003, but extra time was given where requested by organisations to complete their submissions. Some 117 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper. The current step in this process is the examination of submissions received in the Department. All relevant issues, including the case of tax neutrality to accompany carbon taxation, will be taken into account in the consideration of the proposal. As part of the consultation process, these submissions are now also available publicly via my Department's website.</P>

	<P>The treaty establishing the European Community provides that members of the European Court of Auditors shall be chosen from among persons who have belonged to external audit bodies in their respective countries or who are especially qualified for the office. The treaty also provides that the European Parliament is to be consulted on appointments to the court.</P>
        <P>It is important that the court's operation is based on sound judgement, independence and integrity as well as conforming to the highest professional standards. This is well served by having members from all member states with an intimate knowledge of their own State's administration and culture. Ideally, the members of the court also should have a mix of backgrounds and relevant experience. The current Irish member of the court, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, and previous Irish members fully met the requirements for appointment to the court and have served the court with distinction.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the treaty provisions for the court will, like all other treaty provisions, be subsumed into the current Inter-Governmental Conference which is intended to lead to the adoption of an EU constitution. In this respect, the draft EU constitution produced by the European Convention last year retained the existing arrangements for appointing members to the court. There is a widespread consensus among member states that the existing arrangements for the court are working well and should be retained. The priority of the Irish Presidency is to do what we can to facilitate and expedite agreement on the draft EU constitution. As such, we will be seeking to consolidate and build on the existing consensus to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recommendations made in the report commissioned by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. However, the Irish Government and most member states are satisfied with the structure, operation and integrity of the court. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the fine work the court has done in its continued commitment to protecting the financial interests of the EU.</P>

	<P>I have not concluded my consideration of this matter. As I informed the House previously, I received <Col N="155"/>correspondence from the Standards in Public Office Commission in December about certain provisions of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. That correspondence concerned section 21 of the Standards in Public Office Act, which provides for evidence of tax compliance on the part of ordinary Members of the Houses to be furnished to the standards commission. Specifically, a tax clearance certificate, which would have issued to the person not more than nine months before and not more than nine months after the election date, and a statutory declaration, which was made by the person not more than one month before and not more than one month after the election date, must be furnished to the commission.</P>
        <P>Section 21(4) provides for investigation by the Standards in Public Office Commission where a person contravenes subsection (1). In a letter to me of 2 December 2003 the Standards in Public Office Commission suggested that consideration be given to amending subsection (4) to provide that the commission may, where appropriate, investigate whether evidence of tax compliance provided to it by Members of the Oireachtas under subsection (1) was &ldquo;false or misleading&rdquo;. It was necessary to consult internally within my Department on the suggestion made by the Standards in Public Office Commission and, following that consultation, to seek the advice of the Attorney General on certain issues. I will give further consideration to this matter when the advice of the Attorney General has been received.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and 60 of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient <Col N="156"/>identity information. The number of connected entities in relation to cases under investigation is nearly 700.</P>
        <P>To date a total of &euro;38.74 million has been received, mostly by way of payments on account, in respect of 79 cases. This is made up of 69 cases involving Ansbacher or Ansbacher type arrangements with payments received of &euro;31.02 million and ten other cases involving offshore funds or deposits with payments received of &euro;7.72 million. The 60 cases which have concluded settlements with Revenue consist of 28 cases which were settled with payments amounting to &euro;16.10 million, included in the amount to which I have just referred, 25 non-resident cases which are covered by the provisions of double taxation agreements, five which had no additional liability and two which were covered by the 1993 amnesty provisions.</P>
        <P>The information in the High Court inspectors' report has been carefully considered as regards the tax liabilities of the persons concerned. Revenue has also made an application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the report. The matter was heard by the High Court in November 2002 and judgement is reserved.

        <Quest>if surpluses in the social insurance fund and the pension contributions of public servants will be lodged to the national pensions reserve fund.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act provides for the establishment of a pensions reserve fund to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions from the year 2025. The Act further provides that the annual contribution to the fund by the Exchequer shall be an amount equivalent to 1% of gross national product. There is no provision to lodge either the surplus of the social insurance fund or the pension contributions of public servants into the fund.</P>
        <P>I gave consideration to transferring the social insurance fund surplus into the national pensions reserve fund when drafting the legislation. However, I decided against that option for a number of reasons. The social insurance fund, which holds the proceeds of employer, employee and self-employed social insurance contributions, makes benefit payments for a wide range of social insurance contingencies. As well as old age, it also pays for disability, unemployment and other benefits. Therefore, while the national pensions reserve fund was established to meet the sole contingency of old age, the social insurance fund meets a range of demands, many of which are short term in nature. Having regard to this, it would be impractical to try to apportion the surplus between these various contingencies. In addition, given the liability structure, the wide range of contingencies covered and future demands on the fund, it is likely that it will be necessary to draw down on the reserves of the social insurance fund long before the initial 2025 draw down from the national pensions reserve fund.</P>
        <P>As regards public sector pension schemes, the majority of these schemes are financed on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis. The purpose of the national pensions reserve fund is to move from a complete reliance on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis for pension funding to a situation of a partial funding of future liabilities. The national pensions reserve fund will not meet the full cost of future Exchequer pension liabilities. The annual contribution of 1% of gross national product is considered to be the most appropriate, feasible <Col N="158"/>and efficient way to make the necessary Exchequer contribution to the partial funding of all future Exchequer social welfare and occupational pension liabilities on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that each year all PAYE taxpayers receive a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point setting out their entitlements. This certificate is accompanied by a detailed letter setting out a wide range of information. In 2004, this accompanying letter contained information about the main personal tax credits available for 2003-04; the tax rates and tax bands for 2003-04; the exemption limits for single, widowed and married persons; benefit-in-kind changes; how to claim medical expenses tax relief; mortgage interest and medical insurance relief; services charges relief; and how to claim an adjustment to your tax credit certificate by telephoning a lo-call number shown.

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two ways in which a taxpayer may have been in breach of the amnesty, first, in making a declaration that he or she did not comply with the terms or, second, a declaration was not made. I am informed that Revenue does not have figures for the number of detected breaches of the amnesty. As a result of the confidentiality conditions built into the 1993 amnesty legislation, such breaches are difficult to identify and prove. No individual has been successfully prosecuted to date for failure to comply with the obligatory provisions of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993.</P>
        <P>Growing numbers of individuals and companies have been successfully prosecuted in recent years as a result of Revenue investigations and although these investigations have in some <Col N="160"/>instances involved consideration of possible amnesty breaches, it was not possible in any of them to obtain the evidence necessary to meet the required standards of beyond reasonable doubt in relation to those offences. Revenue's criminal investigation programmes have been refocused recently with the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division, one of whose functions is to increase the number of prosecutions for serious tax evasion. Where in the course of investigations amnesty offences are identified, they will be investigated with a view to taking a criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P>Given the real evidential difficulties which arise in successfully bringing a case through the courts for amnesty non-compliance, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are making every effort to ensure the law is applied in the manner intended.</P>

        <P>I established the Revenue powers group, chaired by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, to examine Revenue's main statutory powers and report to me on any changes needed. I am grateful to the group for its considerable efforts in producing the report within a demanding timescale. I have decided to allow a period for debate and public reflection on the many and varied issues with which the report treats. Thus, with one important exception that would have arisen anyway, a power to allow Revenue access information held by a non-resident entity over which a domestic financial institution has control, I am not implementing any of its recommendations in this year's Finance Bill but will be reviewing all of the group's recommendations for next year's Bill.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have begun examining the contents of the report. Given my view that it is appropriate to allow time for these issues to be considered, I do not consider it appropriate to comment at this time on individual recommendations, such as those concerning new powers.</P>
        <P>The Revenue powers group did not make any recommendation concerning resources for Revenue, but I have made sure that Revenue have sufficient resources to carry out their functions. Since 2000 I have allocated 400 additional staff to Revenue to give key work areas, such as audit, the extra capacity needed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no cap on the aggregate value of special tax reliefs which can be claimed by an individual. However, as the Deputy may be aware, in budget 1998 I announced, as and from 3 December 1997, that an annual cap of &euro;31,750 would apply on the amount of capital allowances that an individual taxpayer could claim against non-rental income in regard to capital expenditure incurred on certain industrial buildings. Any unrelieved capital allowances can be carried forward for offset against the individual's rental income. Industrial buildings such as factories, docks, hotels, etc. are affected by this provision as well as buildings under the area based schemes such the urban, rural, town renewal schemes and a range of other schemes such as multi-storey car parks, private hospitals, etc. There is also a cap of &euro;31,750 on the annual amount that can be claimed by individual investors under the business expansion scheme and as well as cap of &euro;31,750 on the maximum annual amount that can be invested in a qualifying film under the scheme of relief for investment in films. In the case of the latter <Col N="162"/>scheme, this is further restricted as only 80% of total investment is eligible for relief under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In my response to the D&aacute;il debate on Second Stage of the Finance Bill, I referred to the fact that the special reliefs provide undoubted economic and social benefits. On the other hand, they narrow the tax base, have a cost, and inevitably are used by high earners to reduce their tax bill. A judgment must be made as to whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. It is my view that imposing an overall cap on the aggregate value of special tax reliefs which can be claimed by an individual would undermine the effectiveness of many incentive schemes in providing the economic and social benefits referred to above.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I took the first available opportunity in budget 2004 to deal with an unacceptable interpretation of the VAT law in this area. Developers have attempted to avoid VAT by artificial means by attempting to put themselves in a position where they are not entitled to take a deduction for VAT incurred on the development of a site and thereby claimed that they did not have to charge VAT on the sale of such sites. This is an abuse of VAT law as there are few cases, if any, where a developer is not entitled to a deduction for VAT suffered on the development of residential sites.</P>
        <P>On budget night, it was then indicated that the potential loss of VAT in respect of one case could amount to &euro;18 million. However, I am now <Col N="163"/>informed by the Revenue Commissioners that while it is not possible to establish with any certainty the total amount of tax that would have been paid but for this particular VAT scheme the &euro;18 million figure identified in one case is now significantly less. To date the particular interpretation of VAT law has been found to be in use in a total of 20 cases but a countrywide investigation is ongoing in relation to other cases in which there are indications that the scheme may have been used. Revenue continue to contest the validity of the scheme with a view to recouping any VAT not correctly accounted for.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners first became aware of the use of such an interpretation in a number of cases last summer. The Revenue Commissioners had previously encountered isolated similar instances of efforts by taxpayers to take sites out of the VAT net. These had been challenged successfully in most instances on a case by case basis. The Revenue Commissioners are devoting considerable resources to identifying the incidence of the scheme and pursuing the correct VAT liability.</P>

	<P>The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was established on 1 January 2003. One of its functions is to advise State authorities on the optimal means of financing the cost of public investment projects to achieve value for money. The NDFA's role includes advising on the financing and risk evaluation of Ireland's public private partnership procurement projects and raising or arranging finance for national development plan projects. In this respect it provides a centralised expert service to Departments and certain other State authorities. In addition to its advisory role, the NDFA has the power to raise funding itself or through special purpose companies up to a total of &euro;5 billion to finance infrastructure projects. I understand that this facility has not been invoked so far.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the agency has completed or substantially completed its input on six infrastructure projects with a combined value of over &euro;700 million and has organised EIB and other private lending facilities of some &euro;250 million for these projects.</P>
        <P>In my recent budget speech, I initiated a major change in the financial treatment of capital spending by introducing five year capital envelopes. These envelopes include a commitment to keep the level of Exchequer funded capital investment at close to 5% of GNP over the period 2004-08. A significant development in these capital envelopes are specific targets for projects financed through public private partnership or by the NDFA. These targets increase from 3% of total spending in 2004 to 15% by 2008 and amount to &euro;3.6 billion in total. The NDFA will have an important role to play in advising Departments and agencies in regard to the optimum financing of these projects to achieve value for money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may know, where information in regard to individual reliefs is provided separately on tax returns form it can be captured electronically and may be examined centrally by Revenue. An example of this would be the data relating to the artists exemption where virtually all the information relating to numbers of claimants and the amounts exempted from tax can be obtained.</P>
        <P>Aside from the tax returns forms, the cost in terms of tax foregone of other provisions, such as urban renewal or the business expansion scheme, can be estimated through the information caught by certification processes and a number of schemes such as tonnage tax are availed of by few claimants and can be gauged from a survey of returns.</P>
        <P>However, it is important that data be improved to facilitate assessments of such expenditures and reliefs. The Department of Finance has been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to investigate information and data capture issues arising with a view to producing possible solutions. The challenge is twofold: the first is to identify the optimal manner of obtaining the information that is required to monitor and cost existing reliefs and the second is to obtain such information with due regard to not overburdening compliant taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Bearing this in mind the Revenue Commissioners will be introducing a number of changes to the forms relating to the annual return of income in respect of the tax year 2004 and to the P35 form, which is returned to Revenue at end year with totals for earnings and deductions for each employee, in respect of the tax year 2005. These changes will yield additional information regarding the cost of various tax reliefs and relief in regard to pensions.</P>
        <P>I will include amendments on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2004 to underpin these changes. In addition, the use of the Revenue on-line system, ROS, has been increasing and will continue to be encouraged. Returns filed in this way can readily accommodate information data capture in relation to tax reliefs being claimed without overburdening the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>In addition to keeping schemes under review, especially in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill process, to ensure they continue to meet the purpose or purposes for which they were introduced, detailed reviews of the costs and benefits of various tax reliefs are carried out from time to time. Recent examples of this are the reviews carried out on tax reliefs for urban <Col N="166"/>renewal, films and the business expansion scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Commission on 10 February last published its communication on its proposals for the future financing of the EU in the post-2006 period. The communication initiates a negotiation on the multi-annual framework for the EU budget, otherwise known as the financial perspective, for the period after 2006. The current framework, known as Agenda 2000, covers the period 2000-06. It took some two years to negotiate and it can be expected that there will be a similarly protracted negotiation on the proposals now made in the Commission communication.</P>
        <P>The first significant consideration of the communication will be at the General Affairs and External Relations Council of Ministers meeting, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen for the Irish Presidency of the EU on 23 February.</P>
        <P>The Government is very conscious of its responsibilities as Presidency in ensuring an effective and even-handed conduct of the negotiations. In this respect the Council at its meeting will be giving preliminary consideration to the communication. The main result of this consideration is expected to be to initiate a process, or road-map, for the future negotiation rather than to enter into detailed negotiation at this early point.</P>
        <P>The Government's overall approach in the negotiations will be to seek to ensure that the final agreement is in the best interests both of the EU and Ireland. In this regard, we will be fully committed to achieving a balanced overall outcome that takes full account of all aspects. This would take into account the level of contributions, which is mainly from the Exchequer and, therefore, the taxpayer, spending on agriculture, which is of such vital importance to farmers, and the allocation for the Structural Funds, including the present Objective One Regions of the Union.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that some broad national positions are being staked out by some member states and that some of those have called for the maintenance of EU spending in real terms at its <Col N="167"/>current level but, as I have indicated, this will be a protracted negotiation and national positions will evolve in the course of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>With regard to the European Parliament, we would expect that the Parliament will continue to play the substantial and constructive role in the negotiation process that it has played since financial perspectives were introduced in the late 1980s. The 2000-06 financial perspective is encompassed by an Inter-Institutional Agreement, the IIA, of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure. The IIA allows for the agreement of the post-2006 financial perspective, failing which the expenditure ceilings set out in the IIA will continue.</P>
        <P>There is currently no treaty basis for the financial perspective. However, the current intergovernmental conference text provides for a treaty basis for the financial perspective which would consolidate Parliament's existing role in this very important area of policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The key responsibility for the evaluation, planning and execution of capital projects rests with line Departments and the relevant implementing agencies. My Department has a strong concern to promote the pursuit of optimal value for money by Departments and has provided guidance to Departments in this regard. This guidance is set out in the 1994 capital appraisal guidelines. These guidelines are designed to enhance the quality of project management and appraisal, including the conduct of more rigorous cost benefit analysis and to promote better value for money generally. My Department is drafting revised guidelines in the light of experience of the operation of the existing guidelines and of the implementation of infrastructure projects in recent years.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific proposal to establish an evaluation unit in my Department, I advise the Deputy that the NDP-CSF evaluation unit is an independent evaluation unit under the aegis of my Department which is co-financed by the Exchequer and the EU and has responsibility under the direction of the technical assistance monitoring committee for evaluation of the NDP operational programmes and related issues. In this regard it has engaged in, or overseen, a number of evaluations since the commencement of the NDP, including the evaluation of investment in key capital programmes such as the road network and in public transport. The NDP-CSF evaluation unit has also been engaging with <Col N="168"/>my Department in relation to the ongoing work on the revision of the capital appraisal guidelines.</P>
        <P>My Department co-ordinates the expenditure review initiative, ERI, under which Departments conduct internal evaluations or reviews of their key expenditure programmes or policy areas on the basis of centrally agreed criteria. Final responsibility for conducting reviews, submitting them for external quality assessment, disseminating their findings and implementing their recommendations rests with each individual Department. My Department also provides the secretariat to the expenditure review central steering committee, ERCSC, a committee chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and comprising a number of secretaries general and an external expert. The ERCSC supports the expenditure review process at a strategic level. This includes making recommendations on future reforms to the process.</P>
        <P>More generally the issue of the evaluative capacity of my Department will be kept under review in the context of the five year rolling capital envelopes framework which I announced in the 2004 budget, the ongoing work programme of the NDP-CSF evaluation unit and the review of the capital appraisal guidelines.</P>

	<P>It is a fundamental requirement for the above relief that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical <Col N="169"/>officer who is an official of the relevant health board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</P>
        <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>The report of the interdepartmental group on the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, which is under consideration in my Department, examines the criteria for eligibility and its recommendations as regards applicability are being looked at.</P>
        <P>Any consideration of a change to the scheme, will among other factors, have to take account of any cost implications. I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. The cost of reliefs, excluding annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;36 million in 2003, as compared with &euro;5.1 million in 1994.</P>
        <P>My Department has no involvement in the operation of the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal. However, I am informed that there is currently a backlog of appeals to be dealt with by the board. This is an indication of the level of demand for tax relief under the scheme. In addition, the backlog seems to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal.</P>
        <P>I am taking steps to improve the situation by expanding the size of the panel of doctors who sit on the board from the existing three doctors to five, which should facilitate more meetings of the board. The board currently requires all three members in attendance to hold a meeting.</P>

	<P>The Estimates outline the Government's main spending proposals and they are presented by the Minister for Finance to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il. The Minister for Finance normally presents the pre-budget or Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV, to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approximately two weeks before budget day. The post-budget or Revised Estimates Volume, REV, are normally presented to the D&aacute;il within eight weeks of the start of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Estimates by departmental Vote are then subject to individual scrutiny and approval by the relevant Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>As regards taxation, the financial statement on budget day outlines the main taxation measures proposed. The details of these proposed measures are contained in the accompanying budget book, which is distributed to Members on budget day. The budget and Finance Bill debates provide the House with the opportunity to give its views on these measures. I do not have any plans to amend the above arrangements. I would, however, inform the Deputy of some reforms introduced and ongoing consideration under way which are of relevance to his question.</P>
        <P>In my Budget Statement of 3 December 2003, I announced a major change in the financial treatment of capital spending through the introduction of rolling five year multi-annual capital envelopes. In implementing the new envelope system, I intend to allow Departments to carry over to the following year, subject to D&aacute;il <Col N="171"/>approval, any unspent Exchequer capital allocations, up to a maximum of 10% of each year's voted capital allocation.</P>
        <P>The capital envelopes, including the carryover arrangement, as well as leading to improvements in the management of capital programmes, will mean changes in the presentation of voted capital moneys to the D&aacute;il. The Finance Bill 2004 makes provision for the new carryover arrangement. Under the new arrangements, as envisaged in the Finance Bill, the D&aacute;il will be apprised of the amounts to be carried over in the AEV and it will be asked to approve the amounts on three separate occasions: the Appropriation Act of the carryover year; a ministerial order which must be approved by the D&aacute;il in the following year; and in the REV of the following year.</P>
        <P>Changes by way of tidying up or rationalisation of subheads and Votes have been made in the REV in recent years in consultation, as appropriate, with the Committee of Public Accounts. I intend to continue this process in the 2004 REV which will contain a significant rationalisation of the presentation of the subheads in the Agriculture and Food Vote.</P>
        <P>The 2003 public capital programme included new project level information. My Department will build on this presentational improvement and include material relating to the capital envelopes in the 2004 public capital programme which will be published, along with the REV, at the end of the month.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing on a pilot project under the aegis of my Department, involving the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Social and Family Affairs and Transport as pilot departments. The purpose of the pilot project is to examine ways of improving the links between departmental strategy statements, business planning and resource allocation and performance measurement. The results of this pilot project will be evaluated and consideration will be given as to whether this approach should be mainstreamed across Departments. If it is considered that the pilot project should be further developed and mainstreamed, I will bring proposals to Government and to the Committee of Public Accounts. I expect that the pilot project working group will furnish its draft report by the end of May.</P>

The group commissioned a number of reports and finished its work in March 2001. No further reports are expected from the group. The group's work contributed to the development of the Government's Green Paper on basic income which was published in September 2002 on foot of a commitment in the 1997 Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the different tax treatment of separated, cohabiting and married parents; and the rationale for this structure.</Quest>

	<P>Under the income tax code, married parents may elect for joint assessment, separate assessment or single assessment. Under joint assessment, the couple can transfer their personal credit and part of their bands between them. In the case of a married couple, where only one spouse has income, the facility for joint assessment allows the earning spouse to avail of the married personal credit, which is double the personal credit of a single person, and an increased standard band. In addition, the home carer tax credit may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax where one spouse remains working in the home to care for children or other dependent persons.</P>
        <P>Under separate assessment, each spouse is assessed on his or her own income, but one spouse's unused personal credit, reliefs and the transferable portion of the standard rate band may be transferred to the other spouse. This means that the tax payable under separate assessment does not exceed the tax payable had that couple elected to be jointly assessed. The home carer credit may not be claimed by spouses who opt for separate assessment.</P>
        <P>Under single treatment, each spouse is treated for tax purposes as if unmarried. Under single treatment, one spouse's unused credits, reliefs and standard rate band cannot be transferred to the other spouse. As with separate assessment, the home carer credit may not be claimed by spouses who opt for single assessment.</P>
        <P>Separated couples, whether parents or not, are generally treated as if unmarried &mdash; that is, assessed as single persons &mdash; but they may, where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place.</P>
        <P>The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that, where the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his or her spouse is granted to the paying spouse but the payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse. However, if the couple jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place, then the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them. On the other hand, non-legally binding maintenance payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse but the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them.</P>
        <P>Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse. The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>Parents who are separated from each other may each claim the one parent family credit in respect of their child where that child resides with the parent at any time during the year of assessment. However, a man and woman living together as man and wife are specifically excluded by the tax code from entitlement to the one-parent family tax credit.</P>
        <P>It is possible in certain circumstances for separated persons who jointly elect to be jointly assessed for tax purposes to claim the home carer tax credit. However, in such circumstances and because of the joint assessment, the one-parent family credit may not be claimed by either parent.</P>
        <P>Cohabiting parents are treated as single persons and there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. The tax system treats members of cohabiting couples, with or without children, as separate and unconnected individuals. Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. The home carer credit may not be claimed by cohabiting couples, as the credit is restricted to married persons who are jointly assessed for tax.</P>
        <P>To the extent that there are differences as outlined in the tax treatment of the different categories of couple, such difference arises from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirement to protect the institution of marriage. I have no plans to change the different treatments under the tax code at this time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The informal meeting of the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers of the European Union &mdash; ECOFIN Council &mdash; in Punchestown on 2 to 4 April will be one of the largest to take place in Ireland during the Irish <Col N="175"/>Presidency. Some 300 delegates and up to 400 media personnel will attend the event. The national delegations will be headed up by Ministers for Finance and governors of central banks, and will come from the ten new member states which join the EU on 1 May and from the 15 existing member states.</P>
        <P>The public will be kept fully informed on the meeting in a number of ways. As indicated, there will be a large media presence, which will be mainly from abroad but also from Ireland. The media presence is to ensure that the public not only in Ireland but in the rest of the EU, in the ten newly acceding countries and, indeed, even further afield, receive full reports on the discussions at the meeting.</P>
        <P>The foreign media will be interested not only in the meeting itself but also in Ireland generally and in the Irish economy. For instance, there is a particular appetite on the part of journalists from the ten new member states for appropriate information on how Ireland has benefited from membership of the EU, and special arrangements are being made to provide such information in this regard.</P>
        <P>There will also be full coverage of the meeting on the Irish Presidency website at <i>www.eu2004.ie</i> The Presidency website has grown enormously in importance in recent years as a means of public communication. I am fully satisfied that through the media reports and the website coverage the public will be kept very well informed on the meeting.</P>
        <P>With regard to the consultancy company being employed in relation to the meeting, the final price for the company's services is &euro;83,400. This company will augment my Department's preparations for the meeting through the provision of advice on the detailed programme management of the event. It will be appreciated that an event of this size makes exceptional demands on my Department's resources. I am satisfied that the employment, through competitive tender, of the firm of consultants to provide the support services outlined is fully justified and will contribute significantly to the success of the event itself.</P>

	<P>The following information has been supplied to my Department by the Office of the Information Commissioner. The number of review applications received by the Information Commissioner, and accepted as valid, increased <Col N="176"/>by 58% between 2002 and 2003, from 585 to 924. During 2003 the Information Commissioner completed reviews in 729 cases compared with 534 cases in 2002, which is an increase of 37%. Of the 729 cases completed in 2003 six were received in 1999; 62 were received in 2000; 81 were received in 2001; 143 were received in 2002 and 437 were received in 2003.</P>
        <P>At 31 January 2004 the Information Commissioner had 796 valid reviews on hand. The comparable figure for 31 January 2003 was 622 representing an increase in the on hand figure of 28% as between the two years. The 796 cases on hand are broken down as follows in terms of year of receipt: received in 1999 &mdash; two; received in 2000 &mdash; 19; received in 2001 &mdash; 182; received in 2002 &mdash; 130; received in 2003 &mdash; 451; and received in 2004 &mdash; 12 totalling 796.</P>
        <P>Figures are not available as to the average time taken to conclude reviews &mdash; appeals. The commissioner is dealing both with applications received as well as with older cases, including some applications received in 2000. Any average figure thus derived would need to be treated with caution. However, the commissioner hopes to be able to give fuller details of case completion time scales in her annual report for 2003.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>In this year's budget the goal of keeping inflation low took precedence and I made only limited changes to indirect taxes and excises. The effect of the indirect tax and excise changes will add less than 0.4% to the consumer price index. These changes will bring in &euro;243 million in additional revenue, which is needed to fund public services.</P>
        <P>Our rate of inflation moderated significantly over the course of 2003 and continues to do so. Inflation in January this year, as measured by the consumer price index, fell to 1.8%, its lowest level since October 1999. HICP inflation &mdash; the standardised measure for the EU &mdash; fell to 2.3% in January compared with a euro area average of 2.0%. This is the smallest differential with the euro area average since the beginning of monetary union. When compared to our major trading partners in December 2003, the rate of inflation measured 1.9% in the United States and 2.8% in the United Kingdom, compared with a rate of 1.9% here.</P>
        <P>Securing the competitiveness which has been so instrumental to our economic development, and thereby safeguarding jobs, is a key priority for this Government. The recent strengthening of the euro and its negative impact on our <Col N="177"/>competitiveness further emphasises the need to keep domestic costs down.</P>

        <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to the euro group meeting on 9 February which I chaired. I also chaired the ECOFIN Council meeting on the following day. As the Deputies will be aware, the euro group is an informal meeting of the 12 eurozone Finance Ministers which usually takes place on the evening before the ECOFIN Council.</P>
        <P>Regarding the substance of the meeting, I reported on my participation, as President of the euro group, in the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries, G7, in Florida on 7 February. The euro group noted the outcome of the G7 meeting and the agreement on the statement which was issued following that meeting. It noted that the statement which embodies the position agreed at euro group on 19 January was generally well received.</P>
        <P>We discussed updated stability programmes from eurozone members Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The stability programmes are submitted each year in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. Although these member states each have different budgetary and economic positions, the discussions reinforced the common commitment of all member states to pursuing sound public finances. Council opinions on each of these stability programmes together with a Council opinion on the convergence programme of the United Kingdom were adopted at the ECOFIN meeting on 10 February.</P>
        <P>At the euro group, we welcomed an update by the President of the Economic and Financial Committee composed of senior treasury and central bank officials on recent discussions regarding the arrangements for considering the position of acceding countries in relation to the exchange rate mechanism, ERM II. This is a part of the routine and necessary preparation given that acceding countries will be able to enter ERM II after 1 May next. In line with normal procedure, European Central Bank President Trichet participated in the euro group discussions.</P>

        <Quest>if he has considered the approach advocated by the ESRI for the deployment of funds set aside for the national pensions reserve fund.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4720/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of various views expressed by individuals and institutions concerning the national pensions reserve fund, NPRF. The NPRF was established in April 2001 with the objective to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055. I have no plans to alter the basic levels at which contributions are made to the NPRF.</P>
        <P>As explained in answers to other parliamentary questions in regard to the national pensions reserve fund, I am committed to the investment mandate of the fund as set out in section 19 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. This provides that, in investing fund moneys, the commission shall seek to optimise total financial return provided the level of risk is acceptable to the commission. Therefore, the commission is required to adopt a standard commercial investment policy and it does not have discretion to choose not to invest in particular sectors or companies for anything other than commercial reasons. Accordingly, there is nothing to prevent the commissioners from investing in projects in Ireland should they be satisfied that such investments are likely to yield a commercial return.</P>
        <P>I note that the ESRI has stressed the importance of infrastructural spending. It should be clear that the Government is fully committed to the development of the national infrastructure. As I announced in my recent Budget Statement, the Government will implement multi-annual capital investment envelopes over the period 2004 to 2008, providing for investment of about 5% of GNP per annum, which is twice the EU average.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>All tax reliefs and incentives were reviewed in the context of budget and Finance Bill 2004. On foot of that review and having considered the many pre-budget submissions which were made to me, I made a number of announcements regarding various tax reliefs in my 2004 Budget Statement <Col N="179"/>and these and other necessary provisions are now included in Finance Bill 2004 which was published earlier this month.</P>
        <P>The provisions include an extension of film relief to end 2008 with an increase in the amount per film that can be raised under the relief to &euro;15 million and significant administrative changes to tackle abuse. There is also an extension of the termination date for various area based tax incentive schemes to 31 July 2006 to relieve pressure on construction resources to meet the December 2004 deadline and allow for an orderly winding down of these schemes. In line with my position on targeted reliefs, the business expansion scheme and the associated seed capital scheme are also being extended to end 2006 and the company limit is being increased to &euro;1million. However, he extension and changes to both of these schemes are subject to a commencement order to allow clarification of potential EU state aid issues raised by the European Commission. It must be accepted that, of their nature, tax reliefs even where they can be justified for good public policy purposes will reduce the tax bills of those in the higher income bracket.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the figures referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General are extracted from a study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 2002 on the effective tax rates for high earning individuals based on the tax year 1999-2000. A similar study was undertaken in 1997. I placed copies of both these studies in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances on the expenditure on buildings in tax designated areas and on hotels was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. Subsequently, in the budget for 1998, I capped the amount of annual capital allowances on such buildings that could be set off against non-rental income and, in the case of hotels throughout most of the country, I abolished in total the capital allowances against non-rental income.</P>
        <P>The 2002 study indicates an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners in 1999-2000 compared with earlier years. However, it is clear that some high earners continue to achieve substantial reductions in their tax liability as a result of certain tax reliefs. The study indicates that property based capital allowances continue to be the chief instrument used by high income earners to reduce their taxable income by substantial amounts. It is also clear that the 1998 changes were not fully in effect by 1999-2000.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that all tax incentive schemes will continue to be kept under review, especially in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill process, seeking at all times to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between the provision of particular incentives for good public policy reasons and the availability of <Col N="180"/>opportunities for higher earners to reduce their tax exposure.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the 2003 SSIA annual returns are being furnished by all qualifying savings managers. The closing date for submission of these returns is 28 February 2004. Consequently, the latest date for which figures are available is for the year 2002. Based on these 2002 annual returns furnished by all qualifying savings managers, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2002 was 1,143,418 and the average monthly subscription was &euro;158.</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>It is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was &euro;531.9 million. The estimated cost in 2004 is &euro;540 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different if account holders change their monthly contributions. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme will be reduced by the exit tax to be received at the end.</P>
        <P>The special savings incentive account, SSIA, scheme was designed to be available to as many <Col N="182"/>people as possible. Its success is reflected in the significant number of people who have opened an account. The minimum contribution was set at &euro;12.50 per month, which is approximately &euro;3 per week, in the hope that this would encourage widespread participation in the scheme, including social welfare payment recipients and those on limited incomes.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, and following on my Budget Statement regarding carbon energy taxation in December 2002, I published a carbon energy tax consultation paper, prepared by my Department, on 31 July of last year. This consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received in my Department by 30 September 2003, but extra time was given where requested by organisations to complete their submissions. Some 117 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper. My Department is examining the submissions, many of which are quite lengthy and detailed. As part of the consultation process, <Col N="182"/>these submissions are now also available publicly via my Department's website.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the timescale for the decentralisation of 50 staff to Listowel is dependent on the availability of suitable accommodation in the location and the completion of the decentralisation implementation committee's implementation plan. A site has not yet been identified in Listowel. The Office of Public Works is undertaking an initial assessment of proposals.</P>
        <P>Civil servants have not yet been requested to volunteer for Listowel, so there is no information <Col N="183"/>on the numbers of volunteers. When the decentralisation implementation committee's implementation plan is completed the situation regarding sequencing, timescales, etc., will be clearer. This information will assist civil servants in making more informed choices.</P>

Arising from a voluntary disclosure programme, 254 individuals came forward and made voluntary disclosures. To date in excess of &euro;102 million has been received by the Commissioners. Revenue now intend to pursue vigorously those individuals who failed to come forward, using all powers available to them. Criminal prosecution will be considered in these cases subject to obtaining the relevant evidence. It is clear from some of the disclosures and the amount collected to date that some trusts were used to evade tax.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that arising from the clerical medical insurance-NIB inquiry, 452 cases have been targeted for investigation. To date, Revenue has collected &euro;48.91 million in tax, interest and penalties as a result of the investigations. This is made up of &euro;44.13 million paid in relation to 285 settled cases and &euro;4.78 million in respect of payments on account, in cases still under investigation. I understand that 110 cases were finalised with no additional liability arising.</P>
        <P>In 2003, three cases were prosecuted, with fines being imposed in two cases and a suspended sentence imposed in the other. The individuals concerned have also settled their tax affairs and paid the outstanding tax, together with interest and penalties. A further case is under investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>

        <Quest>the progress made to date by the offshore assets group of the Revenue Commissioners in its investigations into the use, for the purposes of tax evasion, of offshore bank accounts and trusts by Irish residents; the total amount of such funds identified to date; the total amount of tax collected in respect of these accounts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their offshore assets group was established in the autumn of 2001 for the purpose of enquiring into the use, for the purposes of tax evasion, of offshore bank accounts and trusts and the purchase of properties abroad. Since then the group has been examining this matter generally and currently has three financial institutions under inquiry in regard to the offshore activities of their subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>Arising from these inquires and other voluntary disclosures, the Revenue Commissioners have to date collected in excess of &euro;170 million from persons holding funds offshore. It is not possible for the Commissioners to establish the amount held abroad by Irish residents related to tax evasion as the funds held by Irish residents in offshore jurisdictions by financial institutions, including subsidiaries of Irish financial institutions, are obtained from a wide variety of sources. For example, such funds may include moneys relating to accident settlements, retirement gratuities, foreign earnings during periods of non-residence and so on which may be legitimate from an Irish tax point of view.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners will be inquiring into all offshore accounts and trusts held by Irish residents, including those held in offshore subsidiaries of Irish financial institutions. These <Col N="188"/>inquiries, while seeking to establish the tax liabilities of Irish residents holding offshore accounts, will also deal with the institutions' compliance with general tax law and with their obligations under the Finance Acts 1992 and 1995 to report to Revenue where they facilitated the opening of an offshore account or the sale of a material interest in an offshore fund.</P>

When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 26 financial institutions. No further applications for such orders are pending in regard to the bogus non-resident account inquiries.</P>
        <P>A large volume of information has been reported to Revenue under the High Court orders. Inquiry work in regard to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further general issues of inquiry letters were made in January, May, July, September and October 2003 and January 2004. These general inquiry letter issues relate to 91,000 non-resident accounts that had Irish addresses connected to them.

        <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress has been made in this the final phase of the investigations.

	<P>As Minister for Finance, I have not commented in the past on the euro exchange rate and I do not now propose to make any specific comment on the euro exchange rate. The Eurogroup Ministers&rsquo; meeting on 19 January 2004, with the ECB President Jean Claude Trichet, agreed the following statement on the euro exchange rate:</P>
        <P LI="1">Concerning exchange rates, our long-term strategy does not change: the euro must keep its value over the medium and long run, in line with economic fundamentals. In the present circumstances we particularly stress stability and we are concerned about excessive exchange rate moves.</P><Col N="190"/>

We continue to monitor exchange markets closely and co-operate as appropriate. In this context, we emphasise that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the international financial system, based on market mechanisms.</P>

	<P el="0">I am aware that concerns have been expressed in relation to the procurement of certain goods and services by the Office of Public Works in connection with the EU Presidency. Arising out of these concerns, I have initiated an independent examination of the matter. The purpose of the examination is to establish, in so far as possible, the facts in relation to this matter. I expect the results of the examination to be available shortly. It is not possible at this stage nor would it be correct for me to make any comment on the specifics of the situation pending the completion of the examination. However, steps are being taken to ensure that goods and services are supplied on the basis of competitive tendering that is transparent and fair.</P>
        <P>By way of general comment, it is obviously a matter of concern that any suggestion of impropriety should attach to the award of public contracts by the OPW or by any Government Department or agency. The OPW, through the activities of its various business units, including the Government Supplies Agency, plays a significant role in the procurement of property, construction and other goods and services on behalf of Departments and agencies. Because of the central role it plays in the procurement area, the OPW has consistently striven to ensure that it conforms to the highest possible standards of fairness, transparency, integrity and value in the awarding of public contracts. I believe that it achieves this objective across the broad range of its services.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>It is the general policy of the OPW that all procurement activity in the organisation abides by the principles and rules set out in the national public procurement guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and in the EU public procurement directives. In essence, this means that contracts for the supply of goods and services should be awarded by way of competitive tender where practicable.</P>
        <P>When the results of the independent examination become available, I will consider these carefully and take whatever steps I consider appropriate in the circumstances. My sole objective will be to ensure that the integrity of the procurement process in the OPW is maintained to its current high standards and strengthened where necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the importance of the service provided to the coroners by the State Laboratory and the impact it inevitably has on relatives of people whose deaths are the subject of inquests at a time of great distress. I know the management of the laboratory share that sensitivity and constantly monitor the service by reviewing available resources, outsourcing possibilities and complexity of analyses.</P>
        <P>Additional resources have been allocated to the toxicology section and there has been a substantial increase in the number of analyses completed. However, there is still a backlog of cases, due to an increase of 50% in the past two years in the number of cases referred, and a general increase in the complexity of the analyses required.</P>
        <P>A range of measures are being taken at present to reduce the turnaround time of samples sent to the laboratory and processed by its toxicology section. Additional priority is to be given to the coroners' cases over other work of the section. <Col N="192"/>Laboratory management are also reviewing the procedures and processes in the toxicology area with a view to automating as much as possible.</P>
        <P>The possibilities of reducing the complexity of testing were discussed between the State Laboratory and the coroners and their representatives, as doing so would have an immediate impact on turnaround times. However, it was not considered possible to reduce the complexity of tests performed by the laboratory given the constant demand from families for comprehensive analysis, the increasing complexity of the cocktail of drugs potentially taken by victims which requires sequential analyses to be carried out and coroners' requirement for quality analytical data, which will withstand scrutiny in a court.</P>
        <P>The State Laboratory is relocating to Backweston in the summer and it is expected that the new laboratory there will, when the move is completed, enhance the quality of service provided to all its clients including the coroners' service.</P>

	<P>Competitiveness is a key priority of the Irish Presidency. In the area of financial services, including insurance, my priority is to make progress on the completion of the financial services action plan.</P>
        <P>This plan aims, among other measures, to improve the functioning of the Single Market, to the benefit of insurance policyholders and other consumers of financial services. It does so by removing barriers to cross-border trade in financial services and thus increasing the range of choice available to consumers.</P>
        <P>Directives on insurance solvency and insurance mediation have already been approved under the plan. The insurance solvency directive sets new solvency margin requirements for insurance companies. This increases the amount of capital that a company must hold to help meet unexpected events and thus offers increased assurance to policyholders, wherever they are living. The insurance mediation directive makes it easier for intermediaries to operate anywhere in the Single Market, thus increasing the choice of insurance products available to customers and helping to ensure they can trust any associated advice. It is a matter for the Commission to propose new legislation. Further proposals in relation to insurance may potentially be brought <Col N="193"/>forward during the course of the Presidency, or shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>Achieving a fully functioning Single Market in the insurance area is a key dimension of the Government's insurance reform programme, so as to increase the range of competitively priced insurance products available to Irish consumers.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has recently concluded a settlement with Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, a Cayman Islands based bank, for &euro;7.5 million. The settlement involved was reached after detailed <Col N="195"/>exchanges on the various tax issues arising followed by lengthy negotiations between Revenue and the bank and its advisors.</P>
        <P>The grounds of the Revenue claim were that the company had an established place of business in the State and carried on business in the State through a branch or agency from the early 1970s and that the bank's liabilities included tax on profits of the Irish branch and on certain yearly interest payments. The bank held an opposing view on this and contended that it did not carry on a business in Ireland through a branch or agency and that it did not have Irish tax liabilities. The settlement was reached following detailed discussions with the bank on the various tax issues and against a background of unique circumstances and potentially lengthy and protracted litigation. The amount of the settlement, &euro;7.5 million, is a composite amount in full and final settlement of the bank's liabilities.</P>
        <P>The settlement with Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited brings the tax collected, so far from the investigation into the Ansbacher and related accounts to more than &euro;38 million. The investigation is continuing and Revenue have successfully obtained five High Court orders against financial institutions and third parties for books, records and other documentation which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders.

	<P>The existing EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, known as PEACE II, is a unique EU funded programme for all of Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland, that is the six counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.</P>
        <P>PEACE II aims to help Northern Ireland become a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland. The programme <Col N="196"/>runs from 2000 to 2004 and will provide around &euro;707 million for projects of which &euro;141 million will be spent in the Border region. The EU contribution is &euro;531 million. The programme represents a continuation of PEACE I that covered the period 1995 to 1999 to which the EU contributed &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>To be inclusive, the PEACE II programme funds a wide range of projects across Northern Ireland and the Border region, including ex-prisoner groups, from both traditions. The total sum committed by the programme to ex-prisoner groups, from republican and loyalist traditions, amounts to &euro;11.9 million. This represents around 1.9% of the total value of awards by the programme to all projects.</P>
        <P>The PEACE II programme offers potential projects financial support as long as they meet strict funding criteria and can demonstrate that the moneys will go toward activities that promote peace and reconciliation. All projects go through the same application process and procedure and are subject to the same funding criteria. The programme also operates stringent and transparent monitoring and financial controls and all projects are subject to regular checks to ensure that the aims of the project, as set out in the application, are being fulfilled.</P>
        <P>With regard to the allegation that some of the projects are run by figures associated with Sinn F&eacute;in, within the terms and conditions of funding there is a clause that clearly states that no PEACE II moneys may be used for political purposes and activities.</P>

        <P>Notes:</P>
        <P LI="1">Years ending in &ldquo;1&rdquo; have been selected as they coincide with years in which a census was taken up to 1991.</P>
        <P LI="1">The old age dependency ratio is the ratio of the number of persons aged over 65 years to those aged 15-64.</P>
        <P LI="1">The projections for 2011 onwards are based on the M1F2 scenario. The M1 migration assumption envisages net inward migration declining from 15,000 per annum during the 2001 to 2006 period to 5,000 per annum during the 2011 to 2051 period. The F2 assumption envisages the total fertility rate declining to 1.75 by 2011 and remaining constant thereafter.</P>
        <P LI="1">The projections use the 1996 census results as the baseline. The 2002 based projections are due for publication in mid-year. Use of the 1996 baseline instead of that for 2002 is not likely to have any major impact on the magnitude of the projected old age dependency ratio.</P>

	<P>I met Chancellor Schroder in Government Buildings on Monday, 9 February. We had a useful and constructive exchange of views on the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
        <P>We agreed on the importance for Europe of the new constitution and we are united in wanting <Col N="208"/>to see the IGC concluded as soon as possible. We had a wide-ranging discussion on the IGC including on the principle of a dual majority voting system to which Germany is very strongly committed. A priority for us is to try to establish whether it is possible to find agreement on how that principle can be implemented in a way which takes account of the concerns of everyone. I thanked the Chancellor for the assurance of Germany's continued support for our approach.</P>
        <P>We also had time to touch on a number of other issues including the forthcoming spring <Col N="209"/>European Council and future financial perspectives. On the spring European Council, I briefed the Chancellor on our approach which will be to have a focused strategic discussion on how best to achieve the economic and social goals we have set ourselves.</P>

	<P>The Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in certain equipment and products which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was examined on a number of occasions by the Council working party on trade questions in Brussels during 2003. On the basis of this work, and in the light of positions taken by member states, it was decided that the Commission should present a revised proposal.</P>
        <P>At this time, the revised Commission proposal is still awaited by the Council. After receipt of the revised proposal, which is expected in March or April, the Irish Presidency will seek to ensure that the proposal is adopted as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>During the past seven years, my Department has entered into a very significant number of contracts and procurements in order to fulfil its administrative functions.</P>
        <P>Ensuring that any list of contracts and procurements entered into by the Department since 1997 is comprehensive and exhaustive. Establishing whether or not overruns occurred, and the nature of such overruns, will require a very significant amount of staff time and resources and cannot be provided within the current timescale. I have instructed officials of my Department to compile the details for the Deputy, and have them forwarded to him as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department awards contracts and procurements based on the most economically advantageous tender and strives to ensure that all contracts or procurements offered provide the greatest value for money possible. Officers of my Department closely monitor these contracts for their full duration.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>Indirect expenditure by my Department's agencies on contracts and procurements are day-to-day matters for those agencies and, as such, I have no function in the matter.</P>

	<P>Arising from recommendations from the Comptroller and <Col N="212"/>Auditor General's office, my Department records details of all consultancy type projects since 2000 on an interdepartmental consultancy database. The attached schedule sets out details of all such consultancies in respect of the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 as transcribed from the database. It also includes similar details in respect of the year 1999.</P>
        <P>A feature of my Department's procedures for approving funding for consultancies under the consultancy subhead, subhead A07, is that before any funding is approved by the management board, the section requesting such funding must make a strong business case, outlining the anticipated benefits, the value-added nature of the consultancy, and the argument for engaging outside consultants in preference to undertaking the work using the internal resources of the Department.</P><Col N="211"/>

	<P>The area of late payment in commercial transactions comes within the area of responsibility of my Department. The European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (SI 388 of 2002) came into operation on 7 August 2002. Under the regulations, sections 4 to 11 of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 were repealed. It is the regulations, rather than the Prompt Payment Act, which now govern payment practices in both the public and private sectors. This legislation provides an entitlement to interest in the event of payment for a commercial transaction being late. The entitlement to interest is a matter for the supplier to follow up or to enforce.</P>
        <P>In December 2002 my Department wrote to all Departments asking them to advise public bodies under their aegis that they should continue to report their payment practices as they had under the 1997 Act. County councils must publish an annual report and, accordingly, details of their payment practice should be published in the annual report. I do not have details of instances where any county council may have been pursued for late payment interest.</P>

From 1 May 2003, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is responsible for practically all of the financial services industry, including the registration and supervision of insurance undertakings and the services provided by them. I do not have the information that the Deputy is requesting in relation to the company to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>The levy that the Deputy refers to is a tax, stamp duty, and is levied on non-life insurance policies at the rate of 2% on an insurer's gross premium income in respect of risks located in Ireland. The proceeds of the levy go to the Exchequer and any review of this levy is therefore a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent inflation figures from the consumer price index show an inflation rate of 1.8% in January 2004. This is significantly lower than the 5.1% rate of increase recorded in February 2003. The reduction in the rate of inflation, is encouraging and is in keeping with the objective set in the partnership programme, Sustaining Progress. The goal of Sustaining Progress is to create a virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate wage growth and higher productivity, thereby providing a firm competitive business environment for Irish industry.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that Ireland remains competitive as a guarantee to future economic success and to correctly position ourselves to take advantage of improvements in the global economy. The annual competitiveness report, 2003, produced by the National Competitiveness Council, while confirming many of Ireland's strengths, highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices we have to make in the present uncertain global economic environment. Strengthening competitiveness requires a number of actions and both the Government and I are fully committed to taking the appropriate measures as I have stated on previous occasions.</P>
        <P>The Government is continuing to take steps to strengthen competitiveness across the economy and to implement specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas for Irish industry. One such area is insurance. As the Deputy will be aware I am in the process of implementing a programme to fundamentally reform the insurance market to tackle the issue of high premiums, which have had a detrimental effect both on consumers and on business competitiveness. I am committed to continuing with the reform programme and bringing about improvements in the functioning of the insurance market. A key aspect of this is the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003. The PIAB is expected to be up and running in the near future. It will reduce the litigation costs associated with delivering compensation.</P>
        <P>I have stated on several occasions that the principal and most sustainable method for reducing costs and maintaining them at an acceptable level is to increase competition in all sectors of the economy. We cannot afford to have sheltered sectors of the Irish economy immune from price competition. Competition in all sectors must be encouraged to ensure goods and services are provided at an efficient and affordable price. The powers and resources of the Competition Authority have been increased substantially to enable them to effectively tackle cartels and <Col N="236"/>abuses of dominant position and to recommend regulatory reforms to improve competition in key markets.</P>

These include low skilled clerical, administrative and general operative jobs where workers should be readily available in Ireland and the wider EEA, in sectors such as retail, transport, hotel and catering, construction etc and for child minding in domestic circumstances. Full details are available from my Departments website and from F&Aacute;S. This restriction does not apply to the renewal of existing work permits.</P>
        <P>Where an employee wishes to change employers, a new permit can be applied for, but not to fill a job on the ineligible list. This should not prevent a worker applying for jobs that are eligible, including jobs in the meat and mushroom industries, farming and forestry sectors to mention just a few. The list of ineligible categories is kept under constant review by my Department in consultation with F&Aacute;S and was last updated in December 2003.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 211 together.</P>
        <P>On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and <Col N="240"/>restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</P>
        <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve with the Army.</P>
        <P>I must emphasise I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</P>
        <P>Planning is ongoing by the military authorities but no final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals.</P>

	<P>On 1 July 2003, the Government agreed that Gormanston Camp, County Meath, would be among the State lands released under the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.</P>
        <P>The intention is that this initiative will be targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market. The release of State lands under this Initiative is a critical first step in <Col N="241"/>ensuring early delivery of affordable housing units.</P>
        <P>The modalities regarding the transfer of Gormanston Camp are under active consideration in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the development of the affordable housing initiative.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 150 on 16 December 2003 wherein I outlined the position in relation to restrictions on the use of land in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the Department's safety policy regarding Casement Aerodrome in 1999 a revised policy statement, based on the recommendations of the consultants who conducted the review and having regard to the security requirements for this military establishment, was forwarded to South Dublin County Council for incorporation into their development plan.</P>
        <P>The security zone and the approach areas (four), which conform to International Civil Aviation Organisation criteria, form part of the safety policy. The various restrictions on development in the vicinity of the aerodrome are, accordingly, reflected in the current plan.</P>
        <P>Section 7(1)(<i>e</i>) of the Local Government Act 1991, requires a local authority, in performing its functions, to have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government and any Minister of the Government in so far as they may affect or relate to its functions. The present arrangement which was designed to ensure the safety of military air traffic en route to and from Casement Aerodrome has operated satisfactorily down the years and, accordingly, it has not been necessary to introduce a protected area order as provided for at section 36 of the Defence Act 1954 .</P>

This document contains all the relevant information pertaining to an individual's military service, including testimonials. It is not possible for a duplicate LA89 to be issued.

        <P>Military personnel, who held a military driving permit (AF154), may at time of discharge apply for a certificate of competency to enable them to apply for a civilian driving licence. This certificate of competency is valid for five years. The individual in question was discharged from the Defence Forces in 1987, so any such certificate would by now be invalid in any event.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The person named submitted two applications under the 2003 special beef premium scheme. The first application was received on 28 May 2003 in respect of 12 male animals. Advance payment of 80% of &euro;1440 for these animals issued on 29 January 2004.</P>
        <P>A second application was received on 15 September 2003 in respect of 17 male animals. Following computer validation of this application, one of these animals showed as a female, while a further five were shown as sold within the retention period. Therefore, the advance payment of &euro;1320, which issued on 29 January 2004, was in respect of 11 animals. Following correspondence with the person named and review within my Department, the position with regard to the five animals sold within retention has been resolved and an advance payment in respect of these animals will issue shortly. As only male animals are eligible for the scheme, no payment is due in respect of the animal identified as female.</P>

        <P>In relation to IT projects, it is the practice when outsourcing bespoke software development to do so on the basis of a fixed price for the specified work. To this extent the cost of the work set out in the request for tender does not vary. However in such tenders the supplier is normally asked to quote a daily rate for additional work or changes that arise during the duration of the contract. The option of having additional work carried out at these rates is included the contract. Any such additional work or changes to existing work is controlled under and must be approved by the Department before being carried out by the supplier.</P>
        <P>With bespoke software development, no matter how well business functionality is specified, it is likely that some new functionality requirements will arise during development. The extent to which this will arise depends both on the duration and scale of the development. Where the supplier through no fault of the Department requires more effort to complete a task, the additional effort is normally at their own loss.</P>
        <P>An exception to this was the NASA project, my Department's new accounting system. It became clear that the software delivered did not meet the Department's requirements especially in relation to Government cash accounting. My Department had to renegotiate the contract to have a suitable solution delivered.</P>
        <P>Because of the extended implementation timescale, there were increased costs for external management consulting. The total external costs of the project came to &euro;6.4 million excluding VAT. The total overrun on the original contract together with consequential costs in additional contracts for management consultancy comes to &euro;3.3 million excluding VAT.</P>
        <P>Major IT projects carry inherent risks that some specified functionality may not be deliverable by the solution providers. In order to minimise these risks the Department has revised its policy on such projects and current policy includes: minimising the customisation of packaged software solutions; and segmenting of major projects into smaller phases, each of which is signed off and delivered before proceeding with further phases.</P>
        <P>On 1 August 2000 the Punchestown event and exhibition centre was provided with funding which would not exceed &euro;13.3 million. This was increased by &euro;1.5 million on 3 October 2001 to meet local authority planning requirements regarding sewage treatment and additional car <Col N="244"/>parking. In the end a total of &euro;14.6 million was paid for the project.</P>

More recently, the EU has offered duty-free and quota-free access to all imports except arms from the least developed countries. Also, in the context of the current WTO round of trade negotiations, the EU has offered generous arrangements under the heading of special and differential treatment for developing countries.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to an outbreak of ring rot on a farm in Wales, which occurred in November 2003.</P>
      <P>Ring rot is a bacterial disease that only affects potatoes. It is not airborne and does not survive in soil without a host crop, but it can survive for some time on machinery, handling equipment <Col N="246"/>and stores. Ring rot is primarily introduced by the planting of infected seed potatoes.</P>
      <P>Under Council Directive 93/85/EEC all member states are obliged to carry out annual surveys for ring rot. The directive also lays down detailed measures, which must be observed in relation to the detection, prevention, spread and eradication of the pathogen. Last year my Department took 600 samples under the survey across the whole potato sector involving the national crop of seed and ware and imports from the EU and third countries. The sampling regime is based on risk analysis and to date all samples have proved negative for ring rot.</P>
      <P>A single infection of ring rot on one farm in Wales in November 2003 was confirmed. This triggered a review of our measures, which have proven adequate to date. I will continue to monitor the situation in the United Kingdom closely in consultation with the authorities there.</P>
      <P>In addition, testing for ring rot is being reviewed in the context of the risks involved and all commercial growers, with the co-operation of the IFA, have been asked to identify their seed source to supplement existing information for risk assessment for the disease. Some re-orientation of existing controls, with an increase in inspection levels, follow-up sampling and testing has also been undertaken.</P>
      <P>Growers and traders have been advised as to what precautions should be taken to reduce the risks of an outbreak and spread of the disease. Such measures include good rotation and hygiene and the purchasing of seed, from reliable sources. Traders should ensure that there is proper labelling and documentation and deal only in quality potato products, at all times.</P>

        <P>Trade with ACP countries is governed by the terms of the ACP-EU partnership which was signed in Cotonou in June 2000 under which the EU grants non-reciprocal trade preferences to imports from ACP countries. In September 2002, the ACP countries and the EU officially launched negotiations on a series of economic partnership agreements which will replace the existing arrangements with reciprocal agreements that are WTO compatible and which will retain an element of differential treatment for the ACP countries. The economic partnership agreements will cover trade in agricultural products. The current preferential trade regime has been extended pending completion of the negotiations.</P>

	<P>The reform of the Common Agriculture Policy as agreed last year in Luxembourg has resulted in a continuation of the move from product support to producer support. The key for Ireland, due to my decision to go for full decoupling at the earliest date, is that the single farm payment will no longer be linked to the production of individual agricultural commodities. This complies with the criteria for the green box as set down by the World Trade Organisation.</P>
        <P>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development uses the term &ldquo;non or minimally trade distorting&rdquo; for the range of policies which do not have any significant impact upon production and I believe that this term applies to the decoupled payment regime now being established for Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The recent reform of the CAP will be of benefit to developing countries as decoupled payments will replace production related supports, thereby reducing their impact and potential to distort trade and markets.</P>

        <Quest>when the final report by consultants (details supplied) on flood alleviation works to be initiated along the Tolka River will be published; the meeting he has had with representatives from these consultants with regard to the final publication of their report on works to alleviate the flooding of the River Tolka in the Meath and Fingal County Council areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The final report of the River Tolka flooding study was published by Dublin City Council, which is the contracting authority for the greater Dublin drainage study of which the study of the River Tolka forms part, in December 2003 and details the measures required to protect homeowners against flooding along the river. The report was commissioned in association with Meath and Fingal County Councils, and the Office of Public Works, which funded the report. The final report is available for viewing in Meath County Council's area office and library in Dunshaughlin and has also been published on the Council's website. It is also available for viewing in Fingal County Council's offices in Swords and will soon be published on its website. Dublin City Council has also published the report on its website and it is also available at its offices in Wood Quay as well as Drumcondra library.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, OPW has been undertaking flood alleviation works since mid 2003 on behalf of Meath County Council in the Dunboyne and Clonee areas on foot of the interim report produced by the consultants in late 2002. These works comprise the interim and phase 1 works as described in the final report and will be completed later this year. I am satisfied that these works, when completed, will give long-term protection from flooding in the Dunboyne and Clonee areas from the Castle Stream and River Tolka.</P>
        <P>Fingal County Council has now approved a package of works it its area, and detailed design <Col N="252"/>is currently being prepared. OPW and the council have reached agreement on the implementation of the proposed works and it is hoped that the works will commence in the next few weeks.</P>

        <Quest>the number of contracts or procurements funded directly or indirectly by his Department during the past seven years in respect of which cost overruns have occurred; the full extent of such overruns; the cause or causes of same; the action taken to prevent a reoccurrence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Contracts in my Department are generally of limited cost and of an advisory nature and significant cost overruns are therefore not a frequent feature. My Department has identified two contracts in which overruns occurred. A contract with the IPA for a review of the internal audit function in the Department saw an increase of &euro;5,445 on an original contract price of &euro;3,630. The cost increase arose because it became clear, after the commencement of the project, that more <Col N="253"/>in-depth interviews were necessary to complete a satisfactory review.</P>
        <P>In the NDP/CSF information unit, which operates under the aegis of my Department, a contract with Drury Communications Limited for public awareness research saw an overrun of &euro;2,767 on a contract of &euro;48,567 because the survey questionnaire finally agreed was significantly longer than originally estimated.</P>
        <P>Prevention of a recurrence in the sort of cases mentioned above would require more comprehensive specification of the projects prior to commencement and this will be done as far as possible. Presumably the Deputy's main interest is in relation to capital projects. In view of this and although the OPW is not funded directly or indirectly by my Department, that office will communicate any relevant information in relation to its contracts or procurements during the past seven years direct to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>My Department had spending on reports, consultancies and other advisory or PR commissions as mentioned by the Deputy in each of the five years 1999 to 2003. In addition, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland (ECBI), which was within my Department's remit, also incurred such expenditure in the years 1999 to 2002. The NDP/CSF unit, which operates under the aegis of my Department, also had such spending, but a breakdown of that spending is only available by project.</P>
        <P>The total in respect of each year for the Department and the ECBI, and the total for the NDP/CSF unit for the years in question, are shown in the following summary table:</P><Col N="253"/>

	<P>The Commission's communication on its proposals for the future financing of the EU, post-2006, published on 10 February last, will require close examination by all new member states, including Ireland. The same will apply to the third cohesion report, expected shortly, which sets out in more detail the Commission's views on how cohesion policy should evolve after 2006.</P>
        <P>Deputies can recall that the negotiations on Agenda 2000, the equivalent process that established the EU budget framework for the period 2000 to 2006, took some two years to negotiate. We can expect a similarly lengthy negotiation on the communication now being <Col N="270"/>made by the Commission for the post-2006 period.</P>
        <P>The Government, of course, is very conscious of its responsibilities as Presidency of the EU in ensuring an effective and even-handed conduct of the negotiations. The main priority for the Irish Presidency is to initiate a process, or road-map, for the future negotiation, rather than to enter into detailed negotiation at this early point.</P>
        <P>The Government's overall approach in the negotiations will be to seek to ensure that the final agreement is in the best interests both of the EU and of Ireland. In this regard, we will be fully committed to achieving a balanced overall outcome that takes full account of all aspects. EU cohesion policy is targeted at the poorest member states and regions of the EU. Given Ireland's very substantial economic progress in recent years, it is to be expected that the level of transfers to Ireland after 2006 will be significantly reduced compared to what we received under Agenda 2000. The Government will, of course, seek the best possible arrangements for Ireland's regions within the framework of the EU's overall cohesion policy. The Government is conscious in particular of the ongoing development needs of the Border, midland and western region, especially in the area of infrastructure. The Deputy can rest assured that the Government will keep the regions' needs to the forefront in the negotiations.</P>
        <P>The Government is also conscious of the development needs of the new member states and will show solidarity with them by supporting substantial assistance from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds to them.</P>

        <P>The precise terms of reference of the group are: to examine and develop proposals for measures in the areas of taxation, PRSI and levies, for the budget and the Finance Bill within agreed Government parameters for the overall Budget position and in the context of the framework of a medium term and longer term strategy set out in the Government's programme; to examine the strategic approach for a general social welfare package; and to assess the interaction of income tax/PRSI/levies proposals with social welfare proposals including child income support, and in particular the impact of this interaction on the labour market and income distribution.</P>
        <P>Under its terms of reference, the group will be examining, over the course of the coming year, a range of issues, with a particular focus on budget 2005 and the subsequent Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>Many of the past policy papers and minutes of the meetings of the group can be found on the Department's website, <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i> It is intended that further documents relating to the budget and the Finance Bill 2004 will be made available in April 2004.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are approximately 2,500 small self-administered pension schemes in existence but it is not possible to separately identify those established since 1997.</P>
        <P>Employer contributions to small self-administered pension schemes are treated as a trading expense. Employee contributions are netted off as deductions from an individual's income before arriving at the definition of income for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Figures of pension contributions by employers and employees are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling estimates of cost to the Exchequer, the highest amount of relief or the average amount of relief allowed. Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioner's records.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax deduction card is not transferred between employers when an employee moves from one employer to another employer.</P>
        <P>Where an employee changes employment, the procedure is as follows: the former employer is obliged to complete a form P45 (Income Tax &mdash; Pay As You Earn &mdash; Cessation Certificate). Part 1 of the form P45 is submitted to the appropriate income tax district dealing with that employer. Parts 2 and 3 of the form P45 are delivered to the former employee. Once parts 2 and 3 of the form P45 are given by the employee to the new employer, that employer may apply the tax credits and standard rate cut-off point shown on it for the purposes of calculating the PAYE arising in the new employment. The new employer then sends form P45 (part 3) to the appropriate income tax district. A tax deduction card or a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut off point is issued by the appropriate income tax district in the name of the new employer.</P>
        <P>In the absence of the form P45 parts 2 and 3, the new employer is obliged to apply the emergency tax rates until such time as the employee produces a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut off point in the new employer's name or a tax deduction card is issued to the new employer by the appropriate income tax district. The new employer refunds any income tax overpaid when the tax deduction card or tax credit certificate is received.</P><Col N="273"/>
        <P>There is no statutory time limit in relation to the issue of a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut off point/a tax deduction card for the new employer.</P>

	<P>I understand that the UK Office of Fair Trading intends reviewing how public sector procurement is affecting competition. The review will focus on access for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to the public procurement market. My Department has no plans to conduct a similar review at present.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for the national public procurement website, <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>, which is the national public procurement opportunities website. It is the key reference point for suppliers and service providers, including SMEs, wishing to do business with the public sector. As the number of registered suppliers continues to increase I would expect SMEs to gain more access to public sector procurement opportunities, going forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the severe flooding in Ennis in 1995 Clare County Council along with Ennis Town Council (then UDC) decided to undertake the Ennis main drainage and flooding study. The Office of Public Works funded the costs of the River Fergus flooding aspects of the study and a preliminary report was completed in 2001. The report is currently being considered by OPW for advancement under its programme of flood relief projects.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in November 2002, I initiated a major review of the State's approach to flooding with the primary objective of developing a cohesive national flooding policy in the future. That report is currently being considered by Government Departments before being submitted to the Government in the very near future. The recommendations of the review group will have an important influence on the whole flood management area in the future, and I am confident that the recommendations will, in the long term, substantially mitigate the impact of flooding on Irish society.</P>
        <P>There are heavy demands on OPW at present for the funding of flood relief projects and the timescale for progression of any flood relief scheme in Ennis is, therefore, dependant on the <Col N="274"/>necessary capital funding being available over the next few years and consideration of issues arising from the policy review. I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, to ensure that a scheme is progressed as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it appears from their records that the taxpayer has never been registered as a self-employed individual. On submission of a completed return of income form together with details of the taxpayer's previous tax history a nil net liability letter will, if appropriate, issue to the taxpayer provided the income is below the exemption limit.</P>
        <P>This letter can then be furnished to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and any self-employment voluntary PRSI contribution paid. A form 11 return of income together with a covering letter issued to the taxpayer on Friday, 13 February 2004.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that the taxpayer's income tax affairs are dealt with in the Kildare, Meath, Wicklow customer services district of the Revenue Commissioners, Grattan House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, telephone number 01- 6474000, extensions 44744, 44745, 44854, 44855.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an investigation is currently being conducted into the circumstances surrounding the application, issue and use of GATT licences under Commission Regulation (EC) No. 954/2002 by 16 Irish companies who had used these licences to import beef from South America into Netherlands and Italy at a reduced rate of import duty. In all, 29 Irish companies had been approved to avail of quota under this Regulation <Col N="275"/>during the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.</P>
        <P>This investigation was initiated following a request received from the European Commission's anti-fraud agency, OLAF, at a meeting on 4 February 2003 when certain matters were brought to the attention of the Commissioners. While it is too early to say when the investigation is likely to be concluded, I am informed that it is currently being actively pursued and will be brought to conclusion at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works has received of the order of 700 proposed property solutions in respect of the decentralisation programme. These proposals include offers of sites or existing buildings or proposals to build. The assessment of these proposals is now underway. The main criteria by which they will be evaluated were set out in the advertisement, seeking property solutions, which was placed by the OPW in the newspapers at the end of last year. They are as follows:</P>
        <P>1. the proposed cost of the accommodation offered either by way of lease, outright purchase or on a deferred purchase basis; 2. the proposed time scale within which the accommodation can be provided; 3. the quality of the design and <Col N="276"/>specification; 4. the potential for future expansion exhibited by any proposed site or building; 5. the proximity of the site/building to amenities and any available transportation node; 6. the practicality of any car parking proposal submitted in relation to the site/building; and 7. premises should comply where appropriate with all relevant sections of the Health and Safety Acts, the building regulations and the Planning Acts and should be fully accessible to persons with disabilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a married couple who have elected to be jointly assessed for income tax and who are caring for their grandchildren. In that case, the couple would be entitled to receive the married person's credit of &euro;3,040 per annum and, if each spouse is working in the PAYE sector, each would be entitled to receive the employee credit of &euro;1,040 per annum. If one of the spouses is aged 65 or over, they may receive the married age credit of &euro;410 per annum. These entitlements are not affected by the fact that the couple are caring for their grandchildren.</P>
        <P>The home carer's tax credit of &euro;770 per annum may be obtained in respect of a child whom the <Col N="277"/>claimant or the claimant's spouse is in receipt of child benefit, provided the annual income of the second spouse does not exceed &euro;5,080. If the annual income of the home carer exceeds that amount, the tax credit is reduced by half the excess (effectively &euro;1 of tax credit is subtracted for every &euro;2 by which the income exceeds &euro;5,080) so that where the annual income exceeds &euro;6,620 no tax credit is due.</P>
        <P>If the couple pay medical insurance premiums in respect of themselves and/or in respect of their grandchildren, they would be entitled to receive tax relief at the standard rate at source in respect of such premiums.</P>
        <P>In addition, the couple are entitled to tax relief at their marginal rate of tax in respect of unreimbursed medical expenses which they incur in respect of themselves and/or their grandchildren. In such circumstances, a <i>de minimis</i> amount would be applied and the couple would be obliged to bear the cost of the first &euro;250 of unreimbursed expenses in a tax year in respect of themselves and their grandchildren. Further details of this relief may be found in the detailed guide entitled &ldquo;Health/Medical Expenses Relief&rdquo; which is available on the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie</i></P>
        <P>An incapacitated child credit of &euro;500 per annum may be claimed in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education. The couple may avail of this credit in respect of one or both of their grandchildren if one or both are incapacitated.</P>
        <P>An employment of a carer allowance may be claimed where a person, or a spouse or a relative is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity for a tax year and a person is employed to care for the incapacitated person. The allowance applies at an individual's marginal rate of tax for expenses up to &euro;30,000 per annum. Where the cost of employing a carer is shared by family members, the allowance can be shared between them subject to the overall ceiling in any one year. Therefore, the cost of employing a carer can be shared by the incapacitated person and their relatives.</P>
        <P>There are various other discretionary reliefs which may be available to the taxpayers themselves, such as Schedule E expenses, rent relief, mortgage interest relief, relief for service charges, relief for contribution to approved superannuation schemes, but, the fact that the couple are caring for their grandchildren has no impact of the availability of these reliefs.</P>

        <P>Securing the competitiveness which has been so instrumental to our economic development, and thereby safeguarding jobs, is a key priority for this Government.

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 to 257, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Taxation is only one contributing factor in our economic competitiveness. Other factors include, for example, economic and technological infrastructure, education and skills levels, the level of entrepreneurship and enterprise, and our ability to be innovative and creative. At the same time, levels of direct and indirect taxation impact directly on our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Since first coming to office in 1997, the Government's taxation policy has been to keep down the levels of personal and business taxation in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy. The strategy is outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government and is underpinned generally by the provisions of the Sustaining Progress agreement.</P>
       <P>To this end we have lowered our corporation tax rates to a level where the most recent report of the Competitiveness Council, the Competitiveness Challenge 2003, published in November 2003 indicated that, in a selection of 16 comparator countries, Ireland has the most competitive rate of corporate taxation. It is also interesting to note that the same report indicated that among the same 16 countries, Ireland has the second lightest burden of regulation on international firms, second only to Finland.</P>
        <P>In addition, since 1997 progress has been made in reducing marginal and average personal income tax rates. Both the standard and top rates <Col N="281"/>of personal taxation have been reduced by 6 percentage points each since 1997. They stand currently at 20% and 42%, respectively. The standard rate bands have also been widened considerably. As a result, average tax rates have been reduced at all income levels. The most recent data available from the OECD in its publication <i>Taxing Wages</i> relating to the year 2002, indicates that, for a single person on the average production wage, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU; the EU average tax wedge is 40.5% while the figure for Ireland is 24%. Overall, therefore, we have made significant progress over the last seven years or so in improving the impact of taxation on competitiveness.</P>
        <P>There is a need to keep our tax provisions under review from a competitiveness perspective. Budget 2004 provided for a 20% tax credit against corporation tax which will be available to companies for qualifying research and development expenditure above a certain baseline. This new credit will assist the enterprise sector to make a decisive transition from high-volume, lower-value activity to high-value, knowledge-intensive activity. It will also complement the various direct research and development grant supports which are also available through various agencies of the State.</P>
        <P>In budget 2004, I also announced proposals to encourage companies to locate their regional headquarter and holding companies in Ireland. The Finance Bill 2004 provides for an exemption from tax on gains on the disposal of a shareholding in a subsidiary, whether Irish or foreign, and makes a number of related changes to the scope of our provisions for relief against foreign tax in respect of dividend income paid to parent companies. This measure will help to ensure that Ireland remains competitive and that we can maintain and attract high quality investment projects to Ireland leading to additional future employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>In relation to taxation and its impact on the price of goods and services, this impact is also considered as part of the annual budgetary decisions on VAT and excises.</P>
        <P>Going forward, the Government are committed to ensuring that our taxation policy remains consistent with the key priority of maintaining competitiveness so as to sustain economic growth and maintain high levels of employment.</P>

	<P>In this year's budget the goal of keeping inflation low took precedence and I made only limited changes to indirect taxes and excises. The effect of the indirect tax and excise changes will add less than <Col N="282"/>0.4% to the consumer price index. These changes will bring in &euro;243 million in additional revenue which is needed to fund public services.</P>
        <P>Our rate of inflation moderated significantly over the course of 2003 and continues to do so. Inflation in January this year fell to 1.8%, its lowest level since October 1999. HICP inflation, the standardised measure for the EU, fell to 2.3% in January, its smallest differential with the euro area average since the beginning of monetary union.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.</P>
        <P>Section 13 of the Finance Act 2002 provides that the transfer and appropriation of securities other than ordinary shares to the beneficiaries of an ESOT or APSS in the circumstances of certain takeovers may take place in a manner which preserves the tax benefits to the participants. The point at which income tax is foregone is when the shares are passed into the ESOT, which in the case of Eircom took place in 1999 and not arising from any amendments contained in section 13.</P>
        <P>In June 2001, the tax advisers to the ESOT contacted officials in the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to discuss the tax implications for the Eircom ESOT of the proposed takeover of Eircom. Having considered the issues involved, I indicated in June 2001 that I was prepared to propose an amendment and this I duly did in the Finance Act 2002. This was made known in my response to a D&aacute;il question from the then Deputy and now Senator Derek McDowell on 14 November 2001 on this subject.</P>
        <P>Had the change not been made, the ESOT would have had to distribute cash to the beneficiaries as the ESOT would not have been permitted to acquire the preference shares, giving rise to a clawback of some of the income tax foregone in 1999. However, this revenue would only have arisen if the takeover had proceeded.</P>
        <P>The legislative changes simply provided the membership of the Eircom ESOT with a level playing field to choose to support whichever bid they wished to support.</P>
        <P>In the event, two takeovers were in a position to take immediate advantage of these legislative changes. The first was the takeover of the land-line business of Eircom by the Valentia consortium and the second was the takeover of ACC Bank by Rabobank.</P>
        <P>I have made numerous changes to the ESOT legislation to facilitate ESOT's in changing circumstances to ensure that they retain the benefits available to them. This is because, by their nature, ESOTs are tailor-made to each particular circumstance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks, two proposals aimed at helping to regularise the situation of undocumented foreign nationals in the United States have been put forward.</P>
        <P>On 7 January, President Bush announced a proposal to introduce a new form of temporary work permit which would be available to both undocumented foreign nationals currently in the US and those seeking to enter with a job already arranged. Shortly afterwards, Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Chuck Hagel announced a bipartisan plan for immigration reform that would enable undocumented foreign nationals in the US to legalise their status if they fulfilled certain conditions.</P>
        <P>I welcome both of these proposals as constructive efforts to deal with the situation of the undocumented in the US in a constructive and sympathetic way. While there appears to be no prospect of a formal amnesty for the undocumented at the present time, the Daschle-Hagel proposal in particular appears to offer undocumented Irish people an opportunity to obtain permanent legal residency.</P>
        <P>I will monitor the progress of these proposals through the US Congress closely. Through our embassy in Washington and through my own contacts with political leaders in the US, I will continue to encourage and support measures that would benefit undocumented Irish citizens in the US.</P>

        <Quest>if, in the context of the programme of the Irish EU Presidency, he will support efforts towards the adoption of an international arms trade treaty by 2006 to prevent the export of arms when they contribute to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and to promote support of fellow EU member states for this goal; if the Irish Presidency will instigate a review of the functioning of the EU code of conduct on arms transfers and take steps towards improving its effectiveness.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While work on the drafting of the text of the proposed international arms trade treaty is still ongoing, it is a promising initiative and I commend the non-governmental organisations concerned for their efforts. An official of my Department participated in a conference held last November at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine the text of the proposed treaty. I understand that the text is being re-examined from a legal perspective by those NGOs involved in the arms control campaign who are meeting this month in Costa Rica and that as a consequence of those discussions revisions to the text may be made. We await the outcome of that meeting. Ireland will continue to be associated with the process and will closely monitor developments.</P>
        <P>The proposed treaty is under discussion within the EU. Discussions have taken place at working group level, most recently last month, and will continue during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. All exports of arms from EU countries must conform to this politically binding code which establishes criteria to control such exports. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods, including respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the <Col N="318"/>preservation of regional peace, security and stability. A review of the code is already ongoing in the Union. This review includes the possible reinforcement of the status of the code of conduct, for example, by its transformation into an EU Common Position, which would be legally binding. Ireland is supportive of such a reinforcement of the code.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, on 18 December 2002, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the draft optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, OP-CAT. The EU has called upon all member states to sign and ratify the optional protocol. The object of the protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>
        <P>There are 21 signatory states to the optional protocol. The following EU member states are signatories to it: Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Two states have ratified or acceded to the optional protocol. These are Albania and Malta.</P>
        <P>As regards Ireland's national position in relation to the optional protocol, the question of signature with a view to subsequent ratification is under consideration. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is reviewing national legislation to ascertain whether legislative changes would be required before signature and ratification of the optional protocol.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>During the course of the security alert which took place between 2 and 9 February in the area of Stewartstown, County Tyrone, my Department was contacted by local political representatives conveying their community's concerns about the rationale for the security operation and the manner in which it was carried out. In addition to the sustained disruption to the area, they drew our attention to the damage which was being done to property of local farmers and fishermen, allegedly by the action of British troops.</P>
        <P>I immediately directed my officials to raise these concerns as a matter of urgency with the British authorities, through the offices of the British-Irish intergovernmental secretariat in Belfast. As of yet, we have not received a formal response from the British side. My officials continue to press for this. On foot of this formal response, a decision will be made on what follow-up action may be required.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is focused on our responsibilities as Presidency of the Council of the European Union and many of our staff have been re-deployed to temporary Presidency posts for this period. When the Presidency is over, I propose to assign staff to the new unit.</P>
        <P>I have not yet reached a firm conclusion on the number or level of staff required for the unit. I envisage that they will be drawn from personnel currently serving in the Department and will have the skills necessary to advance the implementation of the report of the task force, in partnership with the relevant Government Departments and voluntary agencies.</P>

        <Quest>the reason Ireland supplied aid to Uganda given the evidence available in respect of Government activities and the serious concern expressed in respect of human rights in Uganda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Uganda, as the Deputy will know, is one of the least developed countries in the world and has suffered grievously in its history under dictators like Idi Amin and Milton Obote. Ireland has a programme of development assistance in Uganda five other countries in sub-saharan Africa and one country in Asia with the single-minded purpose of tackling deep poverty and supporting economic and social development. The partnership implicit in that engagement does not blind the Irish programme either to the weakness of governance which is common in poor, developing countries or make it tolerant of human rights abuses.</P>
        <P>In Uganda, there has been significant progress in development. Poverty has been reduced, the infection rate for HIV-AIDS has been reversed, the economy has grown from its low base, universal primary education has been introduced with close to full national enrolment and, in general, the quality of public service has been improved. However, Uganda has also been engaged militarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its heavy-handed campaign against the heinous Lords Resistance Army in northern Uganda has exacerbated the plight of innocent civilians.</P>
        <P>In the case of the first, Ireland, in concert with its donor partners, has used the leverage of its development programme to pressurise the Government of Uganda for withdrawal from the DRC and for engagement with the peace process. There has been much progress on this issue. In April last all Ugandan troops left the DRC and, since then, Uganda has been playing a full role in the peace process. Ireland still presses for the holding to account of Ugandans who have been involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC resources and in human rights abuses. Some action has been taken and a number of senior Ugandans have lost office. More remains to be done, however.</P>
        <P>The situation in northern Uganda is difficult and complex. Over a year ago, the Ugandan defence forces, with the agreement of the Government of Sudan, moved across the Ugandan-Sudanese border in a bid to crush the Lords Resistance Army. The LRA is an insurgent group with a strange fundamentalist religious agenda and a history of gross human rights abuses, including mass child kidnapping, and which for almost two decades had been attacking villages in northern Uganda. A year later the situation has worsened. The LRA has moved back into northern Uganda, has increased its attacks, has driven over a million people from their homes and has created a food crisis in the region.</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>Ireland, again with other donors, has adopted a two-track approach to the situation. To help deal with the humanitarian crisis, NGOs like Tr&oacute;caire and Concern and agencies like the World Food Programme have been given funds to enable them assist people affected in the north. On the wider issue, Ireland has pressed the Ugandan Government to reconsider its policy in the north, in particular to continue to allow for an amnesty for LRA fighters who wish to surrender, to pursue the option of a negotiated settlement and to address the alienation in the region which has allowed the LRA to operate.</P>
        <P>In summary, while engaging in Uganda with the primary purpose of assisting some of the poorest people in the world, Ireland has pursued a critical and clear-minded policy of encouraging responsible and responsive government. We believe that dialogue and engagement are the best means to promote and secure progress in both sustainable development and democratisation.</P>

	<P>In November 2003 I announced an increase of &euro;10 in the standard leaving certificate fee (&euro;76 to &euro;86). This represented an increase of 13%, and similar increases were then applied to other examination fees. The new amounts were formally notified to schools in December 2003 by the State Examinations Commission. Any information given by schools to parents prior to this was not based on a formal notification from the State Examinations Commission. It is regrettable that this may cause parents and schools some inconvenience.</P>
        <P>Examination entry fees are in existence to defray in part the costs of running the certificate examinations. Examination entry fees cover only part of the costs involved. Candidates who hold a current medical card or are dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card are not liable for examination fees. Medical cards will be accepted only if valid on 1 February 2004, the due date for payment.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of a full-time and part-time resource teacher together with a shared learning support teacher. My Department has received applications for further special educational resources, SER, from this school and the position in this regard is as follows.</P>
        <P>Resources in respect of an emergency application for one of the persons referred to by the Deputy have been approved on a temporary basis; SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the applications for the remaining 13 persons made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of existing resource levels, the details of which were submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

        <P>Under the Equal Status Act 2000, educational establishments may not discriminate as regards <Col N="326"/>the terms and conditions of admission on the basis that an applicant is of a different race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin. However, I understand that educational establishments may exercise differential treatment as between EU and non-EU nationals in relation to fees for admission and the allocation of places.

        <P>The main conditions of the free fees initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates; and hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Candidates must hold EU nationality; have official refugee status; have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State; have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State; be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU member state who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed or self-employed, in the State; or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; be nationals of a member country of the european economic area.</P>

        <P>As I announced when publishing the programme, a key strategy for school building projects going forward will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. This strategy will provide better clarity for schools in terms of when they can expect their projects to proceed.</P>
        <P>As the first step in the review process, my Department is currently holding consultations with the education partners in relation to the prioritisation criteria used for large scale building projects. The purpose of these consultations is to ensure that the criteria has optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post primary sectors.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 321 together.</P>
        <P>I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. The report of the working group was recently submitted to me. Issues dealt with in the report include the content and format of the examination modules, the standard of the examinations and the period of provisional recognition granted to applicants within which they are expected to pass the SCG. The report is currently under consideration and decisions in relation to the recommendations contained in it will be taken in due course.</P>
        <P>The review group has drafted an interim syllabus. The redrafted syllabus was circulated to all schools in December 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus.</P>
        <P>The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>
        <P>Courses of study aimed specifically at candidates for the SCG examination are run by a number of Education Centres throughout the country. The level at which courses are provided is dependent on the demand. Copies of past examination papers, including tapes of the aural examinations, are available on request from primary administration section 1 of my Department in Athlone as is a copy of the interim syllabus for the SCG examinations, which was circulated to all schools in December, 2002 and which included a reading list of prose and poetry to be studied for the examinations.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the rules for national schools, the length of the school day for pupils enrolled in infants or first class may, at the board of management's discretion, be reduced by one hour to four hours and 40 minutes.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that particular circumstances may arise whereby the implementation of the shorter day for these pupils can cause difficulties for some parents. Where this arises, my Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution. However, in the event that pupils enrolled in an infants or first class cannot be collected until the end of the school day for the more senior pupils, the school authorities would be obliged to ensure that the pupils concerned are appropriately supervised during the period in question.</P>

        <Quest>the primary schools in <Col N="331"/>County Louth that are served by the national educational psychological service; if there are unfilled vacancies for NEPS psychologists in County Louth; and the waiting list in Louth for psychological assessments for schools that are served by NEPS and non NEPS schools.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the 73 primary schools in County Louth, 37 currently have a service from the national educational psychological service, NEPS. All the schools that do not yet have a service (36) may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA. Details of this scheme have been circulated to all schools and are also available on my Department's website.</P>
        <P>Under the Draft Development Plan for NEPS, which was presented to my predecessor in April 2000, it was envisaged that the final total of NEPS psychologists in the north-east region, of which County Louth forms part, would be 17. At present, 11 of these are in post, with one on maternity leave and one on a career break. Four of the psychologists are currently in post work in the Louth area. It is hoped to make another appointment to the region before the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>Expansion to some further schools will be possible on the return of a psychologist from career break later in the year. Expansion of the service to all schools must await further recruitment.</P>
        <P>NEPS psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools, and visits each on a regular basis. The school authorities provide names of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days. Where cases are less urgent, the psychologist will, as a preliminary measure, act as a consultant to teachers and parents, offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress.</P>
        <P>Schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service commission psychological assessments directly from a panel of psychologists under the terms of the SCPA. My Department does not therefore have information as to the normal waiting time for assessment under this scheme.</P>

Progressing the European Commission's White Paper, A New Impetus for European Youth, is a priority for the youth agenda during the Irish Presidency. I plan to hold a youth conference at ministerial level in County Clare from 4 to 6 March next and, while its overall theme reflects the youth Presidency priority of progressing the White Paper, it will focus particularly on two issues. These are young people and politics &mdash; a key dimension of youth participation &mdash; and the development of youth policy at EU level. Approximately 170 delegates, including young people, are expected to attend this conference from both member states and acceding countries.</P>
        <P>At the January meeting of the European Union's youth working party, the Irish Presidency introduced a draft resolution on social inclusion with specific regard to young people, which will highlight the issues involved for these young people in many different areas of activity and concern.

	<P>The proposed large-scale building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme, which is published on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i> This proposed project is at stage 3, detailed plans-costs, of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The proposed project will be authorised to progress to advanced architectural planning during 2004. Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004.</P>
        <P>The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which, in turn, will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year. In addition to the proposed large-scale building project, five temporary classrooms have recently been provided at the school.</P>

	<P>As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate conducted a sample <Col N="337"/>survey in late 2002 of 25 primary schools that had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</P>
        <Miles par="113" com="cl"/><P>While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, the report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over-identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</P>
        <P>Arising from the findings in the report, all applications for special educational resources are subject to individual verification. In addition, my Department is reviewing the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In this context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. It would be premature to anticipate the outcome. I can confirm, however, that the basic purpose of the review is to ensure each school has the resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Pending the conclusion of discussions with the representative interests, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. The board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools to discharge its responsibilities. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate and educational services together with a further eight head office staff. To date, 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed. This includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service. The board has recently advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies, which will bring the total staff complement to 84.</P>
        <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. A total of 13 towns with significant schoolgoing populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education.</P>
        <P>The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. My Department has recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. An information leaflet and an application form are being prepared for issue to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.</P>
        <P>Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences and a protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board.</P>

	<P>I am not aware if the institution referred to by the Deputy has been investigated for the abuse of children. The Oireachtas, through the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, established a statutory body with the powers of the High Court to undertake such investigations. The Act specifically provides that the commission shall inquire into abuse allegations and shall determine the extent to which certain bodies contributed to abuse. If allegations of abuse in respect of this institution were made to the investigation committee of the commission, it would be a matter for that forum to carry out the kind of inquiry to which the Deputy refers. The institution was not a certified industrial or reformatory school and my Department did not have a regulatory or inspection role in respect of it.</P>
        <P>The institution is included in the Schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and therefore former residents of the institution may make an application for redress to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The board was established for the purpose of making financial awards to assist in the recovery of certain persons who as children were resident in certain institutions and who have or have had injuries that are consistent with abuse received while so resident.</P>

	<P>The school building programme for 2004 as published is focused towards the construction of large-scale new building projects which were in the advanced stages of architectural planning. The proposed extension project at Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s is in the early stages of architectural planning and, consequently, did not feature in the 2004 programme.</P>
        <P>However, given the difficulties being experienced at the school, my Department is anxious to provide a speedy solution to meet the short to medium-term needs of the school. In this regard, it is prepared to provide permanent high quality modular accommodation in accordance with a schedule of accommodation to be agreed with the school authority. Such accommodation is widely used in other countries and has been used here in the prison service. In addition, my Department satisfactorily piloted an entire new second level school in Cabra last year using this accommodation. The main advantage of modular accommodation is the speed with which it can be delivered. It is also permanent and can be demounted for use elsewhere as circumstances at individual schools change.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged the remainder of the accommodation required at Meanscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s can be provided using the same delivery method under next year's capital programme. However, if the school authority wishes to follow the traditional building delivery method, its project will be included in a re-evaluation of all projects that will not go to construction as part of the 2004 programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. This re-evaluation will take place following completion of a review of the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects which is taking place with the education partners.</P>

        <P>Special needs assistants may be approved to assist a pupil who has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support are outlined in circular 07/02 which issued to primary schools in February 2002. The criteria remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>Since October 1998 the number of special needs assistants has increased from approximately 300 to the current number of 4,319 full time and 1,353 part time posts. In autumn 2002, as part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate conducted a review of special educational resources in 25 primary schools. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</P>
        <P>While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, the report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over-identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to review the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In this context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. It would be premature to anticipate the outcome. I can confirm, however, that the basic purpose of that review is to ensure each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>I am anxious to ensure the support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources which are being made available in the special education area have the desired effect of ensuring all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require.</P>

	<P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. The publication and sale of school books are in the hands of independent commercial enterprises and it is not open to me to compel publishing companies to produce texts in a particular format. However, my Department will convey the Deputy's suggestion to the Irish Educational Publishers' Association.</P>
        <P>Following the report of a working group set up to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags in 1998, the report and information leaflets and posters were sent to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
        <P>Positive action has been taken by many schools. Actions taken by a number of schools at second level consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P>

	<P>I take it that by realignment the Deputy is referring to the amalgamation of two or more primary schools. In this regard the commission on school accommodation published two reports in September 2001, namely, the Amalgamation of First Level Schools and Amalgamation of Second Level Schools. These reports present a framework of key issues and recommend detailed models for the amalgamation process together with other recommendations on dealing with amalgamations in the future. The recommendations in the report are incorporated in the best practice in dealing with amalgamation within the Department. Copies of the relevant first or second level report are also made available for guidance to school communities embarking on an amalgamation process. A number of recommendations in the reports require further consultation with the education partners and consideration of the resource implications of their implementation and this will be undertaken in due course.</P>

It is a matter for a school authority to confirm the veracity of information presented to it for the purpose of a proposed appointment and my Department, in so far as it can, provides assistance to schools in meeting their obligations in this regard. In the case of the recent appointment of a principal by the board of management of Patrician High School, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, it has been confirmed to the board that duly certified documents in the records of my Department show that the appointee has in excess of the requisite number of years, five, of wholetime teaching service required of a candidate for appointment as a principal.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy has the services of two shared full-time resource teachers, together with a shared learning support teacher. I can confirm also that my Department has received an application for special educational resources, SER, in respect of the child referred to by the Deputy. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to <Col N="349"/>cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after 31 August 2003, including the one referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support.

	<P>The Department's involvement in matters concerning the health effects of non-ionising radiation, which includes radio frequency emissions from mobile telephone base stations, is guided by advice from national and international health authorities. The advice is based on findings of peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature, and on <Col N="352"/>deliberations at scientific meetings of established expert groups such as the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. The Commission for Communications Regulation is undertaking a survey of 400 communication sites. The first 100 results have been published, all of which are well below the limits outlined by the international commission. These results also include the installation at Dangan, County Tipperary.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The Government recognises the importance of a balanced regional roll-out of broadband and is taking a series of initiatives to support and complement investment by the private companies operating in the market.</P>
        <P>An indicative &euro;200 million has been set aside for the current programme of broadband infrastructure developments under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This programme includes funding for the metropolitan area <Col N="354"/>networks in 19 towns and cities across the country and the extension of digital subscriber lines by both Eircom and Esat BT. This includes the provision of DSL in Killarney. Funding assistance was also given for the construction of the ESB's national fibre trunk network and other regional broadband investment initiatives.</P>
        <P>Under the new broadband action plan, which I announced recently, a multi-annual budget of &euro;140 million has been committed to the provision of broadband connectivity in more than 90 towns and smaller rural communities in partnership with the local authorities and in co-operation with the telecommunications industry. Operational details for the broadband action plan are being finalised and I expect to make a full announcement shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department now has a dedicated website on which the level of availability of broadband in any area may be easily checked. The website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, provides details of broadband availability in all areas of the country. A check of the website shows that the following broadband services are available in the Killarney area: digital subscriber lines are available from Eircom and Esat BT; fixed wireless broadband is available from Amocom; satellite broadband is available from Digiweb Satellite and Media Sat. Full details of the prices for the various services and contact numbers for the companies are available on the website.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Port of Waterford Company is statutorily responsible, under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000, for the control, operation, management and development of its harbour. The company provides it core facilities for ships and goods at Belview, County Kilkenny. In accordance with its statutory remit, the company has been conducting a review of its non-core assets to determine the appropriateness of their retention in present circumstances. Given that the north quays is one of the company's principal non-core assets, I am informed that the company is taking the preparatory steps necessary to offer the property for sale. Investigations are ongoing regarding the provision of alternative facilities within the <Col N="355"/>harbour for the large trawlers that have used the north wharf and Frank Cassin wharf as a refuge in bad weather. While initial negotiations were facilitated by a senior official from my Department, this is a matter for the port company and the fishermen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Since its establishment in June 2002, my Department has operated a number of programmes through which financial assistance is provided to organisations towards the development of arts and sporting infrastructure throughout the country. Tourism development projects are supported directly or indirectly through the budgets of the tourism State agencies or through EU financing sources and I have no information regarding cost overruns in such cases.</P>
        <P>Under the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes, grants are awarded to voluntary and community organisations and to local authorities to assist them in the provision of their sporting and leisure facilities. The funding provided by the Department complements the local funding provided by these organisations, which have responsibility for the overall funding and completion of the projects. More than 3,500 projects have been supported under these programmes over the past seven years. Taking into account the nature of the funding provided <Col N="356"/>by the Department and the conditions attached to such funding, the Department has no information regarding contracts placed by these organisations where overruns may have occurred.</P>
        <P>Grants are also awarded towards the cost of arts capital infrastructure. Projects are grant-aided to a maximum of 85% of total project cost. It is the responsibility of the project promoters to ensure the finance is in place to cover increases in overall costs and the Department accepts no liability for such increases. However, notwithstanding the absence of liability, two projects, in respect of which construction and refurbishment work proved more costly than anticipated, were granted additional funds during the period 1998-2001. The additional funds granted by the Department in these cases amounted to &euro;1.27 million.</P>
        <P>In the most recent arts capital grant scheme, ACCESS 2001-2004, financial consultants were contracted by the Department to carry out financial assessments of all applications submitted and it is expected this action will help to prevent cost overruns on grant-aided projects.</P>

	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme administered by my Department allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>The 2004 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 30 November and 1 December 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 16 January 2004. A total of 1,302 applications were received before the closing date. A schedule of the application numbers from each county under the programme for the Deputy's information follows. These applications are being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant <Col N="360"/>allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services to medical card holders. The formal position is that arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody services, are a matter for the individual health boards, having regard to their priorities within the funding allocated. Accordingly, chiropody services provided by health boards vary throughout the country but, usually, priority is given to medical card holders who are aged 65 years and over; persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin Anti-D, or from the receipt within Ireland of a blood product or a blood transfusion and who have Health Amendment Act 1996 cards; and for persons with illnesses such as diabetes or arthritis. Persons must be referred for chiropody services by their general practitioner or public health nurse.</P>
        <P>My Department has been made aware of the practice by a number chiropodists, particularly <Col N="362"/>those in parts of the Eastern Regional Health Authority's area, of levying their medical card patients for services. The chairman of the chief executive officers group was asked last November to investigate the matter and revert to my Department in an effort to ascertain the level of this practice nationally. A reminder was sent to the group in December. Contact was made with the group again this week. The report is still being compiled and it should be available later this week.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of a similar question in November, a letter was also sent to the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking that the matter should be investigated and pointing out that, since these extra charges were inappropriate, they should not be levied on eligible persons. The letter asked that the matter be investigated as a matter of urgency and a reply issued to the Deputy concerned as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department is undertaking an assessment of chiropodists for eligibility to practice in the public health service. This assessment should be completed by the end of May and should result in an increase in the number of chiropodists available to provide services to medical card holders. Contractual arrangements for the provision of chiropody services are a matter between the chiropodists concerned and the local health board.</P>

        <Quest>if he will consider extending the long-term illness card cover to include Wegners disease, which is debilitating and responds well to medication, making it particularly appropriate for inclusion in long-term medication cover.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people suffering from the following conditions and who are not medical card holders for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Wegners disease is not included in the list of conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>
        <P>A range of other schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a <Col N="363"/>medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. The CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances in determining eligibility. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of services for people with Alzheimer's disease is based on the Action Plan for Dementia, published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1999. Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report and, in each of the years since 1999, my Department has provided additional funding to psychiatry of old age &mdash; more than &euro;5 million &mdash; and to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for services delivered &mdash; more than &euro;2 million. In addition, carers of Alzheimer's sufferers have benefited from the &euro;5 million the Department has made available, in the same period, specifically for the support of carers. Health boards are making progress in the provision of stand alone dementia units.</P>
        <P>However, I accept there is need to continue with the provision of respite services in order to provide relief to carers, the development of day hospitals and day-care facilities, the provision of support to carers, including training programmes, and the development of the old age psychiatry programme to its full potential. It will be my policy to prioritise these issues as resources permit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of my Department regarding the care of older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence in their own home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. This policy was first enunciated in the care of the aged report, published in 1968, and confirmed in the report, The Years Ahead: A Policy for the Elderly, published in 1988. Numerous research studies have shown that the vast majority of older people has a preference to remain living in their own home for as long as possible rather than moving into long-stay residential care.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have encouraged the authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight <Col N="365"/>nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long-stay residential care.</P>
        <P>The report, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review, sets out the need to develop additional capacity in the acute hospital system and the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, to develop an additional 3,000 beds in the acute hospital system by 2011. There is also a commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital places for older people encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposes the provision of an extra 5,600 extended care-community nursing unit places over seven years, which will include provision for people with dementia.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, public private partnerships are being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new community nursing units will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment-rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence. If the PPP pilots demonstrate success, it is the intention to use PPP as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the acute hospital bed capacity initiative, my Department has provided an additional &euro;8.8 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and &euro;3.8 million to the Southern Health Board to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting, thereby, freeing up acute hospital beds. My Department has been informed by the authority that in excess of 200 patients in the acute hospital system in the eastern region have been moved to more appropriate accommodation in the private nursing home sector under this initiative.</P>

	<P>My Department collates and publishes data on public hospital waiting lists on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists on 30 September 2003, the latest date for which figures are available, was 27,212. This figure includes both in-patient waiting lists and day case waiting lists and represents an annual decrease of approximately 7% on the figure for the quarter ending 30 September 2002.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been achieved in reducing waiting times for adults and children. The number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialities has fallen by approximately 42% from 6,273 to 3,658 between September 2002 and September 2003. The number of children waiting more than 6 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialities has decreased by 39%, from 1,201 to 734 in the same period.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is continuing to target those adults and children waiting longest for treatment. It is now <Col N="368"/>the case that, in most instances, adults waiting more than 6 months for an operation and children waiting more than three months will now be facilitated by the fund.</P>

        <Quest>the surplus in regard to the Western Health Board in 2002 and 2003; the areas to which this surplus reissued; and the projects to which it was reallocated.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The outturn of the Western Health Board for 2002 was &euro;672.234 million, giving a surplus of &euro;11.594 million. The provisional outturn of the board for 2003 is &euro;748.093 million, giving a surplus of &euro;4.825 million. This gives a cumulative surplus of &euro;16.419 million. This is provisional as the final figures for 2003 will not be available until the annual financial statements have been prepared and submitted for audit by 1 April next.</P>
        <P>The 1996 accountability legislation requires boards to transfer either a deficit or surplus for the preceding year to the following year. Accordingly, the Western Health Board has included such surplus funding in its service plan-budget for 2004, which has already been passed by its board.</P>
        <P>Following from meetings with health boards on 2004 service plans, Department officials met with some health boards to discuss issues arising and requiring follow-up. On those boards which recorded surpluses at the end of 2003, discussions covered the background to the financial outcome and the intended use of such once-off funding in 2004. Following these meetings it is clear that there was a combination of factors giving rise to the positive out-turns including: protecting specific service funding where this could not be invested due to timing issues. It is intended that this funding will be fully utilised in 2004 for the services specified; contingency funding balance not fully required in 2003, but now available in 2004; minor capital funding provided in late 2003 which had the effect of freeing up revenue funding previously committed.</P>
        <P>In general, the planned service volumes in line with the 2003 service plan was delivered, indeed in the acute hospital sector delivery targets were exceeded. The planning of spending in the Department of Health and Children in any year is a complex issue, in the context of the increasing demand for services and the unpredictable nature <Col N="370"/>of the pressures which can arise over the year. In line with Government policy all health agencies had been strongly advised by my Department to manage their resources on a prudent basis and to explicitly provide a contingency sum for unplanned pressures. While there are surpluses reported for a number of boards, the outturn for the health system overall reflects a positive variance of less that 1% of total spending.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the consultants' common <Col N="376"/>contract, each consultant is entitled to engage in private practice within the hospital or hospitals in which he or she is employed. The extent to which a consultant is entitled to engage in private practice outside the hospital or hospitals in which he or she is employed is determined by the category of post which he or she holds. It is also subject to the consultant satisfying the employing authority that he or she is fulfilling his or her contractual commitment to the public hospitals.</P>
        <P>Consultants who have a category two contract are entitled to engage in private practice off-site from the public hospital. Where a consultant is engaged in private practice within institutions where the managing authority is separate from the public hospital and-or the hospital is financed from private funds, then that private practice is considered as off-site.</P>
        <P>While the particular arrangements that apply in individual circumstances are, in the first instance, a matter for the employing authority concerned, I would expect that administrative support for private practice would not be provided by the public sector, unless there were appropriate recoupment arrangements in place.</P>

	<P>Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam commits the European Community to implement binding measures to lay down high standards of quality and safety on the use of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives. Directive 2002/98/EC, which was adopted on 27 January 2003, set standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.

        <P>A directive of the European Parliament and Council on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and cells will be adopted in the coming months and again this will be transposed into national law in due course. Article 13 of the directive will require that the procurement of human tissues or cells shall be authorised only after all mandatory consent or authorisation requirements in force in the member state have been met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The price of medicines in Ireland has been controlled since 1972 through multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI. Under these agreements, the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new medicine covered by the agreement may not, on the notification date, exceed the UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is lower. A price freeze is in place for existing products covered by the agreement. The current agreement has been extended to mid-2005.</P>
        <P>Under the general medical services scheme, the State reimburses pharmacists the trade price of the drug plus a dispensing fee. For the drugs payment and long term illness schemes, the State reimburses the trade price of the medicine, the retail mark-up, normally 50% of the trade price, and a standard dispensing fee. My department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 and 401 together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the provision of hospital services in the eastern region is, in the first instance, a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to reply directly to the Deputy on the specific information requested on patient and contract bed numbers.</P>
        <P>The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, was established specifically for the purpose of arranging treatment for those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. The fund has been successful in locating additional capacity and arranging treatments for approximately 11,000 patients. It is now the case that, in most instances, adults waiting more than six months for an operation and children waiting <Col N="380"/>more than three months will now be facilitated by the fund.</P>
        <P>The pressures on acute services, particularly in the eastern region, have been and continue to be the focus of my attention. Officials from my Department have been actively engaging with senior management in the various health agencies in looking for short-term and longer term solutions to these difficulties.</P>
        <P>In addition to increasing the acute bed capacity of hospitals in the eastern region as part of the national initiative on acute hospital bed capacity, I have provided an additional &euro;12.6 million, &euro;8.8 million to the ERHA and &euro;3.8 million to the Southern Health Board, to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting thereby freeing up acute beds. This funding has resulted in the discharge of over 200 patients from acute hospitals in the eastern region. The ERHA is continuing to monitor the situation and working with hospitals and the area health boards to ensure that every effort is being made to minimise the number of delayed discharges in acute hospitals.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the number of patients in each health board area attending accident and emergency departments of hospitals as a result of assault in each of the years from 2001 to date; and the number of in-patient hospitalisations in each acute hospital due to homicide and injury purposely inflicted by other persons for each of the years 2001 to date.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4991/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Data on attendances at accident and emergency departments are collected each month nationally but it is not possible to determine what proportion of attendances at accident and emergency departments are due to assault.</P>
        <P>Information on hospital in-patient activity is collected in the hospital in-patient inquiry, HIPE, system. This system records the number of hospital discharges in publicly funded acute hospitals and is not a patient-based system. Table 1 which follows presents data on the number of hospitalisations due to homicide and injury purposely inflicted by other persons by hospital in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Where fewer than ten cases were recorded in a hospital on average over the three years, this data has been aggregated into the &ldquo;other hospital&rdquo; category. Interpretation of this data should be approached with caution since reporting of external cause is not required so may not be complete.</P>
        <P>Data for 2003 is not yet complete. In addition, the level of completeness may vary from hospital to hospital. No estimate on the final number of cases for 2003 can be inferred and therefore valid comparisons between hospitals and over time cannot be made based on this partial data.</P><Col N="381"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards-authority in the first instance.</P>
        <P>The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics &mdash; both nationally and in the South Eastern Health Board, SEHB, in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines.</P>
        <P>The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The number of cases treated in the SEHB is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients.</P>
        <P>However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage of specialists and so, <Col N="384"/>increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service.</P>
        <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded thirteen dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These thirteen trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists, including four from the SEHB, in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork dental school. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on the 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork dental school my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. My Department has no role in regulating the price of private orthodontic treatment charged by private practitioners; the price is largely a function of forces in the private market; however, tax relief is available in respect of orthodontic treatment costs obtained privately.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officer of the SEHB has informed my Department that at the end of the December quarter 2003, there were 2,249 children receiving orthodontic treatment from the health board. This means that there are almost three and a half times as many children getting orthodontic treatment from the board as there are children waiting to be treated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had inquiries made of the South Western Area Health Board, SWAHB, and understand that a decision was made in January 2004 to return medical care processing services to one central location, Poplar House, headquarters of community care Kildare-west Wicklow. I understand from the SWAHB that the decision was taken due to difficulties experienced over the past few years in regard to the operation of the scheme at local level and the need to provide consistent high quality service to the public.</P>
        <P>The SWAHB has assured me that the centralisation of this service will achieve a high quality service provision in Kildare-west Wicklow with all clients files available in one central location, prompt processing and output of applications as well as easy access for appeal cases. I understand clients can still get medical card application forms and return medical card application forms to the local health centre. They can also access advice, etc. on medical card application through the local health centre there. The only difference will be, the processing of the medical card application will be done in Poplar House.</P>

The board has advised that the Sacred Heart Hospital, Roscommon, currently provides care for 182 patients in four units. A number of rostering shifts prevail throughout the hospital. The staffing levels in each unit, between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. is as follows: 5 p.m. &mdash; 5.30 p.m., three staff nurses and three attendants; 5.30 p.m. &mdash; 6 p.m., one staff nurse and three attendants; and 6 p.m. &mdash; 8 p.m., one staff nurse and two attendants.</P>
        <P>The board has further advised that it has been experiencing huge difficulties in recruiting nursing staff for the hospital and it is currently seeking applications having recently placed an advertisement for staff nurses.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Pending the drafting and enactment of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and as a transitional measure, an interim chairman of the commission for taxi regulation was appointed in February 2003 to undertake a series of consultations with those involved in the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and other relevant groups. The interim chairman's remit was to explore their views on the future operation of services, with a particular focus on qualitative issues, including standards for vehicles, drivers and entry into the industry. This process was completed in September 2003.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 in July 2003 which provides for the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation, a recruitment competition for the post of commissioner for taxi regulation was held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. However, the commission was unable to recommend a candidate for appointment. A further recruitment competition on the basis of an enhanced salary for the position is under way, with the post being advertised in the national newspapers last week.</P>
        <P>I have, however, made an order under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 to provide for the establishment of an advisory council to the commission for taxi regulation with effect from 4 November 2003. The primary function of the council is to advise the commission and me as <Col N="400"/>Minister, as appropriate, in relation to issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. Pending the establishment of the commission, I have indicated that I am particularly interested in the advice of the council on issues relating to quality enhancement and standards for small public service vehicles and their drivers, including general vehicle condition and appearance, accessibility for persons with mobility and sensory difficulties, a standard vehicle colour for taxis and the introduction of enhanced training, including customer service training and disability awareness, and knowledge requirements for existing and new small public service vehicle drivers.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the date on which he received the report of the taxi hardship panel; and the reason for the delay in issuing payments in respect of the recommendations of this panel which have been accepted by Government.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4570/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the taxi hardship panel was received by my office in late September 2002. On 17 December 2002, the Government approved the publication of the report and the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel by the national taxi regulator.</P>
        <P>To progress the taxi hardship panel recommendations in advance of the formal establishment of a proposed commission for taxi regulation, it was subsequently decided not to give the hardship payments function to the commission for taxi regulation. Instead, Area Development Management Limited, ADM, was engaged to administer and manage the taxi <Col N="401"/>hardship payments scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. An application form was prepared in consultation with ADM, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the Revenue Commissioners, and was also modified following consultations between my Department and taxi representative groups.</P>
        <P>The taxi hardship payments scheme was formally launched in November 2003 with application forms being issued to all persons who made submissions to the taxi hardship panel. In addition, newspaper advertisements were placed in the national newspapers on 6 November 2003 inviting applications under the scheme from individual taxi licence holders at 21 November 2000. ADM is proceeding with the processing and assessment of applications under the scheme as the application forms and associated required documentation are returned to them. Payments to qualifying persons under the scheme commenced in December 2003. The time taken to process applications and to make payments depends on the completeness of the information and supporting documentation in each individual application.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Acts provide the basis for the application of a range of controls and restrictions on pedal cyclists. Many of the controls, certain of which also apply to other traffic, are provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998.</P>
        <P>Requirements in relation to the lighting of vehicles generally are set out in the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963. These regulations provide that pedal cycles must be fitted with front and rear lights which must be operated during lighting up hours. These regulations also require cycles to be equipped with a rear reflector so as to be plainly visible at night-time by the headlamps of a motor vehicle directly behind. The promotion of road safety awareness generally is a matter for the National Safety Council. The council has produced a range of material that is aimed directly at the promotion of the safe use of roads by pedal cyclists.</P>

	<P>Statutory obligations for pedestrians to exercise <Col N="402"/>care and take all reasonable precaution in order to avoid causing danger or inconvenience to traffic and other pedestrians are set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997. These obligations include &mdash; a specific requirement that pedestrians should not cross a roadway within 15 metres of a pedestrian crossing facility. The National Safety Council has responsibility for the promotion of road safety awareness generally. One of the major campaigns that the council is promoting concentrates on pedestrian safety.</P>

	<P>The production of an NCT certificate when taxing a motor car has not been a requirement since 12 December 2001 when, arising from an industrial dispute at National Car Testing Service Limited earlier that <Col N="403"/>year which affected testing, some motorists were experiencing difficulties in arranging tests in sufficient time to obtain the NCT certificate needed for their motor tax application. On the resumption of normal testing service, the demand for the NCT indicated that restoration of the NCT/motor tax link was not necessary as NCT compliance rates were on a par with those for motor tax. It is a matter for individual insurance companies whether to require the production of an NCT certificate when insuring a motor car. It is an offence to use in a public place a motor car that is liable to vehicle testing without it having a valid NCT test certificate.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, it is envisaged that the debts associated with Cork and Shannon airports will remain with Dublin Airport and this will enable the new airport authorities for Cork and Shannon to commence with a fresh, debt-free start facilitating the development and growth of their business. In this regard, the issue of Aer Rianta's main subsidiaries, including the Great Southern Hotels group, is being carefully examined.</P>

	<P>For some years now my Department has been funding the pilot rural transport initiative. The RTI is a scheme whereby 34 rural community groups are being financed to operate pilot rural transport services in their areas. Area Development Management Limited administers the initiative on behalf of my Department and the specific allocations for individual RTI projects are made by ADM from funding provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department provided ADM with &euro;2.95 million for the RTI in 2002, &euro;3 million for it in 2003 and the allocation for 2004 is &euro;3 million. This compares with the total of &euro;4.4 million originally earmarked for the RTI in the national development plan.</P>
        <P>The RTI is now operational in almost all counties. Currently it provides some 2,500 transport services on approximately 380 new rural transport routes with some 20,000 people being carried on its services every month. The free travel scheme of the Department of Social and Family Affairs was extended to the RTI in 2003.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Question No. 264 on Wednesday, 11 February 2004. While the Department has no immediate plans to initiate a competition for driver testers, the position is reviewed regularly having regard to current and future requirements of the driver testing service.</P>
        <P>Recruitment to the Civil Service is carried out centrally by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners and interested candidates can register their interest by logging on to the <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i> website. Once registered candidates will be notified automatically when a competition is announced. Any proposed competition will also be advertised in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on a Thursday or in <i>The Irish Times</i> on a Friday.</P>
        <P>Details of qualifications which candidates were required to possess for the last competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission included a good general education; a satisfactory knowledge of the rules of the road, road procedures and the law relating to road traffic in so far as it concerns the driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle; at least five years' satisfactory driving experience within the seven years ending on 25 June 1998; a general understanding of the working of mechanically-propelled vehicles; possess report writing skill with a particular reference to accuracy, clarity and conciseness; a clean driving licence other than a provisional <Col N="409"/>licence valid in the State on the day of the test; possess excellent interpersonal skills, including the ability to communicate clearly both orally and in writing, and the capacity to remain calm and courteous in dealing with applicants; and otherwise possess the requisite knowledge and ability and be suitable to enter on the discharge of the duties of the position.</P>
        <P>A driving instructor must have appropriate insurance cover and hold a full driving licence for the category of vehicle in which he-she is giving driving instruction. Many driving instructors are enrolled with voluntary driving instruction associations or with the voluntary driving instructor register. Proposals being developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. A working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests has formulated the design of the standards that a driving instructor must meet. I am considering what arrangements will be put in place to oversee implementation of the standard in the context of the establishment of a driver testing and standards authority.</P>

	<P>Section 15 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides that a licensee shall not permit a person aged 18 to 20 to be in the bar of licensed premises if that person does not produce <Col N="410"/>an age document to the licensee. &ldquo;Age document&rdquo; is defined in section 15 as including a Garda age card, a passport, an identity card of a member state of the European Communities, a driver licence or a document issued by a body and in a form prescribed in regulations made by the Minister. The obligation to produce an age document to gain admission to the bar of licensed premises is intended to assist licensees to comply with legislative provisions relating to underage consumption of alcohol and to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</P>
        <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase and consume alcohol in licensed premises. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999 set out detailed provisions in relation to the application and authentication procedure as well as procedures for the preparation and issue of age cards. To date, more than 151,000 cards have been issued by the Garda.</P>
        <P>I would encourage licensees to accept the Garda age card as an age document for the purposes of section 15 of the 2003 Act. If a licensee suspects that such a card has been forged or altered, the Garda should be notified as it is an offence to forge a document purporting to be an age card, alter an age card, or use such a document or an altered age card with intent to deceive. In the absence of such a suspicion, I can see no reason a licensee should refuse to accept a Garda age card as an age document.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 378 of 9 December 2003. Business permission is the permission granted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to non-EEA nationals who wish to become established and engage in business in the State in a capacity other than as an employed person, for whom an employer would have to obtain a work permit. The criteria to be met by an applicant for business permission includes a requirement that the applicant must be of good <Col N="411"/>character. In this regard, the applicants themselves are requested to provide a statement of character from the police authorities of each country in which they have resided for more than six months during the previous ten year period. The giving of information to data subjects about themselves is a general principle of data protection legislation.</P>

	<P>The matter raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as such, I have no role in relation to it. However, I have had inquiries made and am informed by the Garda authorities that there was a delay of just over a month from the time the payment was received by cheque on 25 July 2003 to the date the cheque was submitted for clearance. I understand that once the cheque cleared, the Garda authorities transmitted the records onto the Department of the Environment which then, in turn, notified the driver that the penalty points would be notified to his licence for a three year period with effect from four weeks from that date, as required by sections 5 and 7 of the Road Traffic Act 2002.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the penalty points system is operating on a semi-manual basis. This will be rectified later this year when the fixed charge processing system becomes operational. The Deputy will agree that the benefits of the considerable advances in road safety achieved in the period since the introduction of penalty points outweigh the regrettable delays resulting from the operation of the interim manual system.</P>

He was examined in the cell by the prison doctor who pronounced death. In common with all deaths in prison custody, the cause of death is a matter to be determined by a coroner's court. I understand that the Dublin city coroner will inform the family of the deceased of the time and venue of the inquest.</P>
        <P>It is the Irish Prison Service's practice to have a deceased prisoner's family informed of the death in custody as soon as possible. Where possible, this information is relayed face-to-face by the prison chaplain or through a local clergyman who has been contacted by the prison chaplain. However, in cases where there is distance involved, the practice to inform the family of the death as soon as possible necessitates that contact may sometimes be made by telephone. The Irish Prison Service has informed me that, in this instance, the prison <Col N="415"/>chaplaincy service contacted the family by telephone.</P>

	<P>The growth in the volume of business handled by the immigration and <Col N="417"/>citizenship division of my Department has been well canvassed by me in replies to previous parliamentary questions, for example, Questions Nos. 400 and 401 of 10 February 2004, 849 of 27 January 2004, 396 of 18 November 2003, and 1190 of 30 September 2003.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the division is capable of providing an adequate service to its customers. I am conscious of the fact that imaginative solutions are required in relation to the delivery of the resources necessary to improve the service given both the ever-increasing demand and the constraints which exist in the public finances. For that reason I introduced a provision at section 19 of the recently enacted Immigration Act 2004 the effect of which will be to empower the Minister to impose fees for a range of immigration related services. I hope, in so far as is practicable, to charge fees which not alone cover the cost of delivering the service but also cover the cost of necessary future development of the immigration system.</P>
        <P>It is of relevance to point out to the Deputy that, while there are approximately 600 Civil Service staff assigned to immigration related functions in both my Department and its associated independent agencies, more than 70% of those staff are engaged full-time in activities associated with the processing of asylum claims or in the provision of support for asylum seekers. If the 32% year on year reduction in the numbers claiming asylum at the end of 2003 continues, it will in time free up resources which could be deployed in the improvement of mainstream immigration services.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible to quantify every type of application dealt with by the immigration and citizenship division, the average processing time for the main categories are as follows: residency based on marriage to an Irish national &mdash; 12 months; naturalisation &mdash; 15 to 18 months; post nuptial citizenship &mdash; eight months; visa applications &mdash; three weeks; and family reunification applications &mdash; nine months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of refurbishment of Shelton Abbey amounted to &euro;5,473,015. This amount includes professional fees. A substantial proportion of these costs arose from the fact that this is a heritage property whose external fabric had deteriorated badly over the years. Refurbishment work commenced on 13 November 2000 and was completed in mid-2002. The impact of the refurbishment works necessitated a reduction in the occupancy level from 60 to 30 spaces during construction.</P>
        <P>On 11 November 2003, the Government decided to implement, from 1 January 2004, a number of measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association in ongoing talks on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing prison costs. These measures include the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into post-release centres for the re-integration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. The precise arrangements for the running of such facilities are being finalised in my Department.</P>
        <P>As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 583 and 586 on 27 January, 2004, I want the Prison Officers' Association to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the continued operation by the Irish Prison Service of our prisons and the open centres. Discussions are ongoing at the Labour Relations Commission with the POA and I very much hope that a mutually acceptable way forward can be found at that forum.</P>
        <P>However, if a consensus is not achieved, I will have no option but to proceed with the closure of Shelton Abbey as a place of detention and for <Col N="419"/>its conversion into a post-release centre under a different management structure. The Irish Prison Service will arrange for the transfer of prison officers from Shelton Abbey to other prison institutions in this event. There has already been direct consultation by the human resources directorate in the Irish Prison Service headquarters with the individual staff at Shelton Abbey affected by the closure plans.</P>

	<P>It was never the case that all non-national spouses of Irish nationals were required to register on an annual basis. Rather it was the case that the registration renewal was timed to coincide with the renewal of permission to remain in the State. It follows, therefore, that if a person was given a stamp on his or her passport granting five years' permission to remain, then he or she was required to register again only on expiry of that period, unless there had been a change in his or her personal circumstances. Section 9 of the Immigration Act 2004 removes the registration exemption for female spouses.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are empowered under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 to charge for services provided by them. The decision to charge for any service, including the provision of certificates of rateable valuation, and the levels of any such charge are matters for decision by individual local authorities and I have no proposals to introduce legislation to change this.</P>

	<P>I intend to bring draft legislative proposals to Government in the coming weeks to streamline the consent process for major infrastructural projects. While it would be inappropriate in advance of the Government considering these proposals to elaborate on their details, it is intended to reduce the time required for obtaining development consent for necessary major public projects and to co-ordinate and streamline the different procedures now involved, while respecting the requirements of environment and heritage protection and the need for adequate public consultation. In addition, my Department is currently reviewing the planning and development regulations 2001, to ensure that they achieve the aim of streamlining the planning <Col N="426"/>system. I will shortly publish guidelines in relation to rural housing.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 518 of 7 October 2003, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the housing scheme in question (details supplied) is unlikely to be ready by 2 April 2004; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a large number of first-time buyers may have difficulty in meeting the completion and occupation deadline for qualification for the first-time buyer's grant through no fault of their own; if consideration is being given by his Department to the way in which these difficulties might be addressed; his latest proposals to ensure a fair outcome in this regard; and if, in view of these continuing difficulties, he will drop altogether the time limit condition for the payment of the first-time buyer's grant.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In terminating the new house grant, the Government sought to ensure fair treatment by ensuring that people who had already made commitments in the form of signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations or had occupied their houses on or before 14 November 2002 were given an opportunity to apply for the grant. In providing a grace period up to 4 December 2002 for cases such as these, first time buyers who were at the most advanced stage of purchase or building were facilitated as far as possible.</P>
        <P>Regulations setting out the circumstances on which new house grants would be paid after 14 November 2002 came into force on the day of the announcement. However, because of the difficulties that have been faced by some housing <Col N="427"/>grant applicants in meeting the deadline of completing and occupying their new houses, I concluded that the fairest approach was to extend the deadline for completion, occupation and receipt of a request for payment of the grant in my Department from 13 November 2003 to Friday 2 April 2004. In returning their request for payment by the new deadline, applicants will have to produce evidence of occupation. It should be emphasised that this extension applies only to those who submitted valid applications received prior to the application deadline of 4 December 2002. Where all other conditions of the scheme are met, these applicants now have until Friday, 2 April 2004 to complete and occupy their house and return a request for payment to the Department.</P>
        <P>The fact that payment of grant was dependent upon occupation of their new homes by a deadline was one of the stipulations outlined to applicants in correspondence and in media advertisements. The deadline for occupation and return of a request for payment to the Department, now 2 April 2004, was adopted to achieve closure of the scheme, to allow reprioritisation of this budget provision to other social and affordable housing programmes and to prevent speculative applications on houses that might not be built for years to come. The strict application of these deadlines is necessary to preserve the integrity of the scheme. Consequently, no exemptions will be provided for applicants who do not respect this deadline.</P>

The first &ldquo;edited&rdquo; register, which must be published in draft form by 1 November 2004, will contain the names of persons who have indicated that they have no objection to their details being used for purposes other than electoral or other statutory uses. The &ldquo;full&rdquo; register for a D&aacute;il constituency will be made available to each member of the D&aacute;il for that constituency in the normal way; however, it will be an offence to use it for anything other than electoral or other statutory use.</P>

	<P>A major national education and awareness campaign on the use of electronic voting and counting at the forthcoming European and local elections was launched on 4 February 2004. The campaign includes: TV, radio and press advertising; an electronic voting website; the provision of a lo-call information line; a mailshot to every household in the country; and a nationwide roadshow which will allow voters to see and practice on the voting machine. This roadshow will include visits to the Dublin area. The campaign will also seek to raise awareness of the elections and to encourage people to vote.</P>

	<P>As the European and local elections will be held on the same day next June, the local European returning officer will be responsible for holding the polls and the provision of polling stations. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities in making polling schemes, as a reserved function shall endeavour to appoint as polling places only areas which will allow a returning officer to provide at each polling place that at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
        <P>The local European returning officer is required, as far as possible, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users; and where this is not possible, to give public <Col N="431"/>notice of all polling stations in buildings which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to the assigned polling station he or she may apply, in writing, for authorisation to vote at another station in an accessible building in the same constituency. A person with a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station may apply to vote by post.</P>

An independent expert advisory panel assessed the proposals and made recommendations to the Minister in this regard. These recommendations were accepted in full and that is the basis on which the scheme is now <Col N="432"/>being implemented and I have no proposals to extend the LOTS designated area.</P>

        <P>My Department is responsible for the issue of licences under section 23 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 to the Department of Agriculture and Food to capture and humanely kill badgers as part of its continued research into bovine tuberculosis. The numbers of licences issued since 1995 are as follows:

1996, 
329 licences; 
1997,

477 licences; 
2002, 
810 licences; 
2003, 
383<Miles com="jy"/>licences.</P>
	         
        <P>My Department does not have to hand the breakdown of these figures per county, however this information is being compiled and will be<Miles com="jy"/>forwarded to the Deputy as soon as<Miles com="jy"/>possible.</P>
        <P>The most recent survey of the badger population was carried out in 1995. The badger and habitat survey of Ireland was funded by the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of Agriculture and Food. This report estimated that there was a badger population in the order of 200,000 in Ireland. While no county or local breakdown of population numbers was provided, the report gives some statistics on regional variations in the density of badger social groups by county. The lowest densities were in several western and north-western counties and in Wicklow, these counties being generally distinguished by their large areas of upland, bog or moor. The six counties with the highest badger densities were all located in the broad midland zone, Kilkenny, Louth, Limerick, Meath, Offaly and Westmeath, counties with a relatively large proportion of quality grazing land. Three further <Col N="433"/>counties, Carlow, Clare and Cork, had slightly lower densities. The lowest density was recorded in County Longford and the highest in County Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>I am arranging for a copy of The Badger and Habitat Survey of Ireland to be forwarded to the Deputy and for a copy to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

	<P>The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board published its first disbursement plan on 7 November 2003. The plan sets out the board's priorities and provides for the distribution of funds to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons: those affected by economic and social disadvantage; those affected by educational disadvantage; and persons with a disability. A significant level of disbursements from the fund will be ringfenced for programmes and projects within RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and Drugs Task Force areas.</P>
        <P>The board has engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. In this regard, an invitation to organisations, groups etc. to make applications for funding was advertised in the national press on Friday 21 November. I understand that approximately 250 applications have been received to date which ADM are assessing on an on-going basis.</P>
        <P>At its meeting on 19 December 2003, the board approved three projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;175,000. The board will next meet on 17 February 2004 and it is anticipated that a significant number of projects will be submitted to the board for decision at this meeting.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that at its meeting of 16 December, the Government reviewed arrangements in relation to dormant accounts. It decided to give the board key roles in regard to advising, monitoring and planning in the area of <Col N="447"/>dormant accounts, with particular regard to the following: advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding; preparation of the disbursement plan; reviewing, evaluating; and reporting on the effectiveness, additionality and impact of disbursements.</P>
        <P>In the context of the need to ensure appropriate capacity to evaluate and process applications, and so as to secure maximum transparency on disbursements, the Government decided that the objectives of the disbursements scheme would remain unchanged but that it would make decisions on disbursements. Such decisions would be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process, and appropriate arrangements would be put in place so that spending from the Dormant Accounts Fund is clearly separate to Estimates provision.</P>
        <P>Draft legislation is to be brought forward in 2004 with a view to giving effect to these decisions.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under social welfare legislation, the social insurance status of spouses and relatives engaged in a family business can vary with the circumstances. A number of different situations can arise. Spouses or relatives who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self-employed contributors and can make social insurance contributions which may allow them, in due course, to qualify in their own right for social insurance pensions, including old age contributory pension.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, where a family business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business pay contributions as either employees of the company or, if they are proprietary directors of that company, as self-employed persons.</P>
        <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person who is employed directly by his or her spouse is not covered by social insurance. Similar provisions apply in respect of assisting relatives who are excepted from social insurance as employees where: there is no written contract of service or apprenticeship the person in a member of the employer's household; and the employment is in relation to a private dwelling house of a farm in or on which both the person and the employer reside.</P>
        <P>Any person who wishes to seek a formal decision as to whether an employment or self employment is insurable for social insurance purposes should apply to my Department. Where a person is dissatisfied with the relevant decision there is a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>The current arrangements in relation to spouses and assisting relatives has been a part of the social insurance system since it was set out in legislation in the 1950s. Similar provisions were applied in relation to earlier versions of social insurance. The employment relationship is traditionally at the heart of the social insurance system, although it has relatively recently been extended to self-employment for the purposes of some benefits, and the current exceptions for family-type employments recognise the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine employment relationship in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need to consider the specific issue of the social insurance coverage of farm spouses, an interdepartmental group reported in 2002 on the social insurance status of farm spouses. The conclusion of the group, which of course has broader relevance for the issue of family employments generally was that &ldquo;the formation of business partnerships offers an immediate route of access to social insurance cover as it is based on existing legislation. Such <Col N="451"/>arrangements would not impose any significant additional administration costs on farm businesses; for example, couples who are liable for income tax under joint or separate assessment will continue to make one income tax return each year, the only change being that the income of the farm enterprise will be apportioned in accordance with the partnership arrangements&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The position regarding the entitlement of the person concerned to an unemployment payment was fully set out in responses to the Deputy's previous questions. The person concerned has, for some years, been engaged in employment on a part-time basis, five days per week. This has been confirmed once again with his employer. He is also engaged in self-employment, as a tiler. He has an income from this employment and his self employment, however, it has not been possible to quantify his income from this activity, as he failed to provide the necessary information for my Department to do so. The person concerned has suggested that his income from self-employment is 50 per week.</P>
        <P>The issue as regards the entitlement of the person concerned to an unemployment payment is quite clear. He is not and was not unemployed, for the duration of his unemployment assistance claim. The person concerned did not inform my Department of his part-time employment. When his employment came to light, a deciding officer disallowed his unemployment assistance claim from 16 January 2001 to 23 September 2003 on the grounds that he was not unemployed for this period. A letter informing him of the decision and the overpayment which he had incurred, was issued to him on 4 December, 2003.</P>
        <P>As regards an oral appeal hearing, the position as stated in my last reply to the Deputy is that &ldquo;where the appeals officer is of the opinion that the case is of such a nature that it can properly be determined without an oral hearing, the appeal may be determined summarily&rdquo;. This was the position in relation to the appeal submitted by the person concerned.</P>
        <P>On 27 January 2004 the appeals officer made a summary decision to disallow the appeal of the person concerned. The formal determination is as follows:</P>
        <P>&ldquo;I decide that the appellant is disallowed from receipt of unemployment assistance from 16 January 2001 to 23 September 2003, on the grounds that he is not unemployed&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The appeals officer also provided a note on the reason for his decision which is set as follows:</P>
        <P>&ldquo;The appellant has acknowledged that he was employed as a part-time home help from Monday to Friday each week during the period 16 January 2002 to 23 September 2003. In the circumstances the appeal must fall.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision. The only question before the appeals officer in this case was whether the person was &ldquo;not unemployed&rdquo; during the period in question. As it would appear that the central fact, that the person concerned was employed part-time, on <Col N="453"/>five days per week, it is understandable that an oral hearing could not serve any useful purpose. Questions relating to the arrangements for recovery of the overpayment are outside the remit of the appeals officer.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions as regards claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the rent allowance was decreased in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; if her Department will have the case re-examined with a view to increasing the allowance, in view of the original commitment and the hardship of the case.</Quest>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13.</P>
        <P>In addition to the minimum contribution each applicant is required to contribute towards his or her rent any additional assessable means that he or she may have over and above the appropriate rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance. The South Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that the reduction in the amount of rent supplement is due to an increase in the level of household income.</P>
        <P>The person in question applied for rent supplement in December 2002. On the basis of her income at that time, that is, part-time earnings, she was required to pay towards her rent only the standard minimum contribution, which was then &euro;7.62 per week, giving a weekly rent supplement of &euro;162.40. In addition to her earnings from part-time employment the individual was subsequently awarded one-parent family payment from this Department. In the circumstances the amount of supplement payable fell to be revised to take account of the increase in household income. Her contribution towards her rent was deemed to be &euro;70.50 per week. Based on the board's appropriate maximum rent level of &euro;170 per week this gives entitlement to a weekly rent supplement of &euro;99.50.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>The person in question presented at her local health centre recently stating that she was unhappy with the decision to reduce her rent supplement. She was advised of her right to appeal against the decision and was given the appropriate appeal form to complete.</P>
        <P>It has also come to light that, when the person in question applied for one-parent family payment from my Department, she declared that in addition to her part-time earnings she was also in receipt of maintenance payments to the value of &euro;50 per week. The issue of the maintenance payments will be raised with the person in question in the course of the latest review of her case.</P>

	<P>As advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 606 of 16 December 2003 the Northern Area Health Board agreed to examine the financial support it provides to the cr&egrave;che in question following the decision to discontinue, with effect from 1 January 2004, payment of cr&egrave;che supplements under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>The board has advised that a formal application has been submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority seeking additional funding for those cr&egrave;ches it currently supports and the board is awaiting a response from the authority.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, as an exceptional measure, health boards may continue to pay existing cr&egrave;che supplements while arrangements for alternative funding are being finalised.</P>

	<P>Subject to certain conditions, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available from any other source.</P>
        <P>A person does not have to spend a specified period of time on a housing list in order to qualify for a rent supplement. Anybody who is assessed <Col N="456"/>by a housing authority as having a housing need which cannot immediately be met by the housing authority, a voluntary housing organisation or by the individual concerned will be entitled to rent supplement subject to the usual qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>An assessment of housing need may be carried out either by a local authority's housing officer or by a health board's environmental health officer acting on behalf of a local authority. The arrangements made in this regard are a matter for each local authority.</P>
