    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter of public interest: the need for the Government to provide assistance for householders and traders in Cork who have suffered significant loss and damage to their property arising from the serious flooding of the past 24 hours and for action to address the ongoing cause of regular flooding in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Finance to grant a stamp duty exemption to the facility beside Ballyowen shopping centre in Lucan. The facility is a much needed community resort which is experiencing delays in opening due to the requirement of the Revenue Commissioners that full stamp duty be paid on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the report that Mr. Benny McCullagh, a 72 year old who lived only 500 yards from Monaghan General Hospital, was forced to travel 30 miles to Cavan General Hospital by ambulance and died subsequently and the need to restore an on-call service to Monaghan General Hospital as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene to settle the dispute between poultry growers in west Limerick and Castlemahon Foods which threatens the livelihoods of the growers and 300 people <Col N="330"/>employed at Castlemahon Foods in County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the need for a statement on the damage caused by serious flooding yesterday throughout the country, particularly in the Cork area, outlining the remedial measures being taken and the additional resources to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having given the matters full consideration, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>: It is proposed to take No. 3, Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 4, Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 33, motion re Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative (resumed) to be taken immediately after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments yesterday, will the Minister for Finance comment on the status of the Dublin metro Bill which is proposed to streamline and accelerate certain procedures for metro projects and reduce costs?</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach said the Department of Health and Children was committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and clarify the legal framework for eligibility and entitlement in the health services. There is no sign of such a proposal on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contention that it is being prepared in the Department. What is the status of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not in the House yesterday and cannot comment. My understanding is that the Taoiseach stated the advice of the Attorney General was being sought on certain matters that had arisen recently. We must wait for the outcome of that advice.</P>
      <P>I understand the first Bill referred to is scheduled for next year and can say no more about it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Finance speak to the House about the progress of the Northern Ireland talks and state whether the impression that matters are stalled and the anticipated breakthrough is unlikely to happen is correct? Can the Minister make Government time available for a debate or, at least, a Government statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave the matter of a statement for the Taoiseach to respond to if asked. <Col N="331"/>The scheduling of a debate is a matter for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I made a request to adjourn the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss the state of readiness of the emergency services to deal with the flooding problems that were about to occur. Now that they have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>If you let me finish, Ceann Comhairle, I wish to ask about legislation pertinent to this matter. I mentioned it yesterday. In this city&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to hear the Deputy on this matter. There is a submission for a Private Notice Question on this matter and if I am to consider it for that, I will not have a debate on it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation to which I refer is the building control Bill to stop builders flooding this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill concerned seeks to amend and strengthen the powers of local building control authorities under the Building Control Act 1990 and to provide for the registration of the titles of architect, building surveyor and quantity surveyor. The heads of the Bill were approved by Government and it is expected it will be published in the middle of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate the Minister for Finance is taking the Order of Business. When this country voted for the Nice treaty we did not, following enlargement, put up any barriers to the inward migration of workers from the new accession states. Given that circumstance, when will the Government legislate to ensure trade union rights and wages will not be undermined by yellow-packing, so to speak, by companies employing new accession state workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has legislation been promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In particular, Irish Shipping proposes to de-man its crew. This is a serious matter. Perhaps the Minister will discuss the matter with his colleagues with a view to introducing legislation on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that specific legislation in this area was promised. I suggest that the central review committee, under the social partnership, would be the appropriate forum to discuss any issues that might arise in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the death of a 72 year old man who lived 500 yards from Monaghan General Hospital, will the Minister and Government <Col N="332"/>provide time for a debate on the disgraceful state of accident and emergency services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless a debate has already been promised, the matter is one for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>When will Second Stage of the health and social care professionals Bill be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to publish and debate a health Bill before Christmas, at which time Members will have an opportunity to raise any issues they wish under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the reported serious illness of Yasser Arafat, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Government contact the Israeli Government to ensure it gives a guarantee of safe passage to medical treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pressing matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they do not send Yasser Arafat to Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years ago, the Ombudsman directed the Minister for Finance and his Department to pay arrears of blind welfare allowance to people in receipt of pensions. The Department of Health and Children agreed the money was owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister provide the money this year to enable these people to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been ongoing for two years. Would any other section of society have to wait two years to have arrears due to them paid? The health boards and Ombudsman agree these people are due that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like an answer to my question. These people are disadvantaged and are entitled to their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question to the line Minister would be more appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ombudsman has said they are entitled to the money. If the Ceann Comhairle were due this money, he would not wait for it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="333"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring should resume his seat. He is being disorderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>These people should get their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Ring that the Independents are alive and well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that they are not independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Alive but not independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring knows well that there are plenty of Independents on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is welcome to join my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring should join the Independents. We are recruiting at present.</P>
      <P>When will this House commence a debate on the Disability Bill given 3,000 people with intellectual disability await respite care, day care and residential care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was proud to be a Minister when funding in that area was increased to &euro;80 million over a three-year period, given that at that time only &euro;1 million was provided for all emergencies. This Government has done more than any other in that area. However, more needs to be done. The Disability Bill will be debated next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the position regarding the strategic national infrastructure Bill to deal with fast-tracking major national infrastructure projects? Is that legislation in the slow lane given it has not yet come before the House? Is there a division in the Cabinet on the matter? Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, slowing things up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategic national infrastructure Bill will provide for a streamlined development and consent procedure for infrastructural projects of strategic national importance. The draft heads of that Bill are being considered before re-submission to Government next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>More redirection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance said that the Dublin metro Bill is scheduled for next year. Does he believe that Bill will come before the House next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question has already been answered. I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="334"/>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If this process is to have any meaning, we cannot have the Minister just&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have repetition on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Members on the Government side who are repeating themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation, what is the position of the geological survey of Ireland Bill? Have the heads of that Bill been agreed or discussed by Cabinet? If not, when will they be discussed? Given that previous legislation dealing with this matter was passed in 1845, how long more will it be before that Bill comes to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The year 1845 was a bad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not a particularly good year. However, I am sure the Minister will be more than anxious to update the House on this urgent issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s party was in office at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Similar to 1845, we have other priorities now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding those priorities and in the context of promised legislation, what is the precise timescale for the Bill&rsquo;s introduction to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to indicate a timescale at this point. However, the dig will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In those circumstances, I believe the Cabinet should hold an emergency meeting to discuss what has happened since 1845 because, given the rate of progress, it could be a long time before that Bill comes to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The last time there was an emergency meeting, a different Administration was in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>According to reports, there have also been a number of such meetings in the current Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government provide time to debate the issue of decentralisation? The Minister&rsquo;s colleagues were fairly flaithi&uacute;lach with money in the debate last night. Decentralisation will cost a great deal of money and this House should debate that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should know something about the matter because his col<Col N="335"/>leagues had a great deal of money to spend last night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>In every contribution I have made in this House since my election as a Deputy for Dublin South-West, I have mentioned Tallaght. I am proud of my association with Tallaght and proud of the people who live there. It is appropriate that today in particular I should stand up for the people of Tallaght. For the past two weeks the people of the area have been subjected to much negative media coverage, not only in the context of the CDI report, which is a positive report, but in regard to other issues. If one reads <i>The Echo</i>, a local Tallaght newspaper which I read every Thursday morning, one will note the manner in which Tallaght is picked on in relation to the launch of Luas, a very positive project. However, the media are now reporting it in a negative way.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of negative publicity during the past two weeks regarding the manner in which NTL has been treating the people of Tallaght and the wider south-west Dublin region. Tallaght is well used to being picked on but the report we are discussing gives us an opportunity to be positive about it, something which I do every day of my political life.</P>
      <P>I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on being able to persuade his colleagues in the Labour Party to table this Private Members&rsquo; motion. As my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said last night the Labour Party is to be complimented on a fine piece of work. I am happy to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not easily provoked. I have been in Tallaght for 35 years, though I am not from Tallaght as the critics tell me. I have <Col N="339"/>worked hard for the people there and they have been good to me. At a time when I was finding it difficult to struggle through the political system in 1997, the then Minister for Health, Dr. Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, gave me my first leg up in the community by appointing me to the board of Tallaght Hospital. In terms of my community endeavour I have never looked back. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is abroad on Government business and would have wished to be associated with this debate. I am sorry he is not here.</P>
      <P>The report is viewed positively. Last week the Taoiseach welcomed the report, said it was good and looked forward to all of us in the House working towards the ideals identified in it. I support the positive ideals of the report and compliment the childhood development initiative which produced it. I wish to put on record the various community organisations in the Tallaght west area which contributed to this report: An Cos&aacute;n, Barnardos, Brookfield Headstart pre-school and cr&egrave;che, Jobstown child care centre, Killinarden school completion programme, the Caitl&iacute;n Maud na&iacute;onra, the Rainbow House early education and child care centre, the RAPID programme, St. Aidan&rsquo;s senior school, Brookfield, St. Thomas&rsquo;s senior school, Jobstown, St. Anne&rsquo;s primary school, Fettercairn, Knockmore national school, Scoil Caitl&iacute;n Maud, the all-Irish junior school, Knockmore, St. Thomas&rsquo;s playgroup, St. Louise&rsquo;s playgroup, south Dublin county child care committee, the South Western Area Health Board, Tallaght Partnership, Youth Horizon and the YMCA which is involved in Brookfield. It is clear from that list and the other organisations I will mention later that Tallaght is a positive place. It is important to highlight that given the negative image that sometimes builds up around Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to acknowledge the presence of my neighbour and colleague, Deputy Crowe. We are all aware that Tallaght took a long time to develop. At one stage we talked about Tallaght in terms of having the population of a city but the status of a village. Some 14 years ago last Saturday, 23 October 1990, that all changed with the opening of The Square and Tallaght has never looked back. If one goes to Tallaght today one is faced with ten cranes which is a sign of much investment and progress. If one cares to look around Tallaght it has a major general hospital, a civic centre, a district library, the national basketball arena, a very successful institute of technology and all the facilities one would expect to find in a major centre of population. I invite all colleagues to go down to Abbey Street, board the Luas and go out and see what a positive place is Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party referred to the contrasts between some parts of Tallaght. As one who works hard in Tallaght we should be speaking about one Tallaght. It upsets me and the community when we put walls around parts of <Col N="340"/>Tallaght and say it is different when it should not be different. The Taoiseach used to say that, at a time of economic prosperity, it is important that all boats rise and that we pay particular attention to the small boats. It is important to take particular note of that and understand that Tallaght west which is mainly local authority estates, was built in the main by Dublin Corporation, which at that time was an absentee landlord. Happily that has changed and South Dublin County Council is in place. While everything is not perfect the position has improved enormously.</P>
      <P>The communities in Killinarden, Jobstown, Brookfield and Fettercairn are anxious to paint a positive picture of community life. Without wishing to make a political point, all those areas have had to recover from the fact that a previous coalition Government introduced a £5,000 grant to encourage people to leave the area. It took years for those estates to recover.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the progress made in Tallaght west and to put on record the various facilities and services provided in that area of my constituency. That includes enterprise community centres in Killinarden and Brookfield, both of which are managed by Tallaght working group of which I was a founder member. Recently, there have been refurbishment programmes in the Fettercairn community centre and in the Killinarden community centre. We have completed the Jobstown all-weather pitch which is a tremendous facility for that area. The playground at Jobstown community centre is also completed. The Fettercairn horse project is completed and continues to get huge amounts of Government funding which is important to that area. The all-weather pitch in Killinarden has also recently been upgraded and four local neighbour estate centres have been completed. Much building work is taking place, including a building at the Jobstown community centre, the Jadd centre and the Jobstown drugs treatment centre is being completed. The Jobstown child care centre is also being completed. A particularly worthwhile project which is under way is Citywise&rsquo;s educational recreation centre at Jobstown.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note the presence in the Visitors Gallery of my colleague, Mick Billane<b>, </b>who was the most active and popular councillor when I was a member of the council in 1991. It is regrettable that a combination of mathematics led to him losing his seat but he still has a huge role to play in so far as the people of Tallaght west are concerned. Mick Billanewas involved in the development of the idea of a swimming pool and sports hall at Tallaght west which has gone to tender. Those will be positive developments for Tallaght west and the wider Tallaght area. I have made the point at other gatherings in Tallaght that other facilities, including skateboarding facilities which are popular with the young people of Killinarden, should be provided. In nearby Brookfield, a youth and community centre is to be provided.</P><Col N="341"/>
      <P>It is important to understand there still remains much to be done in Tallaght west as in the wider Tallaght area and we should not take our eye off the difficulties being identified, so far as the drugs programme is concerned. There is a positive community reaction to the drugs scourge in Tallaght west. I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is about to announce details of a pilot programme involving St. Dominic&rsquo;s response centre and the CARPcentre, which has a new building in Killinarden, which will have &euro;90 million to deal with the cocaine problem. I look forward to that announcement for the Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>Turning to the report, one of the points which caused much upset was the reference to anti-social behaviour. I agree with other colleagues that we should support our communities in every way possible so far as combating anti-social behaviour is concerned.</P>
      <P>Some 94% of those surveyed stated that they are affected by anti-social behaviour. Just 4% report such incidents to the Garda, which represents a particular challenge the authors of the report should be complimented for highlighting. The Garda clearly has a responsibility to the community and there is a wider issue I have never been afraid to point out, that Tallaght needs more garda&iacute;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Tallaght is the country&rsquo;s third largest population centre and it is time the Garda authorities and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put their heads together to provide more garda&iacute; for Tallaght. For some years the garda&iacute; have stated that building more Garda stations is not the way forward. However, this report proposes that there should be a dedicated Garda station in Tallaght west providing a service to the people and I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine that issue. Furthermore, I am pleased the Garda authorities, following prompting from me and other colleagues, are beginning to think that the area should have its own Garda station. Such a facility would supplement services already provided by the city council and the Garda which includes regular clinics every week in Killinarden, Fettercairn and Jobstown. I understand another is to be opened in Brookfield, which is a positive development.</P>
      <P>I do not want to introduce too many red herrings but there was a reference last night to how Fianna F&aacute;il operates in areas such as Tallaght west. I do my job in Tallaght west every day and am the only public representative who runs regular weekly clinics in the estates. I am very happy to do so and draw crowds every week. If Deputies want to check on me, I am in Fettercairn community centre every Monday and on Fridays I <Col N="342"/>attend Brookfield and Killinarden community centres. Public representatives should provide such services. To this end I am a founder chairman of Jobstown community college, I am on the board of Killinarden community school and I have been on the board of Brookfield and St. Mark&rsquo;s community schools. It is important that public representatives give their time and energy to such schools.</P>
      <P>It is important that this report should attract a great deal of political support because a huge amount of effort has gone into it. We should all contribute to correcting the negative image of Tallaght and Tallaght west. To that end I invite any colleague to come with me any day to Tallaght west and see the positive work being done and to see how much the area has improved. I do not hesitate to point out that there is still a huge challenge and South Dublin County Council has a huge amount of work to do. In this context, I hope councillors of all persuasions will continue to fight to ensure that the environment is improved as much as possible.</P>
      <P>It is important that we work hard to deal with the report&rsquo;s various recommendations, particularly in respect of educational disadvantage. At a party meeting last night I acknowledged that the Minister for Education and Science has been particularly responsive in that regard and has already indicated her interest in the Tallaght west area. Moreover, I understand that she plans to accept our invitation to come to Tallaght west and see the situation for herself.</P>
      <P>When one speaks to people in Tallaght west, as I do on a daily basis, they state that not only do they want us to build on this report but to highlight the continuing community needs. In all of this it is important that we take the lead from the community rather than the other way around. Anyone who attended the launch of the report in the Plaza Hotel on Monday will have heard 200 community people speaking positively about the area and about where we want to go.</P>
      <P>It is important that we highlight the continuing needs of the area. I have already mentioned the need for a Garda station in Tallaght west, which I believe should become a reality. The swimming pool building programme should also be accelerated. Having experienced the success of Luas, there is a huge demand for it to be extended through Oldbawn to the Tallaght west estates and Citywest. It is not pie in the sky, rather the success of Luas proves that such a transport service can and should be provided.</P>
      <P>There is a need to examine educational disadvantage. New school buildings may well be needed in the extended area. In particular, the Irish school in Knockmore, Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude, requires a new building, which I hope the Department of Education and Science will address. We must also examine the need for non-formal education support. I have already raised this issue with the Minister as well as the need to appoint new educational support and youth officers, <Col N="343"/>which has been identified by Jobstown community council.</P>
      <P>I have often stated in debates on Private Members&rsquo; business that it will always be necessary for colleagues to make political points, with which I have no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>It is delivering. If the Deputy wants to come out to Tallaght some day, I will show him what has been delivered. Perhaps he might then return to his constituency and replicate what has been done. Tallaght has become a great example of what should be done. It was built the wrong way around. There were too many houses with too few facilities but we are now catching up. We have not yet done so and much more needs to be done but the Government is continuing to deliver. I do not want to make political points but, since 1997, the Government has been continuing to deliver. The reason I was lucky enough to be elected as a Deputy is that people recognised that the work was being done.</P>
      <P>It is important that the people who compiled and presented this report get our support in a non-party political manner and I hope the four Deputies who represent Tallaght will continue to give that support. There has been an enormous amount of co-operation and this report gives us a huge blueprint for the future. I thank my colleagues for bearing with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s remarks. I welcome this report, as does the Government amendment to the motion. As the Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am arranging to meet the authors of the report and examine its conclusions to see how we can progress matters. The National Children&rsquo;s Office, under my direction, has engaged in a great deal of research on children&rsquo;s welfare and the State now has a research base which it never had before. One of the interesting statistics to emerge in recent years is that the volume of consistent poverty among children has shown a considerable decrease and it is important to note that there has been such a decrease. That is not to take away from some of the disturbing findings in this report, which must be addressed by all of us, as Deputy O&rsquo;Connor stated. I look forward with my colleagues in the Government to meeting the challenges posed by this report.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there has been a huge increase in volume of national wealth in recent years nor is there any doubt that it has trickled down to all social classes. However, it has not made some fundamental changes in certain areas, <Col N="344"/>which we would like to see. There have been improvements, but much remains to be done, as Deputy O&rsquo;Connor stated.</P>
      <P>When I consider my constituency and, in particular, the Blanchardstown area, and contrast the state in which it was a decade ago with how it is today, I see a radical transformation. Likewise, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor has seen a similar radical transformation in Tallaght, which has been assisted by substantial public investment in the health service and educational and transport infrastructure. In addition to investment, we have to examine social structures, in particular, the collapse of social structures in certain neighbourhoods in the grim decade of 1980s and consider how we can rebuild them and create vibrant communities.</P>
      <P>In the programme for Government agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party in 1992, it was decided to establish partnerships. They have tried in a focused, holistic way to tackle the problem of disadvantage in their areas. They have done a great deal of work and have been in operation for more than a decade. The partnerships have been reviewed by many Ministers. They have made a signal contribution to try to pull together public policy on this area. Despite the partnerships, the volume of public investment, a favourable economic climate, considerable increase in social provision and considerable reduction in the incidents of personal taxation, especially among the lower paid, certain persistent social problems remain. Nobody is denying that on this side of the House. We have to address those social problems.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to speak on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, specifically in regard to paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the Opposition&rsquo;s motion, which calls on the House to address the factors that leave 90% of children in fear of the effects of anti-social behaviour. That need was echoed by many speakers.</P>
      <P>In regard to west Tallaght specifically &mdash; the position there mirrors that in other parts of the State &mdash; there is in operation a Garda juvenile diversion programme. The purpose of it is to provide an opportunity to divert offenders from criminal activity by providing for various alternatives to prosecution. That programme has been operating on a statutory basis since May 2002. In 2003 alone, the National Juvenile Office received 19,915 referrals relating to 17,043 individual children &mdash; children being persons under the age of 18, with the majority of such persons being the youth. Some 77% were male and 23% were female. The diversion programme has been successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. Of the children referred to the diversion programme in 2003, 50% were over the age of 16 with the balance being between the ages of seven and 17. The age at which offending commences is one of the most significant predictors of prosecution levels; the earlier the onset of <Col N="345"/>offending, the greater the number of prosecutions subsequently recorded.</P>
      <P>Garda youth diversion programmes have also been set up to challenge the anti-social or criminal inclinations of youngsters involved in crime. There are three Garda youth diversion projects in the Tallaght district, in Killinarden, Jobstown and Whitechurch, receiving total funding of &euro;295,826 this year, and these projects accommodated over 140 participants.</P>
      <P>Having pointed out the existing structures, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and myself are concerned about our youth justice system. Serious concern has been raised about offending behaviour. It is an aspect of criminal activity which is of particular concern to the Government. The incidents of violent crime and public disorder offences involving young persons are becoming too frequent. We have a sound statutory framework in the Children Act 2001. I am happy to inform the House that I have been in a position to implement and commence quite a number of provisions of this legislation. However, the Minister and myself decided more is required.</P>
      <P>We have established a task force in the Department to examine specifically how the State might better manage and target the delivery of services in the youth justice area. The task force is consulting the relevant governmental actors. It will evaluate international thinking on youth justice where advances have been made in recent years. We are particularly interested in the Youth Justice Agency in Northern Ireland which evolved from its criminal justice review. It is intended that the task force will report to the Minister and myself so that recommendations can be brought to Government next summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing time.</P>
      <P>An interesting development regarding the issues raised in the motion will be the operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill when it becomes law, in particular that part of it which will deal with the involvement of local communities in the affairs of the garda&iacute;. One of the issues raised by the motion refers to perhaps disengagement with the garda&iacute; and with law enforcement. I am confident the involvement of local community representatives, local authority members and other people with an interest in the future of Tallaght and other such districts will have a role to play at that time. I am sure that will make a difference in addressing the problems identified in the motion.</P>
      <P>It is unusual that Private Members&rsquo; business should focus on a particular area. The Green Party has generally introduced legislation or proposed minor Bills by way of Private Members&rsquo; business. The focus on a single area may reflect the fact that the Leader of the Labour Party represents this area, but I would be slow to accuse him of priming the pump by the use of this type of motion. It would be inappropriate if that was the case.</P><Col N="346"/>
      <P>I wanted to speak on this motion for two reasons, first, to point out that Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, who recently spoke on this issue, is perhaps the best advocate for his area and perhaps the person most associated with an area in this House. He has been a great advocate for the area he represents during the time I have known him in this House. It is a little unfortunate that he will find himself technically voting against the interest of his area. Anybody who knows this area and the Deputy would know that would be a poor and inaccurate reflection of the kind of work he does. The same could be said of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
      <P>Second, I want to address the question of early childhood education. A report was published last year by the Centre for Early Childhood Development in Education. Effectively, it was an audit of services in this area. One of its conclusions was that accurate information on the range and nature of early childhood education was extremely difficult to access. For that reason the report provided by the West Tallaght Childhood Development Initiative is of great importance. Effectively, politicians have no excuse now not to provide or properly target the necessary services. However, the audit of the Centre for Early Childhood Development in Education found that the provision of services was well targeted. Some 82% of services were targeted at the disadvantaged and the remaining 18% of services were targeted at those with special needs. The report discussed in this motion is of great assistance. It provides politicians with the data required to make the necessary changes to ensure that provision is properly targeted.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of that audit report is that there should be more co-ordination between Departments to ensure the delivery of services is properly targeted in those areas where they are required. If nothing else, the findings of this report should ensure there is proper co-ordination between Departments in that regard, which hitherto seems to have been lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crowe, Gregory and McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The welcome given to this report by all sides of the House must be a great source of pride to the authors and the people in the community concerned who helped compile it. As a principle of community development work, producing a report such as this and identifying problems that exist in an area, the extent to which the community can marshal resources to address those problems and where external help is needed, is always a useful exercise.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is in the third area that Government and State agencies tend to let down communities such as those in Tallaght. My experience of working in the community youth sector shows that, unfortunately, there already <Col N="347"/>exists in Departments a library of such reports on communities throughout the country. Reports similar to the one on west Tallaght could be produced on Darndale and Muirhevnam&oacute;r in Dundalk. Reports have been produced in the Mahon community in my constituency. Mahon is a good parallel to Tallaght because the two communities have similar histories. Although they have different populations, they were developed at approximately the same time. Mahon has particular advantages in that the quality of the housing is higher than that in Tallaght and lessons were learned from other parts of the country where mistakes were made. Unfortunately some of those mistakes continue to be made.</P>
      <P>Difficulties in disadvantaged communities arise from a combination of the standard of housing, housing allocation policy and the failure to achieve a proper blend of economic and social life. When the balance is out of kilter, we find that social problems arise that would not otherwise exist. Unfortunately, State agencies and the Government in particular have not been addressing them properly.</P>
      <P>In the Mahon community, my colleague councillor Chris O&rsquo;Leary has been speaking very much on the anti-social behaviour indicated in the Labour Party motion. He has suffered two attacks on his house in recent weeks. A number of approaches can be taken when an incident such as this happens. He has taken the approach, which I support, of suggesting that if anti-social behaviour is to stop or decrease in such communities, it must be on the basis that people speak out. The law-abiding citizens of such communities, who comprise the great majority, must be allowed to speak and be afforded the right to live appropriately.</P>
      <P>Returning to the central aspects of this motion, there are a number of Tallaght-related issues that the Labour Party is seeking to promote. They have a wider context, as evidenced in similar communities throughout the country. The call for the Tallaght Garda station to have divisional status is fully supported by the Green Party. As highlighted in Deputy O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s contribution, the fact that west Tallaght, which must have a population equivalent of that of Kilkenny, does not have a Garda station shows how badly wrong our planning has gone in that community.</P>
      <P>The issue of child care will be covered by other Members so I will speak about the RAPID programme. The motion calls for the programme to be restored to fund in 2005 areas such as Tallaght that were targeted in an original Government announcement prior to the general election of 2002. RAPID is the cruellest acronym that was ever developed by a Department. RAPID funding was meant to be directed into 26 communities around the country, but very little additional funding has been provided in many of them. This has only added to the burden of the residents. In effect, the Government has cheated these communities. I support this motion and I would like the Government to address the issues it raises to <Col N="348"/>meet the needs of the 26 identified areas and many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. There has been some criticism of the report of the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative but I welcome the fact that both the Government and Labour Party welcome it. It does focus on the problems that exist in the west Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>The endemic problem in west Tallaght is poverty, which has been systemic down through the years. Regardless of what the Government says about different programmes designed to address it, the reality is that the unemployment rate in the area is double the national average and over half the children living in the area are still depending on State benefits. In this debate we need to talk about how we will address these problems.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor referred to the policing problem. Many of the problems faced by the community are triggered by poverty. Policing is a huge issue. The closest contact people have with the police is when they try to report a crime. The immediate difficulty in the Tallaght area is trying to get through to the local Garda station. The garda&iacute; have been telling people for years that the telephone system in the station will be upgraded, but I recently received a letter from the Minister stating that there is no such plan. Even at this basic level, there is a problem. If there is crime happening in one&rsquo;s area, one cannot get in touch with the garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Another problem that has been mentioned is that there are not enough garda&iacute;. Could we make a comparison with other parts on the country in this regard? The reply from the Minister was that this would cost too much and waste Garda resources. However, if one asks Members of this House if there is a crime problem in Tallaght, they will certainly say there is. If one asks them privately whether they believe there should be more garda&iacute; in Tallaght, they will say they do. However, this view does not seem to have drifted into the mind of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The report does not cover the anger, frustration, sense of abandonment and sense that no one is listening felt by the people of Tallaght, but it does come up with solutions. On the crime problem, a report is to be released next week entitled Youth Needs in Tallaght 2004. It refers to the need for a forum and the fact that young people feel isolated from the garda&iacute;. One positive solution would be a forum in which young people and other members of the community could sit down in a neutral environment to address their problems.</P>
      <P>There is also a drug problem in west Tallaght which, again, is related to poverty. The community has been trying to address it. If people are asked whether there is a need to double the Garda resources in the area, they will answer in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>Last night Members referred to playgrounds that are to be opened in Tallaght. We already <Col N="349"/>have a playground in Jobstown but it is closed for two days per week because there are no staff to supervise it. There is talk of providing three more playgrounds. Will they be staffed? People talk of joining the dots but it does not require a knowledge of rocket science to know that playgrounds need to be supervised if they are to remain open. Similarly, if there are no people to open other facilities in the area, difficulties will arise.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the community has twice the national average level of unemployment, yet CE schemes and JI schemes were cut at a time when the community was crying out for facilities. These cuts had a knock-on effect.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister about education and she stated her Department would examine the ideas in the report. I would like confirmation that the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and<?oasys _jy?>Children and those responsible for the RAPID programme will actually look at the report. I welcome the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that he will meet its authors.</P>
      <P>The report refers to solution-based approaches. We need solutions to the problems that have been affecting west Tallaght down through the years. We can outline all the programmes that exist but this is not enough. Redress is not happening fast enough and children are growing up in an unacceptable environment. The report outlines the solutions to the problems and we are asking that the Government take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this motion on the report of the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative and acknowledge the work of all those who helped produce it. As the motion states, the conditions in Tallaght are replicated in other disadvantaged communities throughout the country, nowhere more so than in my constituency, particularly in parts of the north inner city.</P>
      <P>It demonstrates that this country is a very divided and unequal society. Various recent reports suggested that Ireland is one of the most unequal societies in the developed world. This seems unbelievable in the context of the years of extreme affluence, with budgetary surpluses of billions. The budgetary policy in this State for many years has served to benefit most those who need it least and has failed to make any effort to redistribute wealth so that the weaker sections of our people might benefit and a fairer society emerge.</P>
      <P>At least the Progressive Democrats do not attempt to disguise their political philosophy in regard to inequality. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, boasts and believes that inequality is necessary and good for the economy. However, the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion is not so forthright. Instead it reeks of hypocrisy when it refers to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to social inclusion, while the same Government obliges people on the lowest incomes, and even pen<Col N="350"/>sioners, to pay tax while those earning millions pay no tax. Governments whose persistent budgetary policy is to favour the rich cannot claim to be committed to social inclusion, yet the Government amendment perversely claims to be directing public expenditure towards meeting the needs of low income households. Any objective analysis of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats budgetary policy will demonstrate that those who benefit most are those who are already affluent. To say otherwise is simply false and hypocritical. This is why there are areas like west Tallaght, the north inner city and many others like them. The Government&rsquo;s amendment refers to its strong social and affordable housing programme, which is laughable, yet tragic for the unfortunate families trying to get a home of their own, and this coming from a Government that capitulated to the builders and developers who refused to deliver the 20% social and affordable housing.</P>
      <P>The west Tallaght report highlights the importance of education for disadvantaged children and calls for the expansion of programmes designed to improve early school provision, and rightly so. The recent OECD report indicated that, despite the years of the Celtic tiger, Ireland remains a blackspot when it comes to early school provision. I have drawn attention in this House to community-based after school projects in my area, doing the work which the OECD pointed out as vital, yet in short supply. These same after school projects are undermined by lack of funding and a constant struggle to keep going. Despite the importance of education and tackling disadvantage, local schools in my area contacted me to say that a recent change in Department policy will result in the most vulnerable disadvantaged schools in the inner city losing badly needed resource teachers, while larger advantaged schools, such as those in Foxrock, will gain additional resource teachers. This is apparently on the basis that allocations will be based on size rather than on need. It is yet another example of what the Government refers to as commitment to social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Unless there is a radical change in Government policy to redirect resources to areas in need and to the most disadvantaged people, extreme inequality will continue to be a blackspot on our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me an opportunity to speak to the motion today, which expresses concern at the serious picture of inequality and social deprivation in some parts of the State, and not just in Deputy O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s constituency. Right in the middle of a wealthy country there is massive poverty, anti-social behaviour, serious crime, bad housing and blatant neglect. That is the reality and the content of the motion before us today. It is the reality for many people in society, for whom it is a nightmare. Children are intimidated and cannot sleep at night and the elderly are bolted into their homes each night at 7 p.m. in <Col N="351"/>fear of attack. This is the dark side of our vibrant healthy economy. It is something we must face up to and I welcome the fact that the report does so. It is why I welcome the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative and let us hope its recommendations are implemented. We now need action, and I mean decisive action. When we talk about poverty, let us stop beating around the bush and say straight out it is about a quality education service, a decent home and a decent job. If one has these three things one will never be poor.</P>
      <P>I urge people involved in studies and surveys to reflect on Karl Marx&rsquo;s advice when he stated, &ldquo;The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.&rdquo; This is what the motion is about. It is about the urgent need for radical change and putting the resources, no matter how unpopular, into the most needy and the most disadvantaged. Education, a home and a job are always the starting point. The rest will fall into place and we cannot allow a situation where Ireland has one of the lowest levels of social protection expenditure in Europe. As a proportion of GNP, the Irish figure is 16.5% compared to the pre-enlargement EU figure of 27.3%. In Sweden, for example, the figure is 32.3%. Social protection expenditure includes expenditure on sickness, old age and disability, which relates to expenditure from taxation and social insurance. Societies with high levels of social protection typically have low levels of poverty risk and <i>vice versa.</i> In other words, despite our great economic growth, the Government is not delivering to the most needy in society.</P>
      <P>It is time for tough decisions to be made for working people and the lower paid. It is time their issues were put at the top of the political agenda. This initiative is the beginning of urgently needed change. We need to invest in disadvantaged communities. Investment begins at pre-school and primary level, otherwise it is a waste of time. If we are serious about democracy, there needs to be more community development and more social justice. We also need active labour market policies to assist people into good quality work. We need a strong social protection system and good and accessible provision in areas of education, health care, housing and community and public transport. These are the key issues for investment. Then we will lift people out of poverty, and for those who are still doubtful, it also lifts and develops economic growth. A society that turns its back on the 20% of its poorest is doomed to failure. This report is an opportunity to deal with this problem. I urge Deputies to support the report because it is a breath of fresh air.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves certain fundamental questions. After seven years in power &mdash; I address this question to Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and other Ministers &mdash; why are there still people living in poverty? These people are not just living in the Deputies&rsquo; con<Col N="352"/>stituency, they also live in my constituency. There is massive social and educational disadvantage, where people do not have a proper home and the elderly are totally intimidated. After seven years in power by Fianna F&aacute;il, and the massive wealth and resources of the State, why are people still living in these circumstances? This is the reality of the debate. I urge all Deputies to support the motion.</P>

	<P>This is an unusual Private Members&rsquo; motion because it deals with a specific report about a specific community, which I welcome. Defining solutions, which the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative has done, is essentially about ensuring that politics can respond to people&rsquo;s needs at local level.</P>
      <P>The Government must respond because what is set out in this report is a record of struggle but also of strength. If communities are supported, they can attain remarkable achievements. Without support and solid measures, they suffer, and children in particular. There is an onus on the Government not simply to put out the vague aspirational words that are contained in this amendment but to present the solid measures that will make a real difference and bring about real change. If the report&rsquo;s challenge is met by the Government, it will bring benefits not only to west Tallaght but to all areas of disadvantage. This report is simply the portrait of one such community but there are many others with the same problems and strengths in all our constituencies.</P>
      <P>The recent report on child poverty by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance parallels points made in the report on west Tallaght. The issue of children&rsquo;s poverty is fundamentally attached to the issue of access, or the blocking of access, to health care for children and their parents. A medical card is a passport to accessing health care for people on low incomes and the Government has promised repeatedly to introduce 200,000 additional medical cards. Rather than an increase, however, 101,000 medical cards have been lost and the system has become more unfair and inaccessible for thousands of people. The chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children argued in his annual report a number of years ago that all children should have medical cards. Instead, the extraordinary decision is made by the same two parties in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, to extend medical card eligibility not to children of families on low incomes who are living in poverty, but to those people over 70 years of age not previously eligible, many of whom are at the richer end of that age group. The wealthy over-70s were <Col N="353"/>given medical cards by the Government while children continue to be neglected.</P>
      <P>If any one of the 11 millionaires who paid no tax in 2001 is over 70, he or she qualifies for a medical card while children of low income families in west Tallaght and other areas cannot get a medical card because the income thresholds are so low. In one case, a family doctor working quite close to west Tallaght was unable to supply the newest and best medication to a 21 year old patient suffering from schizophrenia because the latter&rsquo;s income exceeds the limit of &euro;142 per week. This represents a deep injustice to that young man but is only one of many such injustices. This injustice with regard to health care has been bolstered and deepened by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats. We must ensure this is recognised and that a new, radical approach is taken to tackle inequality.</P>
      <P>Some 15% of the children who were questioned during the research for this report suffer chronic poor health, including depression, eating disorders and problems managing simple tasks. Some 41% live with adults experiencing depression and 26% live with adults who are chronically ill. There is an extraordinary set-up with regard to health care in that the communities and individuals who suffer most ill-health because of their social class are the ones who experience most difficulty in accessing health care. Access is in inverse proportion to need.</P>
      <P>This is especially true with regard to mental health, which is rarely spoken about in general discussions about health care. We talk about other things, such as inequality in terms of life expectancy, cancer and heart conditions, all of which are real. It has been highlighted in this report, particularly with regard to children and young people, that lack of access to mental health care is a real and pervasive issue. The percentage of money spent on mental health has plummeted while the Celtic tiger economy has grown.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that different research documents in the area of health care reflect and affirm the findings of each other. A report carried out by the Irish Psychiatric Association is of great interest. Concerns are expressed in this report about the layout of services and how they relate to need. When the researchers analysed the availability of services, they found an inverse proportion between the provision and the level of deprivation and extent of need. Various measures were used to conduct this research, such as the number of medical cards in an area, a simple and straightforward measure of deprivation. The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The results of this survey indicate that for many key services within mental health, clinical resources tend to be concentrated in the least deprived rather than the most deprived areas. The most deprived areas have significantly fewer acute beds, larger sector sizes and a greater temporary consultant to consultant psychiatric staffing ratio. There are almost significant trends for the less deprived areas to <Col N="354"/>have better access to psychology and OT services. Basic speciality services were not readily accessible to the vast majority of services surveyed. Lastly, services with higher medical card holder ratios are significantly more likely to have only a temporary clinical director in post.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a damning indictment of the failure of this Government to ensure the fruits of the Celtic tiger are distributed to those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. It will astonish many in Europe and throughout the world to hear we are debating an issue of child poverty in a country which has been describing itself globally as one of the great successes of modern times. The report that is the subject of this motion is akin to those great reports of the 19th century which drew attention to the tenements in England and the deprivation of young children. The Government should accept this motion and announce, for example, that it will combine the existing services by way of intervention to put into practice these concrete proposals.</P>
      <P>The report is significant in a number of ways. For example, it is research-based and makes reference to eight or nine international models which could be tried out. It also suggests a strategy for combining different Departments and agencies to secure the best type of intervention. Sadly, the Government&rsquo;s response speaks of the total amount which has been spent nationally on housing and other types of social provisions. For example, &euro;1.8 billion has been spent on social housing. Buried under this assertion is the reality that some 68 houses were provided last year out of the tens of thousands under social housing because the Government favours the handing over of housing to speculative developers and rewarding the latter, with significant consequences.</P>
      <P>The report is a disgrace and makes a mockery of the term &ldquo;republic&rdquo;. It makes people like me go back to those early documents of the founding of the State which stated that every child would be treated equally. How ashamed members of this Government should be to walk through Tallaght, or any of the many more places like it. I remember visiting Tallaght during my time as Minister to discuss the building of the Tallaght theatre and I met many different people with positive proposals about how to help their community.</P>
      <P>What struck me when I read the Tallaght report was that Tallaght has just under 7,000 children under the age of three. The kind of question the people of Tallaght must ask parliamentarians, not just those in the constituency but those in this House, is how life will change for the 6,900 plus children under the age of three. Will they have better prospects of attending school regularly. In 2004, is it not extraordinary that in some areas in the north of Dublin city where food is provided in the morning, school attendance rises? Where <Col N="355"/>hungry children are given meals at school, attendance improves.</P>
      <P>We have a welfare Act in existence that is supposed to establish education welfare officers who might liaise between children, the home, the school and the environment, yet these positions have not been filled. People have also been written off and we have gone through the details on this previously. We had a change of Government in 1973 at a time when a war against poverty was under way under the Johnson regime. Initiatives on poverty were also taken in Britain and Combat Poverty was established in Ireland, and then as a European programme. I remember all the debates suggested, for example, that the poor are poor because of characteristics associated with themselves.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has suggested we should help those who are making an effort to help themselves, as if there was no need for a structural intervention for children who will be poor after another cycle or to prevent this happening. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made outrageous statements, from his well-heeled privileged background. He never listens to people, but he has a continually bullying tone. He talks to himself. His suggestion that inequality is good for society reaches back to the 18th century for an archaic version of life and society to impose on people. How dare he suggest this? How can he speak of equality if he says the children of the children who are poor must look forward to even less in terms of education, nutrition and services of the State?</P>
      <P>How can the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government justify the situation where when 46% of housing is local authority housing, children are being reared in damp unsuitable conditions that are not conducive to their development, education or job prospects? Where also is the report of the task force about which we heard so much and which was funded under RAPID, the money for which has largely disappeared? It was supposed to make a comprehensive intervention across agencies and Departments to address this issue.</P>
      <P>This issue concerns a fundamental philosophical policy position. It is the Progressive Democrats&rsquo;s version of life, to which they have converted Fianna F&aacute;il, that everyone will be lifted in the end. It is rather like as Deputy Gregory said, those who are buried in poverty should hope that one day one of their number will rise to be like the McDowells and the rest. In its resolution the Government is opposing our conscious intervention towards changing society to establish and make the first few steps towards equality. That is a shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased with the opportunity to speak on this motion. I was interested to see some people from Tallaght in the Visitors Gallery last <Col N="356"/>night and again today. They are here to see what hope the Government will give them with regard to the positions they hold and the groups they represent.</P>
      <P>Volunteerism keeps a society together and it has done so for generations. One must wonder when one examines the Government amendment to this motion what these volunteers can take home from this debate. What message can they bring to their particular groups in Tallaght about what funding they will get or what future each group will have? The message they get will reflect the message that groups throughout the country will get, both in my constituency and others, rural and urban.</P>
      <P>This motion is concerned with ensuring the success of the various groups and the development of their communities. It was concerned initially with Tallaght where people felt they were hard done by because many of their basic human needs were not supported. This has come out strongly. The aspect of the report that has most affected us is that 90% of children are in fear of anti-social behaviour. It is for this reason I mention the volunteers. They are important, whether as part of a residents&rsquo; association, a cr&egrave;che or a sports club. They support children after school, during recreation and in the home. We must improve funding for such groups in areas like Tallaght to ensure they can support the social needs in the area.</P>
      <P>The number of children living in damp and despair in overcrowded housing has doubled in the years from 1991 to 2002. What the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, did with regard to the rent subsidy, means that families are deprived of their subsidy. They must live in hovels, not alone in Tallaght, but in every town and city. It is unthinkable that when a person comes to the door of the community welfare officer, who must follow the guidelines of the Department, they are told the place they are going into is too good. It is unbelievable that we must witness this and then have to try and appeal that decision. Is it not an awful indictment of this Government and the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs that they are told the place is too good for them? This is what the people in the Visitors Gallery and people around the country must think.</P>
      <P>They must wonder what we are doing here. Can we not instil in the Government the belief that this is wrong? We are depriving the children of a decent standard of living. They have not a home of which they can be proud or to which they can bring their school friends. I hope the current Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, who has stated that he will investigate the savage 16 cuts, will do so and return some pride to the children of this country. He must allow the children to mix with other children, be proud of what they have and bring their friends to their homes. If that happens we will see an essential mix which will improve the standard of living. This mix in society will allow volunteers <Col N="357"/>to work in their community and improve society. It will assist the decline in anti-social behaviour and the result will be that the 90% of the children in Tallaght, who are reflected in many other areas, will be able to go out and mix socially without fear. Surely they are entitled to that. They are entitled to enjoy themselves from the time they get up in the morning.</P>
      <P>Children are entitled to go to play-school, national school, clubs etc. We must ensure that people in towns like Tallaght, Athy, Newbridge and Mallow etc. can do this. In that way we will have standards acceptable to all of us. However, there is nothing in the Government amendment that proves the Government is willing to achieve this. I urge a review of its amendment and ask it to ensure funding is provided for the Tallaght strategy. The volunteers in the Visitors Gallery, who are the heart and soul of their community, must be allowed to go back to their groups with positive results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the childhood development initiative in Tallaght west for its report which highlights the issues faced by the Tallaght west community. Research such as this is valuable and can be positive. We must be careful to pick the positive aspects from reports such as this and prevent people from presenting them with a negative spin. The report contains interesting and worthwhile suggestions and information, which is being given serious consideration.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>One could find similar situations in communities in other parts of the country and certainly in parts of Dublin with which I am more familiar. It would be wrong to claim that these problems exist in one part of the city and nowhere else. Much good work is being done by families and communities in Tallaght west and many people in those communities are proving to be successful citizens.</P>
      <P>When I was first elected to Dublin City Council in the middle of the 1980s, the corporation was building massive estates in Tallaght and Clondalkin and around the fringe of west Dublin. Estates were designated as Neilstown A, Neilstown B and somewhere else C. We would build 400 houses in this green field and another 400 houses in that green field. I understand the political pressure to provide houses which existed at the time, but those involved did not look down the road. I can understand that now having been Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Nevertheless, we must realise that providing houses is not the solution. We must also provide facilities and build sustainable communities. We did not do so in the 1970s and early 1980s when the economy was not going well and many problems arose as a result.</P>
      <P>If we are trying to solve these problems and pull together the services provided by different Departments, we must try to be reasonable. Opposition Members are inclined to treat reports <Col N="358"/>such as this in a political way and to raise red herrings to which I will not refer in the short time available to me.</P>
      <P>In large parts of Tallaght there are thriving communities. If this report had been done 15 years ago, it would probably have shown a far worse situation. Tallaght now has The Square, a shopping centre, Luas, the hospital and the institute of technology. It is a more developed place than it was. I will not bore the House by listing what various Departments are doing. No single solution will solve the problems experienced by areas such as Tallaght. Communities need improvements in education, employment, facilities and living conditions. Above all, they need hope. Tallaght has been given hope. The people of Tallaght are not being told they are living in a less desirable area. We are telling them what has been done and what is being done.</P>
      <P>People are succeeding and providing good role models in areas such as Tallaght. Communities can be assured that the Government is committed to doing more. The Government has a responsibility to provide structures and plans but that cannot be done without the support of the community. There are wonderful community people in Tallaght. It is vital that they work with the system. I know from my experience in my constituency that one can do nothing without the support of the people. Government help is available. I will not list the vast supports which have been put into education but they show the support given by Government and the progress that has been made in recent years.</P>
      <P>While recognising the progress that has been made, especially in employment and participation in education, no one can be complacent. I certainly am not complacent about the issues in west Tallaght or anywhere else. The issues dealt with in the report are interesting. They highlight and bring home to Government what needs to be done, if any of us were forgetting or did not know. The Government will be unrelenting in continuing to ensure that Tallaght west and other areas like it are targeted by the range of Departments. We are doing that and we will continue to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Penrose. In his response, the Minister of State said repeatedly that the report contained good and interesting suggestions.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>If I had an hour, I could list all the good work the Government has done. Central <Col N="359"/>heating systems have been installed in houses, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment all those involved in producing the Tallaght west childhood development initiative report. Much time, work, energy, thought, ideas and meetings were involved in drawing up the report. It is clear that there are people who are prepared to work for their own area. These people seek the support of Government and the local authorities in providing the infrastructure necessary to improve the quality of life for themselves and their children. Given its implications for so many people in this area the report must not be allowed to gather dust on a Minister&rsquo;s shelf. Too much is at stake. My party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, will not allow that to happen, whether in or out of Government. I share his concern on that matter.</P>
      <P>The planners and decision makers in Dublin have much to answer for. Some 25 or 30 years ago, decisions were taken to take living communities from the centre of Dublin and drop them into green fields in the middle of nowhere near the border between County Dublin and counties Meath and Kildare. Estates were unfinished and there were no shops, schools, roads or public lighting. Above all, there were no jobs. Unemployment in the region of 80% and 85% was not unusual in some of these areas. In addition, the young people who were moved out to new estates lost contact with their families in the city centre because there was no public transport. Young parents had to push prams and go-cars three and four miles across muddy fields to reach public transport to shops and to their families. Planners and decision makers have much to answer for.</P>
      <P>Parents and community activists are now saying enough is enough. They want to do something themselves and they want the support of Government and the local authorities. We are one of the richest countries in Europe. During the Celtic tiger era, Ireland had one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and it still has. We have seen many benefits. We have created jobs and unemployment has fallen. We may have a successful economy but do we have a successful and all-embracing society?</P>
      <P>Ask the people who feel disadvantaged or maginalised, those who feel there is little or no support for them. They may even feel there is no benefit in casting their votes at the ballot box. The Government may deny it but we have a relatively high level of poverty and social exclusion in various parts of the greater Dublin area and throughout the country. Political will and leadership both at national and local level must be provided to help the people cited in this report.</P>
      <P>More children than adults face the risk of poverty. Groups of children particularly at risk are those living in welfare-dependent or other low-income households, those living in lone-parent households, children in large families and those with disability. The Government introduced a <Col N="360"/>restrictive and prudent policy but this time last year it made savings of &euro;58 million on some of the most disadvantaged people to whom the report refers. The savings were made on training, education and jobs. Most of those affected were hit by the &euro;58 million in cutbacks. It is no use blaming the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because at the same time the Government made an extra &euro;67 million available to the rich and famous in the racing industry. How can we provide social justice and equality in such circumstances?</P>
      <P>The report can be applied to various areas of the country. This group has said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough. We&rsquo;re going to help ourselves. We&rsquo;re looking to the Government and local authorities for help&rdquo;. It is no use stating that there are good and interesting aspects in this report. It is up to the Government to build on the report to ensure that people living in such environments, whether in Tallaght in my constituency of Dublin North, in Limerick or in Galway, will have an opportunity to benefit from these recommendations that must be implemented by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should work to implement this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Labour Party has taken the opportunity of moving this important motion. I thank everyone who has supported the broad thrust of the motion before the House, as well as acknowledging the work of those people from Tallaght who participated in this project and brought it to fruition. The situation as outlined by my colleagues is replicated around the country. The people of Tallaght have played an important role in bringing this report to the point where it has become a matter of political focus.</P>
      <P>I was the eldest of ten children and our family lived in a three-bedroom house. It was warm and snug but we did not have running water and there was a dry closet. No matter how bad things were at that time, however, the Government of the day &mdash; it was nearly a one party State at the time &mdash; led by &Eacute;amon de Valera and Se&aacute;n Lemass, provided milk for young children and shoes through the community welfare system. In one form or another we were helped as a family. Nowadays, however, when the Government has to make a choice, the first thing it does is to take the hatchet to any scheme that benefits the less well off. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, is trying to develop a policy to reverse the worst excesses of what has happened as a result of cutbacks in the community employment and job initiative schemes. My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, referred to this matter in yesterday&rsquo;s debate. Those schemes worked tremendously in the community by providing cr&egrave;ches, meals, environmental enhancement programmes and places where people could meet. Instead of abolishing the schemes, the Government should have developed them into <Col N="361"/>urban and rural initiatives encompassing such aspects of community endeavour.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, will make strong and detailed proposals to deal with this matter. That is the type of action we need. When there is a choice to be made, the Government always comes down on the side of the rich. Look at what happened as a result of this Government&rsquo;s past budgets. If one earned &euro;100,000 per year or more, one gained approximately &euro;600 per week as a result of the past seven annual budgets. However, down at the social welfare end of the scale, a person would have gained only &euro;50 per week over the same period. The Government is perpetuating the division and inequality, which goes to the heart of this motion. That political choice underlines the difference between the Government&rsquo;s philosophy and that for which the Labour Party stands. The Minister of State may not like it but we stand for something different. We believe that if there are choices to be made, the poor should not bear the brunt of hard decisions but should be included instead.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s brother, who is leading the country as Taoiseach, talks about the decline in consistent levels of poverty but it is an inappropriate measure of real poverty. This is a regressive policy that the Taoiseach has tried to justify by saying that consistent poverty is in decline. When the Government launched the national anti-poverty strategy in 1997, it adopted the concept of consistent poverty to assess ongoing levels of poverty. It continues to use that measure despite the fact that it is not relevant to actual poverty as experienced by people around the country.</P>
      <P>The more widely used and internationally accepted definition of poverty is &ldquo;any household with an income of less than half the average household income&rdquo;. The Government does not refer to that definition because it is inconvenient. The consistent poverty measure was developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997 and included eight specific indicators of deprivation, such as whether one could afford a waterproof overcoat or had not eaten a substantial meal in the past week.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum has added its concerns to the continuing use of consistent poverty measures, stating that &ldquo;the credibility and usefulness of monitoring poverty targets will be undermined if the camera remains trained on what may no longer move&rdquo;. Given that <Col N="362"/>the chairman of the NESC is also Secretary General to the Government and the Department of the Taoiseach, is it possible that the Taoiseach is unaware of the views expressed in the NESC report?</P>
      <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland has also published a report. I know the Minister of State does not pay much heed to CORI, apart from inviting them down to Inchydoney for photo opportunities. CORI&rsquo;s report, entitled Priority for Fairness, makes it clear that it does not accept this measurement as being adequate, adding &ldquo;Consequently, we welcome the conclusion by the ESRI that on its own this measurement does not tell the whole story, nor does it represent the best way to frame a poverty target in current circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State is framing budgets on an incorrect basis how can he tackle the fundamentals as outlined by the authors of the excellent report in the motion before the House? If the Minister of State and his Government colleagues do not know the correct measure of poverty themselves, how in the name of God can they tackle the problems outlined in the report? The Minister for Social and Family Affairs disgraced the Government and the country by visiting the hatchet of &euro;58 million worth of cuts on ordinary working people and lone parents. The back to education allowance was swiped.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister of State an example in case he is not aware. I know a young girl who qualified for the back to education allowance. Having completed two years in college, she became pregnant and, 11 months later, wanted to start her third year. Everyone tells us that education is the best way out of poverty. However, because the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, had increased the qualifying period from six months to 15 months, the right of centre Government decided this girl who wanted to start her third year and qualify for a degree should not be included under the pretext of abuses of the system.</P>
      <P>It is time to wake up and get away from the ideology of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that permeates the Government. It is time for the people to wake up and give the Government one hell of a boot out of office. For the past seven years this Government and the previous one have destroyed the fabric of society by undermining and attacking at all times those on the margins.</P>

    <Title>Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure to contribute to the discussion on this Bill. Its provisions are designed to ensure the continued consistency of Irish citizenship law with the State&rsquo;s international obligations under the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, to which this State has been a party since 1983. Ireland is totally in line with international practice in exercising the right to protect its citizenship. Britain does not <Col N="364"/>grant citizenship to the children of parents who are not British subjects. The passing of this Bill will ensure that we have closed the loopholes in our laws that have allowed citizenship on birth to children born to non-national parents in this country.</P>
      <P>In EU countries, the citizenship application age can range from 18 to 23 years. The terms of this Bill are more generous and less demanding than those that generally obtain in Europe. The terms of the Bill will be welcomed by the citizens of this country; they are fair, just and non-discriminatory. The legislation is being enacted to close loopholes in our citizenship laws and its intent is to provide the framework within which our legislators will be able to determine, through due process of law, if a person born in this State to non-national parents has an entitlement to Irish citizenship. It also clearly guarantees the right of <Col N="365"/>Irish citizenship to persons born in this island to any parent who is entitled to be an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>In April 2004, the Irish and British Governments issued a joint interpretative declaration that stated their positions relative to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In straightforward, unambiguous language, it was stated that no obligation could be imposed on either country to confer Irish nationality on persons born in any part of Ireland whose parents did not have a sufficient connection with the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the passing of the referendum, the law recognised the citizenship rights of children of all parents who were legally entitled to reside in the State. It also allowed the children of non-nationals legally resident in this country, born North or South, to acquire Irish citizenship at birth. In these cases, there was no restriction on the period of residence. These categories of persons were specifically exempted from the terms of this Bill to ensure Irish citizenship law remains consistent with the Good Friday Agreement. This and other provisions are designed to guarantee that the conditions for acquiring Irish citizenship are similar, North and South.</P>
      <P>This Bill rules out the granting of citizenship to those who seek it on the grounds of major investment in this country at this time. It also builds in safeguards to ensure that such a scheme cannot be introduced in the future.</P>
      <P>The question of citizenship rights in the case of a child born to non-national parents, North or South, will in future be subject to determination through our legal system. The facts of any application will have to be verified by specific documentation as required by the Bill when enacted. Establishing proof will require a statutory declaration. Regulations will specify the type of documentation that is acceptable in support of a declaration to verify the period of residence. This declaration, accompanied by the required documentation, will be recognised by the passport authority as evidence of the reckonability of the parent&rsquo;s period of residence in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that time spent in this State as a student or as an asylum seeker is not reckonable for the purpose of calculation of this period of residency. There will be no special entitlement to citizenship for a non-national child born while on a ship or aircraft that has come to Ireland. There will also not be any right for students or asylum seekers to ask that a period of residence, North or South, be taken into account in a claim to determine their entitlements to Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>I want to make myself clear on one issue. We in this State have the right to respect and cherish our Irish citizenship. We in this House carry the responsibility of protecting that citizenship. We could not allow our natural stature to be diminished by those who would have blatantly con<Col N="366"/>tinued to manipulate our laws. They would deny us the right to expect that our nationality be given the level of respect and esteem it so richly deserves.</P>
      <P>Members all know I was vilified publicly for airing this view in this House and in the media in January 2002. My views have been decisively proven to be an accurate reflection of the national viewpoint. I was berated by very vocal interest groups which denounced what they described as my racist and bigoted views when I spoke out on the abuse of our hospitality by some illegal immigrants. I never uttered a word which could be interpreted as racist. They said I was out of touch with the public. Time has proven that those groups are well able to express themselves, but it has also shown that they are capable of seriously misinterpreting the public mind. Proof of what I say is a matter of public record. The recent referendum was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of those who voted. I would like to hear those same people explain that result. No doubt they will say that people were misled by the wording and that the terms of the referendum were not sufficiently explained. Yesterday, the Minister spoke at length on this matter.</P>
      <P>The result of the referendum cannot be misinterpreted. The people believed that many illegal immigrants and some non-nationals were taking advantage of our citizenship laws. To curb this unlawful practice, they voted wholeheartedly to endorse the Government&rsquo;s referendum proposals. They authorised this Government to introduce amending legislation to bring our immigration laws into line with general European and worldwide legislation in this area. Our citizens were asked to express an opinion, and they have done so loudly and clearly. I thank the public for its unqualified support for me at a time of great personal pressure from unrelenting attacks from all sides. It is right that we should embody the massive consensus of our people into the laws of our land.</P>
      <P>Those laws are not designed to turn away genuine asylum seekers who are fleeing from political persecution in their native lands. Ireland has always made them welcome. I have always welcomed all genuine asylum seekers who wish to be our new citizens in this land. I have always spoken up for, and made representations on behalf of, immigrants who come here legally. I have worked for those who have approached me and I have been able to help many of them. I have enabled them to integrate and to make a valued contribution to our society.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I have also expressed my views many times in public on the blatant abuse of the Irish immigration system prior to the general election of 2002. I have always said that those who wish to speak out on issues of public concern should not be afraid to do so. They are obliged to do so even though they know they face the likelihood of being attacked by vested interests. As I said, I have been viciously targeted by some sections of the Dublin media, by spokespersons <Col N="367"/>for Amnesty International and by bodies such as the NASC and the IRC which represent immigrant rights. Those groups are entitled to speak out on behalf of genuine asylum seekers or for any cause they may espouse, but that does not endow them with the God-given right to deny me the opportunity to speak out about the exploitation of our society and national hospitality by the many illegal immigrants who have come here in the guise of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>I have already highlighted the activities of illegal immigrants claiming Irish citizenship on the grounds that they had given birth to a child in this country. This loophole in our citizenship laws was identified after the enactment of the Good Friday Agreement. It was used by non-national mothers who arrived in our country in the late stages of pregnancy and who left as soon as they had given birth to their little babies. The mothers of the children had come to Ireland as a result of legal advice received abroad. They were told their children would automatically become Irish citizens and that they could use that as a lever to secure citizenship for the whole family. They were making a mockery of our citizenship. This blatant exploitation of Irish hospitality was done at considerable expense to Irish taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I spoke out strongly on this issue but received little political support for my stand. The Labour Party leadership at that time attacked me personally in the House because of my stated views which were also those of my constituents. In Cork, Labour Party representatives were unusually silent because they knew what I was saying was the view of those I was elected to represent. They were afraid to speak out against the party line. They did not reflect the concerns being expressed to them by their constituents and mine in Cork. In doing so, they condemned me by their silence.</P>
      <P>Some Dublin press columnists, members of political parties and many representatives of immigration groups accused me of being a racist. They have never substantiated their unfounded allegations. Even when they made a formal complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions, which was investigated by the Garda, it was found I had no case to answer. When I invited them to do so, they were unable to quote the racist comments I had allegedly made. They chose the easy option; they continued to demonise me. Their pressure did not deter me from exposing the behaviour of those illegal immigrants who were blatantly abusing our national welfare system and the hospitality of our nation.</P>
      <P>I refer to a press statement by the Nigerian Embassy in which it accused some of its nationals of making unfounded allegations against the country in a desperate attempt to remain in Ireland when their asylum applications failed. The embassy accused bogus Nigerian asylum seekers of making terrible and unfounded allegations against their country of origin in order to stay in Ireland at all costs. Incidentally, &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; <Col N="368"/>is a familiar word which the Minister has used many times and for which nobody has vilified him, even though I was when I used the word two years ago. The statement from the embassy accused journalists and non-governmental organisations of encouraging asylum seekers to vilify Nigeria as a means of staying in Ireland. It also said that while it is the fundamental human right of everyone to seek a better life wherever he or she feels it is available, the choice of vilifying Nigeria in a desperate bid for a perceived better life with encouragement from the Irish media and non-governmental organisations is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that any Nigerian who seeks to discredit his or her country in spite of efforts undertaken by the Government and people of Nigeria to improve the quality of life for everyone is not worthy of being called a good Nigerian. It referred to a person who said she was sentenced to death by stoning by an Islamic court in Nigeria. The embassy said that having investigated this matter, it found it to be false and that her allegation had done damage by presenting the country as a barbaric and lawless society. It also called on another failed asylum seeker to say where and when she had been prosecuted in Nigeria for campaigning against female genital mutilation. According to the embassy, the Nigerian Government was at the forefront of the campaign against female genital mutilation, a practice which has its roots in traditional beliefs in some communities but is illegal and is no longer widespread. The statement called on journalists to check claims made by asylum seekers with the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin or the Irish Embassy in the Nigerian capital.</P>
      <P>I refer to that statement because it is important we have the proper facts when dealing with this issue. When I made my statement, I was in possession of what I considered at the time to be facts. The Government&rsquo;s policy at that time is not what it is now. I recall that I was chastised by all sides of the House and not just by the Opposition. Some Members of the Opposition who chastised me and who are no longer Members of this House almost reached over and attacked me for making my statement in January 2002. It gives me great pleasure to support the Minister with this timely and progressive legislation and I look forward to voting for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I come to this debate from a slightly different perspective to that of Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn. I still have serious concerns for people from countries such as Nigeria and the like who seek asylum. I do not think we can take as gospel statements from the Nigerian Embassy as to the standard of its civil rights or the way it treats people who oppose the political regime in that country. The same is true of many other countries. The Bill should not, therefore, affect those who legitimately seek asylum having fled countries in which they were the victims of discrimination.</P><Col N="369"/>
      <P>The Bill provides for amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act to put into effect changes necessitated by the recent referendum on citizenship. In the referendum, 79% of the electorate voted for a change to the Constitution and there is no doubt the majority of the population was seeking the introduction of some control on immigration following the Catherine Chen case. In that case, the European Court allowed Lavette Chen, as the mother of an Irish citizen, the right to free movement within the European Union provided she had adequate health insurance and enough resources to prevent her becoming a burden on the State. As the Supreme Court had ruled earlier that the parents of Irish-born children did not have an automatic right to residency, Mrs. Chen does not have the right to live in Ireland. While the EU ruling applies in all member states, Irish citizenship law is governed by our Constitution and legislation. The EU decision was very restrictive as it allowed only the parents of Irish citizens with adequate resources to remain here.</P>
      <P>I am not sure it was the intention of the Irish electorate not to deport non-national parents of Irish or EU citizens provided they had adequate insurance and resources. The referendum decision imposes an obligation on the Minister to define clearly who is entitled to Irish citizenship, which he does in the Bill. It is welcome that it provides for the ending of the passports for sale scheme which was abused by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government under Mr. Charles Haughey. The legislation also contains provisions to prevent the re-introduction of this scheme of investment-based naturalisation. Other provisions in the Bill address the citizenship of the children of foreign diplomats serving here, the rules for the naturalisation of non-national children born in Ireland and issues of British citizenship as they relate to Northern Ireland. Most of the provisions of the legislation reflect the contents of the draft Bill published in April 2004 as part of the document on the citizenship referendum.</P>
      <P>Whatever the Government&rsquo;s interpretation of the result of the referendum, I believe the people expect it to demonstrate tolerance and generosity in dealing with individual cases. The main concern of the electorate was to prevent the use of the Irish system as a back door to the European Union. It also sought to prevent the pregnancy tourism which resulted from the fact that Ireland was the only member state providing an automatic right to citizenship on the basis of birth. As these issues have been addressed, we must now move on. The referendum was held and the Minister has the power to introduce legislation which identifies clearly who is entitled to Irish citizenship. The Supreme Court has already decided that the parents of Irish citizens do not have an automatic right to residency.</P>
      <P>While parents of citizens do not have an automatic right to residency, they should not be deprived of residency status in most cases nor should an Irish citizen baby be forced to emigrate <Col N="370"/>with its parents or suffer abandonment here. Fine Gael contends that there is no reason to fail to regularise the status of the estimated 11,000 non-national parents of Irish citizens who applied for residency on the basis of the birth here of a child prior to the Supreme Court decision of January 2003. Admittedly, these people chose to come to Ireland because the law as it stood provided the right of residency to the parents of Irish citizens. The Supreme Court decision and the referendum result mean these circumstances cannot recur and the applicants will not increase in number beyond 11,000. The back door is closed and the wishes of the people as expressed in the referendum are being implemented in the Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister thinks the result of the referendum is a resounding endorsement of a tough and hard-headed approach to this issue, he is greatly mistaken. While the people have spoken clearly on the larger issue, they continue to want compassion and generosity to be shown to individual families and Irish babies. The parents of Irish-born children who applied legitimately and in good faith for leave to remain in this country should be granted an amnesty. Many of these people have spent long years in Ireland and their Irish citizen children know no other home. Many parents who came here in search of a better life for themselves and their families would abandon their children in Ireland for the sake of their futures rather than bring them back to the hell from which they originally escaped. Given the changed conditions, common decency and justice demand that we give these families a break and grant the 11,000 parents of Irish children the right to residency.</P>
      <P>As the constitutional position has been clarified, we must examine closely all other aspects of this matter including asylum structures, work visas and work permits. While work visas and permits are generally matters of Irish law, asylum provisions must abide by international laws and humanitarian considerations. There is some evidence to suggest we do not take our obligations as seriously as we should. In its submission on this issue, Amnesty International stated that Irish immigration officials with responsibility for the granting or denial of access to the national territory should be trained comprehensively in refugee and human rights law. This training should be carried out to reduce the risk of mistakes at points of entry. Under national law, there is an absolute prohibition on the return of a person to a state in which he or she is at risk of ill treatment. Amnesty International is clear that the way to prevent mistakes is to provide for the presence of independent observers at arrival stations at all times to monitor all refusals of entry. These observers should have the power to intervene if necessary.</P>
      <P>There is a concern that carrier liability legislation to penalise carriers whose passengers arrive in Ireland without adequate documentation or visas must not have the effect of preventing asylum seekers obtaining access to <Col N="371"/>this country. Immigration policy must be applied in accordance with human rights laws. International standards of refugee protection recognise that people fleeing human rights violations are often not in a position to obtain proper documentation. Asylum seekers must not be penalised for this reason alone.</P>
      <P>Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state. As a nation, we must apply this principle to all categories of person. We must especially apply it to the 11,000 parents of Irish citizens who have applied for the right of residency by announcing a general amnesty to provide it to them. It is now 18 months since the Supreme Court upheld the right of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deport families of children born in Ireland. Approximately 11,000 immigrant families have been living in a legal limbo since then. Recognising the plight of these families who applied for residency rights before the Supreme Court judgment, the Catholic bishops said that the only moral response was to allow them remain in the country. Sister Stanislaus Kennedy of the Irish Immigrant Council has strongly endorsed that stance.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As a nation, we are in serious breach of Article 16 of the European Convention on Human Rights as far as asylum seekers are concerned. We also have serious problems in regard to refugees and work permit holders. The Irish Immigrant Council found difficulties experienced by people with work visas and wishing to have their spouses or families join them here to be totally unacceptable. The bureaucracy surrounding such applications often involves delays of up to two years. The council also found that the official decision-making process was discretionary and non-transparent. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must come up with a system that allows these 50,000 low skilled workers to be re-united with their spouses and families. Such a move would address issues of loneliness and isolation, would create a supportive family unit structure and would provide a second income for such families.</P>
      <P>Discrimination against work permit holders is not tolerable under international law. Apart from our being in breach of the human rights convention, it makes no sense for us as a nation. To sustain our economic growth we need 50,000 extra workers each year. In these circumstances, it is far better that these workers live happily in a family environment thereby enabling them to work and contribute to our society and economy.</P>
      <P>In a recent report, the Irish Immigrant Council summed up our current immigration crisis. Immigrant workers in Ireland encounter exploitation, bureaucratic confusion, difficulties with family life, trouble integrating into Irish society and everyday racism. According to the 2002 census, <Col N="372"/>6% of the population living in Ireland are non-Irish citizens. Some 2,000 non-EU graduates are the backbone of the medical service yet they and many non-EU nurses face recurrent problems with visas and, in particular, family re-unification. However, most immigrant workers are at the lower end of the national wage scale. The Irish Immigrant Council report highlights the piecemeal market-driven nature of immigration policy. This is symbolised by the fact that work permits are still issued to employers and not individual workers or their families. There is plenty of evidence that system has led to massive exploitation. Many such cases have been clearly documented by the individuals concerned and by many in the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has acknowledged this problem in the past. However, nothing has been done about it. Work permits should be issued to employees. This would at least allow them to change employer within a particular sector.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland will need immigrants for the foreseeable future, official policy is based on the assumption that their stay is temporary. Immigrants must be viewed as potential permanent members of society and should be provided with equal rights just short of citizenship. Now that the Minister has the constitutional changes he sought, it is hoped he will treat immigrant issues with the coolness and kindness he envisaged five years ago. If he does, and if he implements the laws urgently, fairly and with compassion he can expect total co-operation and support from Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this legislation. Before commenting on the detailed provisions of the legislation, it is important to point out that this is the end of a fairly long and acrimonious debate since the beginning of the year. The debate which continued for many months before and during the referendum campaign centred on one issue, namely, whether it is appropriate to deal in this day and age with citizenship by way of constitutional protection or provision or by way of legislation. There is no doubt that the argument that legislation is the only appropriate way to deal with the intricacies and complex areas involved in the issue of immigration and citizenship ultimately won the day.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of the most globalised countries in the world. We have one of the most migratory populations in the world. The world, as we all know, is becoming a much smaller place. Mass travel by air, sea, rail and road in every shape and form has become the norm. For that reason, the world has become a much more complex place. It is not open to us as a country or as a Legislature to provide in our Constitution simple one-line or one-paragraph bland pronouncements as to what constitutes citizenship in the complex world in which we now live.</P><Col N="373"/>
      <P>For that reason, the referendum which took place last June was wholly appropriate. It conferred on this House the right to make detailed provisions on the right to citizenship. It would not be possible to insert into the Constitution the type of detailed provisions we are discussing today in the same way that it was not possible to provide in the Constitution for issues such as divorce in all its varied aspects. The constitutional referendum merely provided, subject to minor criteria, that it was up to the House to legislate through the Oireachtas on the detailed provisions of that issue.</P>
      <P>The Chen case, a final decision on which was handed down this week, retrospectively provided 100% legitimacy for the course of action which was adopted by the Government in the weeks and months preceding the referendum despite fairly vociferous and trenchant opposition inside and outside this House. The Advocate General&rsquo;s position and the subsequent decision of the European Court of Justice in the Chen case has made it abundantly clear that unique among all the European Union countries, Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional position was being abused by people inside and outside the European Union. It is often possible to argue these cases in the abstract and to use anecdotal evidence and research or the experience of Members of this House in that regard. Here we had a singular, concrete case where it was shown in black and white that a non-citizen attempted, specifically by design in a planned and meticulous way, to look at our Constitution and examine the loopholes with a clear intention to abuse and use that loophole. The decision of the European Court of Justice and the Advocate General&rsquo;s decision was clear when they said this would not be possible were it not for the unique position set out in the Irish Constitution. That arose because of an unintentional provision in the Constitution arising out of the Good Friday Agreement in 1996. It was never the intention that the constitutional provisions arising from that Agreement would lead to the position in which we found ourselves through no fault of those who drafted the Agreement or the referendum subsequent to that Agreement. I compliment those involved in the drafting of that Agreement and there is no way they can be blamed for the situation that developed. As we saw in the Chencase, before going to her medical advisers she went to her legal advisers to find the best way to secure a future for her child as a citizen of the European Union. Her legal advisers, having examined all the provisions of citizenship laws and immigration laws of each EU state, at great expense to Mrs. Chen,concluded that the best way to proceed would be to acquire Irish citizenship through birth in this country, something which was never envisaged when the constitutional provision was made.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Irish citizenship should be available to those from other shores who have lived in and contributed to Irish society and who wish to apply for citizenship. We should ensure that Irish-<Col N="374"/>born citizens of non-national parents who have lived here for a number of years acquire Irish citizenship at birth. This is right and proper and underpins the welcoming nature we have always had in Ireland. We must end the abuse of our citizenship law which has enabled those with no connection with Ireland to travel here, claim citizenship for their child at birth, depart immediately never to return and yet have all the benefits of Irish citizenship conferred on them by our Constitution. To allow people with no connection to use Irish citizenship and our Constitution in an attempt to get around basic immigration controls in the European Union would certainly call into question the integrity of Irish citizenship in other jurisdictions, something which would reflect badly on this House and the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>Prior to the referendum, an amount of misinformation had been spread about the reasons for and the impact of the referendum and the legislation which was published at the time. The reality is that sensible regulation of citizenship is an important part of ensuring that there continues to be a generous welcome in Ireland for immigrants. Ireland is the most globalised economy in the world and our continuing success depends on us being an open and welcoming country for those who come to live and work here. The Government has pursued an open policy in terms of economic immigration. That is the reason the number of work permits granted to non-EU nationals has increased from 6,250 in 1999 to 47,551 in 2003. Ireland is the only pre-May 2004 EU member state to grant residency and working rights to citizens of the ten new EU states from the date of accession. That is why we will continue to have one of the most liberal citizenship laws in Europe following the passage of this legislation. That point needs to be reiterated. Despite all the misinformed comments, we have taken in and welcomed people who have contributed enormously to our economy. Ireland would not be the country it is were it not for the measures and the attitude adopted in the late 1990s to welcome people into this country. That is a separate issue from the right to citizenship which is a cherished and important right of everybody who has gained that right. It underscores the reason citizenship rights should not be abused.</P>
      <P>Those who claim that this legislation is racist are being cynical and disingenuous. If the legislation is passed, there will continue to be no racial basis to our citizenship law. The only requirement in the legislation is a period of residency of the parent in Ireland. It will not change the constitutional right to Irish citizenship of any child, North or South, born to at least one parent. It will not affect the Good Friday Agreement and it will not prevent those who do not require citizenship at birth from acquiring it at a later stage. That is welcome. It does not rule out citizenship, even for those who were not born here, which was the basis of the Chen case. Neither will it deprive anybody of citizenship entitlements they <Col N="375"/>had prior to enactment of this legislation and the referendum.</P>
      <P>The simple and straightforward effect of the legislation and the referendum in June is that it will close a significant legal loophole which was open to abuse and which was abused by non-nationals. It will remove the constitutional incentive for women to put themselves and their unborn children at risk by travelling here while heavily pregnant. It will provide positive recognition of the contribution of those who have been resident in the State for at least three years by conferring Irish citizenship on their children at birth. The referendum showed in a most emphatic way that the vast majority of people accepted that a loophole in our citizenship laws was being abused and needed fixing. I challenged before the referendum and I challenge now anybody else to propose a more appropriate way of dealing with the issue which developed during the past five years. It was the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to make a modest but necessary proposal to resolve the issue and, therefore, I accept the legislation.</P>
      <P>This was not a proposal that just came out of the bag when it became obvious our citizenship laws were being abused and it was not a knee-jerk proposal to hold a constitutional referendum. Nobody in the House should ever propose a constitutional referendum without a proper and appropriate basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be an abuse but the reality is that nobody put forward an alternative method in which to deal with the situation that arose and that was recognised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago, the constitutional review group made it clear that amendment to the Constitution was not the means by which we should deal with the issues we are discussing today. This is a modest Bill, although it runs to more than 12 sections and it would never be possible to include such detail in the Constitution given that circumstances change in a fast moving world. We would not be in a position to amend the legislation to take account of technical changes and changes in society or migration which may occur. It is not reasonable to suggest that every time unforeseen circumstances arise we should revert to the people with a constitutional referendum.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sections of the Bill that make impossible, abuses of our citizenship laws such as the passports for sale affair of the 1980s and 1990s. It is correct and consistent that such abuses are dealt with in this Bill and it underlines that this is the appropriate manner in which to deal with the issue. The other abuses that arose as an unintended consequence of the Good Friday Agreement have also been legislated for.</P><Col N="376"/>
      <P>At all times, our legislation much be consistent with international agreements on human rights, to which we are bound. We must respect those agreements and the fundamental human rights enshrined in the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. For that reason all legislation introduced in the House, in particular that which deals with non-nationals, must be in full compliance with all our international and national obligations.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we provide major constitutional protection to non-nationals, irrespective of what might be provided for in this Bill or in international obligations. The Constitution provides substantial protections that are not provided in many other European countries. Moreover, in many respects it is more generous than provisions in many other European countries and, in that context, we are fortunate to have a written Constitution. It is vital that when this legislation is challenged in the courts, in respect of which there have already been signals, it stands up to the scrutiny of the High and Supreme Courts and is consistent with our well-developed jurisprudence in human rights. This issue must not be lost in our debate.</P>
      <P>I have not heard any other reasonable proposal to deal with the situation that has arisen in the past ten years other than by way of empowering this House, by way of constitutional amendment, to introduce the sort of reasonable legislation that is before the House today. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this Bill. I have listened with interest to the statements of Deputies, particularly that of Deputy Peter Power, which have been interesting and informative.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the outburst of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform yesterday. He jumped around like a rooster in a hayfield and protested loudly about the way he was misrepresented and mistreated in the House. I thought he was a grown-up boy who is able to look after himself. Whining about the treatment a Minister gets when he or she introduces a Bill to the House is a new departure.</P>

	<P>We have come to expect a more robust approach from the Minister. I suggest the whining comes from the time he climbed a ladder in those far off days. I suspect a low-flying aircraft buzzed him at the time, which is causing some disorientation, with the result that he has adopted an attitude that he is the victim of constant victimisation. There was no intention on the part of the Opposition to make life any more difficult for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I recall, the Minister waltzed into the House last June to introduce the enabling legislation and his opening remarks were that anyone who opposed the legislation was a racist. Those are not my words but his. They may have been off-script but he stated them nonetheless. I do not accept any blame for generating a debate in the House.</P>

	<P>That is correct but what does that mean? What is its implication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite different from what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State obviously has his way of interpreting statements. I have my way of interpreting the Minster&rsquo;s remarks and the Minister of State knows full well what was intended.</P>
      <P>Irish people, more than most, should know about emigration for economic reasons. One of the issues that has been debated is whether people have the right to emigrate for economic reasons. It is a natural activity for people to engage in for themselves and their families even if it is not always permitted. The suggestion that this is totally alien to modern society is wrong. It is as natural as certain Ministers suggesting that the Civil Service should migrate to certain parts of the country, although the Minster of State has not been very successful in advocating that. He should not proceed too far down that road. I know what the Minister of State is thinking, let alone what he will say.</P>
      <P>We need to treat our immigrants in the manner in which we would like to be treated ourselves. There is no point in our complaining about other countries that do not treat immigrants well, when we suggest that in order to address a situation we need to follow that route. From our history we should have learned the need to recognise the needs of those who are less fortunate than ourselves. When the people and this House are given <Col N="378"/>the opportunity, we need to keep such issues in mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to his anticipating that the people would be able to differentiate between the issue of the local elections and that of the referendum. He was being a little coy when he went down that route. That was not his intention, rather it was that they might be confused but, fortunately, they were not. With the benefit of the 20:20 vision of hindsight, he can reflect that the people were brilliant to be able to separate the two issues to the extent that they did. They might have been harsh on him, the Government and his party, but that is the way they did it, and more power to them for recognising that.</P>
      <P>Some Members would have fairly regular contact with the immigration authorities and many personnel there are helpful, but some are not. That should be borne in mind. I make this point by way of constructive criticism. I would not like to be a non-national having to deal with one or two of the officials, and one in particular, in the immigration services, with whom I, as a public representative, have had to engage. I caution those who have the notion that this is a politically correct society. My kind advice would be that people in the front-line have a tough job. We all know that. Theirs is a difficult job but they should also recognise that the people with whom they deal may also be in a tough position and may not be able to look after themselves or express themselves in language that they can make themselves understood. In such circumstances, special care should be taken to ensure that the needs of individuals are carefully assessed. Dealing directly with the Minister&rsquo;s office on these issues is a rewarding exercise in terms of the response and the willingness of the persons concerned to listen to the argument made and to make a constructive response.</P>
      <P>Such a constructive response is what is important. One must not rely on hearsay or anecdotal evidence but on direct evidence from the cases with which we all deal from time to time. I recognise the procedures that must be gone through in the assessment of an applicant for refugee or asylum status, but when those procedures have been followed and a deportation is proposed and planned, I am a little uneasy as to the degree of the investigation that takes place. If it is as thorough as it should be, it should entail a careful examination of the circumstances in that person&rsquo;s country of origin to which he or she is likely to be deported, the reasons that person had to leave there in the first instance and whether they have been addressed. In other words, it should be ensured that the deportee can be returned to his or her country without being in fear of his or her life or subject to persecution for religious, cultural, ethnic or other reasons. While the Minister would say this is being done, and would be able to produce the evidence under the relevant Act that it has been done, I am not convinced of that. I have tabled questions from time to time requesting information relating to individ<Col N="379"/>ual cases and from the information received to date it seems that we have been lucky. However, we should remember that if a person is deported from here and suffers a threat to, or the loss of, his or her life or from religious or other persecution, that would reflect poorly on the country from hence that person was deported. I strongly request that this be borne in mind particularly in future. I am mindful of one or two cases recently aired in this House in respect of which other people asked similar questions.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the safety and well-being of the deportee is carefully considered to the extent of the deporting government being reassured that all will be well if and when the deportee returns home. I know full well that persons about to be deported do their best to state their case, even to exaggerate, embellish and emphasise the elements of it that favour them. That is only natural and that is what happens in court. Ministers should know about that. The defendant and the prosecution always do their best to emphasise and embellish their case. That is the way the system works. However, in these circumstances, lack of thorough investigation into a person&rsquo;s circumstances could pose a threat to the life of that person or to the lives of family members. We need to bear that in mind for the foreseeable future. The passing of this legislation will not provide a measure to address that issue, but it is one we need to bear in mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, in his initial outburst, attempted to analyse the thoughts and thinking in Fine Gael. I thought he had left our party a long time ago. There was no necessity for him to pay a return visit. If he wishes to visit us at any time in the future, we will entertain him and look after him in keeping with the manner in which he would expect to be treated. He can be assured that the attitude of Fine Gael to this legislation has been at all times constructive and helpful, but that does not mean that we, as an Opposition party, do not have the right to question the Government, even though we may agree in principle with the legislation being debated. Our duty, and that of all Opposition parties, is to ensure that we thoroughly question not only the Minister and his proposals but his intentions in the event that they might not be as clearly evident as he or she might like to think.</P>
      <P>Asylum or refugee seekers not being allowed to work here has caused a problem for those people in that they find this approach demeaning. In most cases, these people are more than anxious to work. Many of them have participated in various training schemes to assist them in the event of their obtaining work. The Government&rsquo;s approach is negative and unnecessary. It should be a simple matter to put in place a regime whereby a person entering the country seeking refugee or asylum status could at least have a limited work permit, even if that person had to report to the authorities on a regular basis. Such a change in policy would be beneficial for such <Col N="380"/>people and for the country. It would be extremely positive in terms of their sense of well-being and it would be illustrative to the rest of the population who would like that change to happen. Members of the public know that it is contradictory to say to a person on arrival here that we will allow that person to remain in a holding centre or a residence until such time as we have determined that person&rsquo;s status but that person shall not work in the meantime because that would be offensive to us. That position is crazy and it should not be the case.</P>
      <P>The amendment Fine Gael intends to table to propose an amnesty in this regard is realistic and helpful. I hope the Minister will accept it. Addressing this issue would be as simple as that. There is no reason he should not accept such an amendment. Such a measure would eliminate the concern and anxieties of many parents whose children were born here, some of whom have been separated and have been returned to their country of origin. It would be a step towards addressing this issue, but it will not solve all the problems. We cannot solve the problems associated with this issue in a day, but it would be a constructive step if the Minister were to accept that proposal and incorporate it in the legislation, thereby ensuring that the issue in respect of what has happened heretofore would be resolved.</P>
      <P>On this issue, I have stated in the House that everybody respects the right of a country to have a proper immigration policy. Obviously, one cannot have immigrants entering at all times from all over the world. Most other countries have an immigration policy. However, it is the degree to which such a policy becomes restrictive that we need to be careful about. We need to consider the degree to which it would be alien and objectionable to us if it were applied to Irish emigrants. That is the barometer we should use in assessing this legislation.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will state our immigration policy is the most liberal in the world, but it is a fact that it is not. It is a policy nevertheless and is intended to deal with circumstances that did not obtain some years ago, at which time our economy did not make Ireland a desirable destination. It was undesirable and this could be the case again.</P>
      <P>There are still many undocumented Irish people in the United States. They come to us all the time asking how we can help them. What concerns me is the inevitable consequences of the system that bears down on them such that they are often open to exploitation if they remain in the country for some years without documentation or if they have inadequate papers and bank account details. A great burden is placed on them because they know that if they return to Ireland they will never be allowed back to the US. The inevitable guillotine that descends upon these emigrants, barring them from the US forever and excluding them from their friends and families, is very harsh. Surely it must be possible to have some kind of amnesty to accommodate <Col N="381"/>them, as was the case in the past. Although this does not relate to the Bill we are considering, it should be borne in mind in the context of a discussion on immigration.</P>
      <P>Although the worldwide security position is more sensitive now than it was some years ago, we still need to treat immigrants and emigrants in the way we would be like to be treated ourselves. We should ask ourselves seriously whether we would be happy to be treated in a particular fashion if we were in their shoes.</P>
      <P>The next issue I want to address is the subject of a parliamentary question today and was raised in the House previously. It concerns a prominent Irish national who was detained and questioned by the immigration authorities when he went abroad to our neighbours a week or ten days ago. I am sure he was not known to the British authorities but the kind of questioning to which he was subjected was appalling. I am at a loss to know the kind of training that would prompt people to ask ridiculous questions about one&rsquo;s relatives, mother&rsquo;s maiden name or father&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s maiden name and about other matters irrelevant to the issue concerned. Apart from this, the abject bad manners and bad attitude that the questioning represents is appalling. This matter will not be addressed in this Bill but it is one from which we can learn. I hope we learn on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the following in his speech:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Bill [the immigration and residence Bill] will provide Government with effective tools for managing inward migration and for developing and implementing policies to meet the evolving needs of Irish society. Preparatory work for that Bill is advancing in my Department and I expect to launch a discussion document on that legislation soon.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I hope the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill will be fair when put into operation. If not, I hope the Minister will have the good grace to return to the House to reformulate it. I have personal reservations about it and am concerned about it. Perhaps my fears are groundless. Many members of my family emigrated many years ago. I am quite sure that it was not a nice time to be an immigrant and I am not so sure that it is a nice time to be one today because they are treated with a certain amount of suspicion.</P>

	<P>On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s remarks on the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, while I am not here to defend the Minister &mdash; he is well able to defend himself &mdash; many of the comments made before this debate and during the referendum campaign centred on what he was saying rather than on the substance of the referendum or this Bill. Deputy John Bruton announced on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night that he was going for a drink with Deputy Durkan after the programme. Perhaps it went to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that if he joins me for a drink, he will see how far it goes to my head. I encourage him to buy the next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Some months ago the Minister set out in clear terms exactly what the referendum and this Bill involved. The issues raised at the time had little or nothing to do with the referendum. The issue of asylum seekers and refugees is emotive and it certainly caused much division within the Opposition parties, as a result of which we had a very poor debate thereon.</P>
      <P>Sometimes when Members raise such emotive and sensitive issues in the public arena, it can cause opinions to go pretty wild. We must be careful about how we present the Bill to the public. A calm approach, as adopted in the House yesterday and today, is better than the approach used heretofore. It allows us to tease out some of the issues that concern us. I supported the referendum and support what the Government is doing.</P>
      <P>From my work with asylum seeker groups in Kilkenny and other counties, I have gained an understanding of the problems they face and the way in which this Bill and the lack of a proper immigration policy will impact upon them. All the ethnic groups fully understood, long before they came to Ireland, that there was an easy way to gain Irish citizenship, and that is why they arrived on these shores. They would accept that at first hand. They were the very ones who were prepared to come and exploit the system that existed at the time. Equally so, they expected the Irish Government to take some stand on the practice in which they were engaged and that, at some stage, it would be brought to an end. They would tell one this if one took the time to listen to what they were saying. Therefore, the referendum simply confirms our position and states it in black and white terms. This position is now being supported by the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the need for an immigration policy. Together with the Bill, we must acknowledge that there is next to nothing in regard to an immigration policy and the system operated at present by the reception and integration agency lacks humanity and compassion. Much work needs to be done to bring the system up to scratch in terms of what the people would expect. I do not expect the system to allow any number of people to gain entry to this country, work, be supported and so on. There is a limit to what Irish society can take. A balance must be struck in terms of the numbers of people allowed into the country and supported by Irish society so that integration can take place in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging the need to control the system, the effort made to do so a number of years ago was a complete disaster. Thousands of people arrived here and the response from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was less than helpful. Local communities, such as my own in Kilkenny city, which reached out and <Col N="383"/>were willing to help, co-operate and assist with integration, the process laid down by the Department and what the RIA was doing were simply dumped on by the Department. Land was purchased to house asylum seekers in the same way one would pen cattle, which is not acceptable. Wearing my hat as Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I find it amazing that these buildings and land remain unused while the money that could be obtained from the sale of these properties could not be put to better use in the context of the services being provided. There were little or no services for people who came here in the early years. The health boards and local communities were swamped and the Government&rsquo;s policy at the time was to respond by penning these people in, holding them in an area and dealing with them in a most inhumane way. There was no compassion or understanding of community involvement in support of these people by communities who understood what Deputy Durkan spoke about. These communities understood emigration and what our people had to go through and are going through in America and the UK.</P>
      <P>While the public understood what was needed and the compassion required, it was not understood, and still remains misunderstood, by the Government, which is unacceptable. The Minister outlined in his speech ways to address the issue, including the need for an immigration policy. It is fine to state it in this House but what is required is action which must be based on our experience with the RIA and the system in operation. It is wrong to hold 60 women from different ethnic groups in a place close to my constituency without any support. It is wrong to ask a group of 90 men and women to go through the process laid down by the Department without proper assistance. I am aware there are economic migrants in the country and that some people will be somewhere else tomorrow. It happened to us when we emigrated and it is happening in this country now for other ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>I know that some people abuse the system but we must deal with the genuine cases in a better fashion. I have met many people who are trying to get across their case in their own language and who do not understand properly either the system or the language. If one takes the time to listen to them as they go through the tribunal, some of them have horrific stories to tell that will not be questioned by embassies. We must sometimes question the message sent out by embassies if we are to strike a balance in the system between the Government or whatever is in place in the countries from where these people have fled. We must make an effort to put in place proper structures for these stories to be told. When they are told, if the result of the process is negative and the case must be appealed on humanitarian grounds, that appeal must be treated in a constructive way. There must be a real process. We cannot send these people into another cul-de-sac. The <Col N="384"/>Government and society must deal properly with the issue and, at the moment, that is not happening. We need the system to be fast and fair because the numbers of people who come to my clinic who are locked into the system for four or five years are too great to be tolerated. The Minister should act on his own words and introduce a system which will be fast and fair and which will deliver a response to those who are waiting.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the possibility of work, not for everyone who arrives here and is locked into the present system but for those who are seen to be genuine and awaiting a response. These people should be allowed under licence to do some sort of work. It is degrading to find themselves under curfew in this country, which is the case in these centres. People who have qualifications and are willing to work and contribute to the economy, which is experiencing great growth rates, should be allowed do so. If they are qualified and able to work, we should reach out in an organised way and constructively put in place opportunities for these people to gain some sort of employment. Those who cannot step up to the employment mark should at least be allowed to gain some form of education for which they are applying. Sometimes they are qualified and able to enter into education, but they are being told that because they are illegal, they cannot take up a course, which is incredible. If this were happening to Irish citizens in America, the UK or elsewhere in the world, we would be standing up in this House demanding change of the other countries. We fought with America and got an amnesty for people at various times during their stay. Admittedly, there are others in America, some of whom are married and living in fear of being deported. In recognising our past, we should help immigrants to this country because there has been enough talk about the issue.</P>
      <P>On the act of deportation, I tabled a parliamentary question last week about a young man who was not just fleeing his country but fleeing the system in Ireland. He was married to an Irish girl and was the father of a child. It must have been the fastest deportation I have witnessed because, having drawn attention to the case, within days the man was deported. Members will forgive me for being somewhat suspicious of the system. I was informed in the reply to my parliamentary question that the case was not known to the authorities. I made it known to the authorities and it was their responsibility to question this man&rsquo;s bona fides and establish whether he was married and a father. That is all they had to do. Now he has been deported while his wife and child remain in the country. The chance of his return is probably nil because his paperwork has been stamped to indicate his deportation. I will table another parliamentary question to ask the Minister to reconsider this case.</P>
      <P>There are people with more than one Irish-born child who are not legally resident. A person in such a situation in County Kilkenny wanted to return home to visit his sister who was dying of <Col N="385"/>cancer. He was refused the limited window of opportunity to do this and told he would not be permitted re-entry if he decided to go. This is reprehensible. I accept that we are learning and that this is a novel situation, as the Minister observed. We must create flexibility within the imperfect system, however, to ensure that cases like this are not only heard but dealt with compassionately and with some humanity. These are the elements that are missing from the system, which I encounter every week in my clinic.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Our first steps were wrong and we continue to be wrong. We continue to misunderstand support groups, the members of which are sometimes dismissed as do-gooders in general comment. When people fall foul of the reception and integration agency, they may be sent from a location with which they are familiar, placed at a distance from the legal system if they are moved from Dublin to Kilkenny, for example, and plucked suddenly from their small number of friends. There is no comeback from the agency. When I made representations on behalf of one client, I did not even get a response. I assure the Minister and his officials that I will take further action on this client&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Deputy McGuinness tried to contact the agency by telephone? It is impossible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It is similar to every other service. One accesses a voice message service and is referred further down the line. This House must become more relevant in this regard and the RIA and other relevant services must be made directly accountable to the House.</P>
      <P>The issue of work permits is not part of this Bill but has been commented upon. I do not wish to make a broad statement on this matter but am concerned with problems in a minority of cases. These relate to people who are already here and those who will come in future. The Minister has referred to the need for reform in this area. Further reform is needed. I have met too many people with work permits who believe they are prisoners to an employer who treats them unfairly. The system is so inflexible that it does not allow for a change of employment without the necessity for bureaucratic somersaults. The system must be changed and made more realistic in terms of the country we live in today.</P>
      <P>The other appeal I make to the Minister is with regard to the many employees, especially in the health service, who find themselves having to deal on a daily basis with the strains of providing a good service while also dealing with bureaucracy to allow them to remain in the country. I know of one man who could not renew his driver&rsquo;s licence because his paperwork was out of date. As a consequence, he could not go to work from Kilkenny to Waterford because he had no transport and he failed to meet his work deadlines. It is disgraceful that we do not acknowledge this is happening and <Col N="386"/>that we do not change the system. The time has come for change.</P>
      <P>Another issue to tackle, which is of significant importance for the health service, is the situation of married people with work permits. The husbands and wives of such people cannot be brought into the country without a significant amount of red tape. If they succeed in coming here to be with their spouses, it is difficult for them, many of whom are qualified professionals, to gain employment without enduring more excessive bureaucracy. If we have permitted such people to work within the system, there should be sufficient flexibility to allow them to be with their partners and families without putting them through the hoops at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>A major job remains to be undertaken. The Minister has mentioned some of the work to be done in his opening remarks on Second Stage, but he must match these words with actions sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and compliment Deputy McGuinness on his thoughtful and positive speech. It is clear what he said was informed by his dealings with members of the immigrant community at different levels and with the organisations which seek to address their needs. The experience he describes is identical to mine in the cases I encounter every Saturday.</P>
      <P>I must begin by correcting the record with regard to yesterday&rsquo;s speech by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It included a paragraph which I suspect was not written by any public official or member of his Department. It stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I say this to underline one truth which has emerged about the matter in the meantime. The Labour Party, albeit after a tetchy internal debate in which Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s advice was narrowly rejected and Deputy Michael D. Higgins&rsquo;s views won out, decided to oppose this referendum.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There is not a scintilla of evidence for this. As I said, I suspect no official of his wrote this because it would be a disgrace to have done so without any basis in fact. I find it difficult to say but it is an invention and a pure fabrication. I must stay within the terms of this House but it is what would be described in other circumstances as a straightforward lie. It finds itself in print and I call on the Minister to either substantiate or withdraw it.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s national executive and parliamentary party in joint session discussed the attitude to the referendum at a meeting in the RDS. A consensus emerged at this meeting and no vote was taken, but this does not matter to the Minister, Deputy McDowell. It is interesting to contrast the thoughtful speech by Deputy McGuinness with the outrageous inability to listen of the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has responded to numerous <Col N="387"/>questions, not only with regard to this legislation but especially in the period before the referendum, with a type of smug indifference. I speak of that sneer which comes on the face of the privileged when they have to listen to arguments about rights, how they sit in smug composure, deaf to every argument, full of arrogance, and willing to trample over the truth, and in this case abuse it. The Minister has, in his opening speech, put a complete untruth on the record in which he asked for reason in the debate after claiming he was undemocratically shouted down when he suggested the referendum.</P>
      <P>I refer now to other aspects of his speech yesterday. Will he tell us the basis for the alleged crisis into which the Constitution was thrown by the birth of less than 250 babies in the Dublin maternity hospitals? How was the Constitution challenged by it? I accept the will of the people. I am a democrat. However, what we are deciding now and what we decide when we vote on this Bill, is the adequacy of the legislative response to the result of the referendum and the choice of people. We will judge the legislation by certain criteria.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister repeated in his speech what he said previously. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I do not need to spell out for Deputies in any great detail the background against which this Bill has evolved. Suffice to say that it is intended primarily to deal with the abuse of our citizenship code whereby persons with the most tenuous of links to Ireland [He is not talking about our tax exiles such as Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly or others of that ilk] have been arranging their affairs so as to have their child born in Ireland, even if they have no particular intention of staying here, and thereby securing EU rights of residence deriving from the child&rsquo;s Irish and EU citizenship.</P>
      <P FLI="0">How many people were we talking about? I respect those people in charge of our Dublin maternity hospitals, but they have had a long time to reflect on this. I wonder whether the Hippocratic oath, where doctors pledge themselves to the life of the child and the mother in such circumstances, requires them to come clean and say what they said to the Minister. The Minister stated that they implored him to do something. He went on to give the impression that they asked him for legislation and a constitutional change. They later denied this, but the harm had been done. The harm was not corrected by their silence.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state in his speech:</P>
      <P LI="1">In addition, our asylum system has been used by people who do not have a genuine need for protection under the Geneva Convention as a vehicle to gain entry into the State, in circumvention of normal immigration controls, for the very purpose of giving birth here and availing of what hitherto has been a universal entitle<Col N="388"/>ment to Irish citizenship derived from birth in Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Where are the figures to prove this? Different people floated figures, so to speak, to suggest that the proportion of people abusing the asylum system was such and such a figure. The Minister has responsibility for justice. If he makes such statements, he should quantify them. He should produce the figures.</P>
      <P>I have a question relating to the text of the Bill that we are discussing this afternoon. What is the position with regard to a pregnant asylum seeker who goes through a process whereby it is decided whether she is a legitimate asylum seeker? This process ends after the usual couple of years and she gets the response that she is a legitimate asylum seeker. In the meantime her baby has been born. What is the position of that baby with regard to citizenship under this legislation? Will the Minister turn his attention to that issue?</P>
      <P>The Minister continued his speech in his manner, known as the tradition of arrogance that the privileged sometimes inflict on democrats, to pour abuse on those who opposed the referendum. I hope he was not referring to me. For example, I made a mistake with regard to one aspect of the Nigerian constitution as amended, section 35, but I corrected it within 48 hours. My mistake was based on a case stated to me of a woman who had approached the Nigerian embassy and got a different answer. I accepted that the Nigerian constitution had been changed. However, if I had spoken in the radio programme that morning about &ldquo;a non-national woman&rdquo;, everything I said would have been absolutely correct.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about the position. Until this referendum, we had a position of <i>jus soli</i>, which although out of step with the other European countries, was shared by approximately 41 or 42 other countries. I accept my argument about <i>jus soli</i> has been defeated. However, let me not have to listen to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, seek to impute that those people on the other side of the argument are intellectually dishonest. I know what is intellectually dishonest. It is a Minister with responsibility for justice who puts a blatant untruth into the second page of his speech. That is dishonest, yet he has not got the courage to come into the House and withdraw his scurrilous allegation. I have noted, and not only on this matter, that he is the kind of man who wrestles with his Rolex while all around the country all sorts of issues of justice decompose before him. The people of this country have mostly, but not totally, disposed of that tradition, but he at least remains consistent to it.</P>
      <P>I now turn to some other aspects of this piecemeal legislation. I did not promise to have a complete and comprehensive immigration Bill, but the Minister did in 2001. However, during his speech, having moved on from a stated untruth, he stated that a working paper was being prepared. I apologise, I mean, a discussion paper. We <Col N="389"/>get a discussion paper after years of people in this House agreeing that we should draw a distinction between asylum seekers, economic migrants, those on work permits, relatives of these categories, people who wish to be reconciled with their families or people who simply wish to visit. We know the Minister&rsquo;s record is one where he has refused the rights of grandparents to visit their children, people who have spent their lives in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister presides over a Department where it is a kind of lottery to get through on the telephone. Deputy McGuinness was correct in his description of what occurs as we try to make sense of the situation in which we find ourselves. All the sneering in the world will not help. What we require of the Minister is justice, truth and respect for this House.</P>
      <P>I have some other specific questions on this legislation. How did the Minister arrive at the magic figure of three years? How did the three-year rule become established? I, for example, studied abroad in the Unites States and Britain. Many people have been invited here on fellowships and some are studying in the university where I taught, NUIG. The clock starts ticking for them when they finish their studies. Why does it start then, and not when a university legitimately accepts them? I am sure the eminent Minister will want to answer that question and provide the information.</P>
      <P>A question also arises with regard to the practice concerning relatives. We seem to believe it is perfectly all right to recruit nurses from all around the world, barely allow their partners in and then require they remain unemployed. When does the clock start ticking or end if these nurses have children? Perhaps the Minister wants to expound on the suggestion that three of their past four years have been in lawful residence in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Half my family lives outside Ireland, some of whom are married to people from north Africa and others to people from Asia. I remember being a young student in the Ireland of the 1950s at a time when many people emigrated. In 1959, just fewer than 60,000 people emigrated and in no year of the 1950s did fewer than 40,000 people leave Ireland. They went to a Britain where there was considerable anti-Irish feeling. Now, this Government, others and many different parties are anxious to do something about the descendants of our immigrants. The case we made at a time of emigration was on the basis of the basic rights of people. It did not relate solely to how many the economy could accommodate or to whether we had decided on a set period of years. We sought equal rights.</P>
      <P>This Minister has a curious difficulty with regard to rights and has frequently reflected this in his relationships with those working in the human rights area. There is nothing in the slightest way liberal about any of his attitudes to politics. He is an old 18th century conservative. He speaks, for example, from the most conservative <Col N="390"/>position on the constitutional source of rights. We have had this debate in the United States and elsewhere. It is at the root of whether to accept the sheer existence of international law. Such law assumes that one can have the basis of a right beyond the expressed constitution of a state and leans towards the suggestion that we might, in time, have universal rights.</P>
      <P>The aspiration and impetus of the United Nations is towards the idea that there are rights that we have as persons and by virtue of being alive. <i>Jus soli</i> is in that tradition. On the other hand, when one mitigates <i>jus soli</i> and puts conditionalities into it, an onus is placed upon one. The Minister has had a constitutional success. He created a bogus crisis which he has refused to quantify or to give figures for and has managed to introduce a measure by stealth, in a hurry and without consultation in advance with human rights organisations, North or South. He says he will consult them when he has got his way. That is the mark of the Minister&rsquo;s democracy.</P>
      <P>The treatment of unaccompanied minors is horrific. They are the most vulnerable of all. Many of them arrive in O&rsquo;Connell Street and are taken in by people who offer them shelter. I visited one place where 30 were living in two rooms. Some of them go to second level education but are blocked from going to third level, even if people are willing to pay for them, on the basis that they have reached 18 years and must lie there, so to speak, half dead in a legal sense. How can we accept that as a mark of a civilised state or as one with the most minimal regard for the law? These youngsters have survived in the most extreme circumstances. They manage to forage out some semblance of an education and are then blocked. This nonsense must stop. It is un-Irish and does not reflect the very best of us. It is ungenerous and wrong.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to use the layers of bureaucracy to drive families who are trying to survive, who have been made unemployed and many of whom are very ill to drag themselves through the process. I dealt with one case where I read the account of the appeal only two weeks ago. A woman had come from a country where the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe investigates allegations and it was suggested that because the OSCE had not reached a conclusion in the case, no suffering was involved. People have moved from one place to another are refused because they have inaccuracies relating to the place where they sought shelter. We decide, from a distance of thousands of miles, that people have made a mistake in their details. Would we like our own people to be subjected to that kind of process? This is accompanied by all the rhetoric of the happy, rich, cheerful self-confident Ireland that is bursting with wealth and which needs to be propagated throughout the world so that other backward countries can become like us. We should be ashamed of the way we treat migrants.</P>
      <P>How much money does the Minister&rsquo;s Department spend on anti-racism measures and what <Col N="391"/>groups benefit? Many of them say they do not have enough funds to keep going. What education programmes are taking place?</P>
      <P>The Bill is a slight one. It is does not deal with any of the substantive issues we might have anticipated, although the Minister has had a couple of years to prepare it. Admittedly matters move slowly and they must be careful in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, but we would by now have expected substantial legislation from the Minister dealing with the whole issue of immigration and citizenship.</P>
      <P>Citizenship is an interesting concept in terms of political theory from both the right and left. Obviously, one is not entitled to Irish citizenship if one pays taxes here because that would not include those who come home to rip off semi-State companies and then leave lest they acquire liability for taxes. The old conservative adage of paying one&rsquo;s taxes and becoming a citizen does not hold. Some citizens reside in Ireland for only three months in the year to avoid paying tax. Neither is it necessary in the Irish republic to confess to being some kind of republican because one can be given permission by the Cabinet to receive a title and then go down on one knee and get a clatter of a sword from Queen Elizabeth.</P>
      <P>The concept of citizenship is becoming unfashionable. In every place where citizenship has been developed, from the time of the French Revolution through the American constitution, it was associated with rights. Now there are hardly any rights. If this were a progressive republic one might assume one was a citizen by virtue that one was alive and a child and one would then be entitled to security, education, shelter and a house and to participate, communicate and so forth. That has gone. Most of those matters have been replaced by the suggestion that they must be purchased. This is the Minister&rsquo;s philosophy. That is why one needs, as he puts it, a good grain of inequality to give people an incentive to improve themselves. I am reminded of Richard Tawney&rsquo;s phrase about why poor people put up with their condition. He said it was because one day one of their number might, like a tadpole, sprout a jaw, leap to earth and become a frog. That is the Progressive Democrats philosophy. As the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, puts it, it is a case of helping those who are willing to help themselves. Meanwhile, citizenship does not apply to any aspect of universal rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wanted to remove the Traveller community as a distinctive ethnic group and he argued that case in Europe. In his relationship with his own Human Rights Commission and in respect of disability, the Minister eschews every philosophical principle of rights and demonstrates his deep, dangerous, old, deadly conservatism. That is the frame of mind which led him to invent a crisis and a moral panic and to hold a referendum. I accept what the people decided but I am not required to say it was anything other than <Col N="392"/>a bad day. It was a bad day in the way the matter was rushed and argued and it did not help Ireland as it looks forward to a pluralist or multicultural future.</P>
      <P>Those people who exploit the politics of fear will themselves suffer. We see this in many aspects of our society. In Mrs. Thatcher&rsquo;s Britain where the politics of fear came to its most developed point, the companies which expanded most were security firms. One sees gated communities where people can electronically close out those who are coming down the road to get what they have. Unfortunately, many of them are presumed not to be the same colour as ourselves. That is the thinking of the politics of fear.</P>
      <P>Our economy depends on migrant workers and we should treat them better than we ever wanted our own people abroad to be treated. I know that people come to Ireland who have simply fled from hopeless situations. We need adequate and comprehensive legislation which will deal with immigration and citizenship, remove any kind of absolute authority from the employer, give speedy recognition of international conventions on asylum and treat economic migrants humanely.</P>
      <P>If the Government wants to start off with a clean slate, it should grant an amnesty to all those who have become clogged up in the system. If for no other reason, this should be done in recognition of the fact that many asylum seekers have made close connections with this State and their children are attending school here.</P>
      <P>The courts will decide whether those who came here under an existing legal process can have that arbitrarily changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Moloney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>While I hesitate to say so, I think the last speaker is wrong in his understanding of natural law in the Constitution. He is implying that there are imprescriptible and inalienable rights in the Constitution that pre-exist that document&rsquo;s creation. The phraseology exists in Article 41.1.1&deg; which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Recent case law, however, has indicated that that is not so. A case that comes to mind involved a parent who chose to deny his or her child access to a form of inoculation. The health board then made an application to put the child into care for its own protection. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled that unless there was an immediate risk to the child the health board was not entitled to interfere with the parent&rsquo;s inalienable right to <Col N="393"/>decide, as a family, what it should do concerning the child. The implication was that if there is an immediate risk the State has a right to legislate, for example, to protect the child over and above the so-called inalienable rights of a parent.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to put this point but as far as I understand it there are no such things as laws antecedent to human intervention, to put it artlessly like that. I will give way to the Deputy if I have misunderstood his remarks in this regard. As far as I understand it, natural law supposedly exists prior to any constitution being created. It has been shown in case law and the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted that all such types of law as described in the Constitution are subject in certain cases to limitations created either by legislation or constitutional change. The arguments the Deputy has made in criticising the current Minister do not hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My argument was that it concerned pre-rights. I was really arguing for an evolving universal right. I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about arguing from the Constitution, which was not my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the Deputy&rsquo;s point generally, rather than specifically. I wanted to make that point because it is an interesting area for the Constitution. As regards the Bill before us, when this matter came before the House in the form of the referendum last April, I made my views known at that time and said I was unhappy with the manner in which the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and also the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party had not been kept informed of the proposals during the short time that was allocated prior to the referendum. However, I supported the referendum because I acknowledged that there were abuses within the system concerning asylum applications. The Minister made a commitment at that time in which he said that legislation would be prepared on citizenship and, later, on immigration. He invited comments from interested parties, in particularly from the Human Rights Commission here. He made those comments knowing that he would be held to them. The people decided to support the referendum with 80% voting in favour and 20% against. Since then the Minister has begun the process of dealing with the issues, as promised. It was clear at the time that some changes were taking place as regards the number of people making asylum applications.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the immigration issue, also. Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to delays, particularly with regard to work permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>He identified the principal cause as being Government indolence and the failure to bring forward legislation, but a number of other <Col N="394"/>reasons are worth considering. Our economy has undergone great change in recent times, which has made Ireland attractive to economic migrants and, also, we need migrant labour. That is one of the reasons for this system.</P>
      <P>In addition, European Union rules on immigration have not evolved in recent years. The agreement reached at Tampere five years ago envisaged a common asylum and immigration policy, along with common border patrols. Since then, however, no progress has been made, which is lamented in the EU. The reasons for that delay are multiple and cannot be laid at the door of any group or individual. One of the criticisms is the absence of qualified majority voting in the areas of freedom, security and justice. I note that in the coming months the European Council will discuss a multi-annual agenda for that area. If that takes place, we will finally have an EU framework allowing each member state to proceed with a comprehensive and coherent policy that will apply across the Union. Currently, however, we are fumbling from judgments by the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice, to a set of circumstances that changes the way we must consider these issues. Until we have a coherent EU policy we will continue in that vein. In acknowledging that point, we must examine the evidence. The British Home Secretary, Mr. David Blunkett, is refusing to agree to border patrols that are sought by the French and Germans, although the Italians and Spanish do not want them. These core divisions that exist within EU member states will continue so, in that sense, we will have to make our own immigration policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGuinness described the work permit problem that all Members of the House have experienced in their daily work. The application process is slow and nobody supports the notion of employers having rights over work permits. It strikes me as being similar to the work permit system that operated under the apartheid regime in South Africa, which was quite unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Bonded labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The current situation is not entirely the fault of the Government. There is a failure on the part of EU member states to come up with a common immigration policy. Until they do, it will be difficult for the Government to deal comprehensively with this matter. It is unfortunate that applications for visitor visas for spouses and other relatives are being processed so slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Simple family ceremonies such as the celebration of marriage, birth or confirmation cannot be attended by the family of the immigrant working here because of the extremely slow nature of the work permit and visitor visa application system. Every Member of the House will have come across the case of a Filipina nurse who wished to celebrate an event with her family. <Col N="395"/>She found herself running into the sands of bureaucracy, unable to proceed with the celebration.</P>
      <P>In future the EU should consider a very straightforward points-based economic migration system. When I left college in 1988 Australia had a points-based system whereby that country put a premium on certain qualifications, for example carpentry or bricklaying. The system was straightforward and applications were processed quickly. Those people the country wanted were accepted and it was a very fair system.</P>
      <P>On the naturalisation provisions, the Minister has included a very important provision allowing for the possibility of conferring citizenship on a minor born in the State. This amendment is an important development. Naturally as a result of the recent Chen decision this confers rights on parents also. In that case the European Court of Justice determined that children&rsquo;s rights were meaningless unless parents had similar or equal rights. If minors born in the State are to have a right of naturalisation under this new section, naturally the parents under the ECJ interpretation will also have rights.</P>
      <P>I have one bugbear, which bothers me considerably, concerning the citizenship ceremony. Nothing can be done about this in legislation; it is a very straightforward system of regulation. In Dublin the citizenship ceremony takes place in the District Court; outside Dublin it may happen in other places. The new citizens are shuffled around corridors in a very perfunctory way and are granted citizenship. They make a declaration and very often the language is beyond them. They do not quite understand what is going on and they are shuffled back out on the streets again.</P>
      <P>Anybody granted citizenship should be given a proper ceremony and should be entitled to a big day out. I do not see why this could not happen in the Four Courts with a Supreme Court Judge taking an hour from 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. The new citizens should be given a cup of tea and have their photographs taken to record what I consider to be a huge honour. The present process is dreadfully inadequate. However, these points do not reflect on the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>While I have often criticised draftsmen, in this case we have been given a consolidated form of what will be the new Act if the Bill is passed. With these types of Bills it is very helpful for the draftsmen to provide such a document to legislators to allow us to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Andrews for allowing me to share time. While I welcome the Bill, I also see the shortcomings within the system. I go along with much of what the previous speaker and Deputy McGuinness have said. I recognise the genuine points made by Deputy Michael Higgins and we should consider granting an amnesty. While I am not sure of the implications, I do not rubbish the suggestion and it <Col N="396"/>should be examined due to the shortcomings of the system up to now.</P>
      <P>I come from a rural constituency, which heretofore did not have to deal with the difficulties of trying to resolve problems involving immigration, work permits etc. As a rural Deputy in my weekly clinics I see the huge difficulties of people on the one hand trying to secure permanent residency and work in the State while at the same time feeling officials are not interested in dealing with their applications. I would welcome the introduction of legislation to clarify our immigration policy. While the Bill goes some way towards that I would like to see more specifics addressed.</P>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker in saying that the citizenship ceremony should not be carried out in a back room. It should be quite public and we should recognise the huge advantages citizenship confers on people.</P>
      <P>As with other Deputies I have seen the rumour machine in operation whereby the local population can be turned against foreign nationals on the basis that they will take the best jobs, houses etc. While I do not want to use the word &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;, all of this adds to the feeling of dislike that can occur in local communities based on completely inaccurate information. I would welcome a constructive debate on legislation consolidating the advantages and entitlements of foreign nationals coming to live in the State. Many public meetings have portrayed total misconceptions relating to asylum seekers, economic migrants, foreign nationals, refugees etc. All the issues are brought back to one. I have often heard it said that these people are here purely to scrounge from the State. It is important for the Government to clarify the entitlements and to clearly show that such people are not conferred with greater entitlements than the local population.</P>
      <P>As I often heard queries during the referendum campaign, I emphasise what this Bill is not about. It will not affect the constitutional rights to Irish citizenship of any child born North or South to at least one Irish parent. This was lost during the referendum. As people were so confused about this matter, it needs to be revisited and clarified. The Bill is not about removing Irish citizenship from anybody who had or was entitled to it before the passing of the amendment. While party spokespeople tried to clarify such matters, these two important matters were not brought home.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not prevent those who do not acquire citizenship at birth from acquiring it at a later stage after a number of years&rsquo; residency in the State. The Bill does not affect the Good Friday Agreement. It does not affect those children born without nationality &mdash; no one born in Ireland can end up without a nationality at present and this will continue to be the case. In addition to supporting the Bill we need to do more and not just by way of a public relations exercise. If we are to allow our new found friends from abroad to settle down, it is incumbent on us <Col N="397"/>as public representatives to clarify these matters locally.</P>
      <P>I welcome newcomers to my hometown &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; as well as those who have come to the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly in general. I pay tribute to their economic, cultural and social contribution to the community. I am not saying this simply to have something to say in my ten-minute time slot. I have recognised and seen within a short space of time the huge cultural contribution made locally and particularly in the midlands.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the Constitution to close the loophole in our citizenship law that is open to abuse, as has been recognised. The amendment to the Constitution brings Ireland into line with citizenship norms in other European countries. During the referendum campaign, it was often stated that we were acting over and above those EU norms when the opposite was the case. I also see the need for further clarification.</P>
      <P>Some people have qualifications from their home countries, which they have been unable to utilise in the State to date. Over the weekend I will meet someone currently working as a barman in a town in my constituency, whose previous career was as an air traffic controller abroad. To set the public mind at ease about the huge contribution foreign nationals can make on the State, it is incumbent on us to move immediately on this matter.</P>
      <P>We may be inclined to blame the EU and say that EU immigration policies are not up to scratch and should be brought up to date, which I can understand. However, it is very difficult to try to deal with the Department when dealing with new constituents who wish to meet for family celebrations, as Deputy Andrews suggested, since there is great difficulty attached to this process.</P>
      <P>The system for the granting of work permits should also be examined. I recognise the need for the Government and the State to put in place practices that will protect the citizens of Ireland and ensure entitlements for new found citizens but it is also important that we put across the message that those applying for work permits and immigration status are welcome. People seeking work permits are up against it because the system is slow and gives the wrong image. We must be proactive in recognising that.</P>
      <P>The economy has expanded and we are seeking immigrant workers. We must seize this opportunity by showing that we want support for the economy and welcome foreign nationals. We do not want to give the impression we are slowing the process down or being selective, something I would oppose. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my serious objections to this legislation which has at its core a disrespect for basic human rights and equality. The right of every child to citizenship based on birth is a fundamental principle that has been used by <Col N="398"/>many of our own emigrants to help them start new lives in far-flung corners of the world. How hypocritical of us to expect the United States of America to grant an amnesty to Irish emigrants and make use of the right of citizenship granted to children of Irish parents, while refusing the same right to children born on this island. Do we have the right to deny these Irish citizen children their homeland? The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Immigrant Council of Ireland have raised important human rights considerations that have yet to be and must be addressed before this Bill should proceed.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of some of those issues. The Government is obliged, under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration when introducing any legislation that might impact on the rights and interests of the child, including those that are not directly concerned with children but indirectly affect them, such as decisions regarding the status of their parents. Citizenship legislation clearly falls within those parameters. Has there been any consultation with the Ombudsman for Children or any of the children representative organisations? Has there been any research on the potential impact of this legislation on particular groups of children?</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that Ireland is a signatory to the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. The Government has a duty to ensure and demonstrate that any legislative initiative does not impact on any individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction in a discriminatory way and to guarantee the protection of rights at all levels, irrespective of national, ethnic or social origins, birth or other status.</P>
      <P>Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for family and private life. Ireland has signed up to take measures to prevent racism and promote better relations between different racial and ethnic groups in Irish society by ratifying the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 2 states that each state party shall take effective measures to review, to amend and rescind or nullify any laws and regulations that may have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination. There is deep concern about the present state of race relations in Ireland, particularly prior to and immediately after the constitutional referendum. While recognising the democratic decision of the people, there is no doubt in my mind that the Government&rsquo;s campaign of scapegoating and playing on the fears of people about floods of immigrants and bogus asylum seekers only served to alienate people further and institutionalise discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>What has not been said, and should be admitted, is that we need immigrants, people with a broad range of skills, consumers and tax<Col N="399"/>payers, who will contribute to the economy of the State. It has been proven time and again that immigration is necessary if society and the economy is to prosper.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the issue of Irish citizen children born in the State to non-nationals who still face deportation. They are part of the new generation of Irish citizens who have a fundamental right to their nation of birth and to the protection and care of their parents. I call on the Minister to act promptly and regularise properly the status of non-nationals who have been living in fear and anxiety while facing deportation. Also, any deportation orders that may have been issued to these families should be rescinded. It is unacceptable that the Government has accelerated the deportation of Irish children and is sending them into exile from the nation of their birth.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a truly fair and transparent asylum and immigration system, the State has fallen back on anti-immigration reflexes. Restrictive immigration control is not the answer to the many problems facing our society. We now have a unique opportunity to build a progressive policy on immigration and citizenship, with due respect for the rights of everyone on the island and to the benefit of society. This Bill, however, is discriminatory and anti-democratic legislation that flies in the face of nearly every human rights instrument Ireland is committed to upholding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did not say that in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important legislation. While I welcome the debate in the House, I abhor the background to it. I opposed the referendum and canvassed against it. I am proud to say that I was one of the 20% that voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I hope that we can respect the democratic rights of the dissenting voice, just as I accept the democratic will expressed in the referendum. Its result does not mean that I cannot express a different view.</P>
      <P>When dealing with the Bill, it is not an option to treat babies in a different way because of their skin colour or cultural background. Equality begins the day a child is born and that is why I am concerned by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I strongly supported the views expressed by Mr. Bruce Morrison when he commented on this issue and offered his opinion of our current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister&rsquo;s bungling of the issue and the way he has dealt with particular cases has been a disgrace and he should resign. Mr. Morrison is a man of integrity and vision and a former United States Congressman who secured 48,000 diversity visas for Irish people living illegally in the United States in the 1980s. He condemned the Government&rsquo;s proposed citizenship referendum and called it dangerous. He also described the asylum and immigration system as hopelessly inefficient. He said there is so much work to be done to bring <Col N="400"/>together a coherent immigration policy in Ireland rather than jump into a referendum. He said voters were being asked to tighten up citizenship laws even though the existing regulations dealt with many of the situations. He also said that to ask them to decide in a vacuum with inadequate enforcement of existing laws is to invite them to exercise their worst instincts about newcomers rather than their best. That was what he thought was dangerous about the referendum.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This warning from the former Congressman who, in the past, has been a very influential friend of Ireland on Capitol Hill came as an embarrassment to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Many of the 48,000 who qualified for the Morrison visas eventually secured United States citizenship. This was a very important step for us, particularly in the 1980s when many of our friends lived in the United States illegally because of low pay, the downturn in the economy and mass unemployment here. Immigrants are attracted to our island because of our success and we should be open and welcoming. That is the progressive way forward.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for amendment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2001 consequent on the coming into effect of the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act 2004. The Bill also includes an amendment to those Acts designed to exclude the future possibility of the reintroduction of a scheme of investment based naturalisation. The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act inserted a new provision into the Constitution at Article 9 which provides that notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a person born on the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have at the time of his or her birth at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality unless otherwise provided by the law. The effect of this amendment is to qualify Article 2 of the Constitution which provides that it is the entitlement and birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>Relevant also is the Good Friday Agreement and Article 1.6 where the two Governments recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose. It accordingly confirms that the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be effected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland. These are the core issues in the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, we must also face up to the broader issue and the reality of the debate at the time of the referendum.  I remember being hammered on many doorsteps because I was advocating a No vote. I totally accepted that but the reasons given were very sad. There were elements of racism in <Col N="401"/>many of the comments made to me. All too often false stories are used to spread prejudices.  They are sometimes called urban myths when they occur in the city, although they are equally common in the countryside. They lack any basis in hard evidence and their source is usually summed up in the old Irish saying, d&uacute;irt duine liom go nd&uacute;irt duine leis, a person said to me that a person said to him or her, in other words, these stories survive and thrive on hearsay.    </P>
      <P>We, as legislators, must give leadership on this issue. It is essential we deal with the important facts &mdash; for example, the comments about migrant workers, asylum seekers and refugees. Migrant workers have permission to live and work in Ireland. Their legal status varies according to their place of origin or the type and duration of their permit, visa or work authorisation. An asylum seeker is the legal status of anyone who applies for the protection of the State through the asylum process. Under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, a refugee &mdash; as defined in the Refugee Act of 1996, the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; refers to the legal status of anyone who has completed the asylum process &mdash; is given the protection of the State and can live, work and remain in the State as a refugee with similar rights to an Irish citizen. The myths about such people are amazing. It is important we as legislators show leadership.</P>
      <P>In the past two days, two Iraqi citizens were discovered hiding in a container in Wexford port. They were trying to escape from a major international conflict. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will look after these people and ensure they are protected. There is a Kurdish family living in my constituency which has been given refugee status. The rest of the family is stuck in a refugee camp in Iraq and they want to be reunited, yet in the past week the Minister turned down my attempt to reunite the family. It is not acceptable that a family should live with the threat of violence and in a refugee camp given the way Kurds are treated. Any Minister, or Department, who does not have an open mind and heart should hang his or her head in shame. As an emigrant country, it is important people wake up to this reality.</P>
      <P>We have responsibilities under United Nations and human rights laws. I will not accept that Kurds, constituents of mine in Dublin North-Central, who have started a life, are working here and are making a major contribution cannot be reunited with the rest of their family. Their family could be at severe risk but we come up with wishy-washy reasons for not accepting them. I point this out as another example of the cold-heartedness of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue.</P>
      <P>Racism is a reality in this country. It is not as bad in the South as it is in parts of the North where there are five racist attacks per week. Like sectarianism, we cannot allow it to raise its head; we must nip it in the bud. The sad reality is that during the referendum campaign racist comments <Col N="402"/>were made to politicians. Everyone in the House knows that and they should not say racism was not evident during the referendum campaign. I can name 20 Members of this House to whom racist comments were made. We must stand up and show leadership. I will not accept racism or sectarianism in Irish society.</P>
      <P>I strongly agree with some of the comments of Deputy Ferris on human rights and respect for people. I remind people that this is an emigrant nation. Half of our cousins are in Australia, America, England, New Zealand and elsewhere. Many of us remember when we were younger and things were bad, money was sent home from these countries. We should not walk away from our responsibilities now that this is a very progressive and wealthy nation.</P>
      <P>I also accept we must make sure we look after our own. This morning we debated disadvantaged communities throughout the State which are neglected. We have a dual responsibility and a duty to challenge the myths propagated by Members of this House, some of whom have gone on to higher office. I will not get into that because I had that row two years ago with a colleague in my constituency, but when it comes to leadership on this issue, people on the Opposition benches will not sit on the fence. Even if it is not trendy or safe politically, we will go with it and take the risks because it is a serious issue and we must stand up and be counted.</P>
      <P>It has been said the country is flooded with asylum seekers. If one looks at the figures, they represent a relatively small proportion of total inward migration. For example, between 1995 and 2000, half of the new arrivals were returning Irish emigrants. Some 50,000, or perhaps more, people have been issued with work permits. There are approximately 7,900 asylum seekers. One would not even get 7,000 people into Tolka Park tomorrow night when Shelbourne play Cork City. Those are the numbers about which we are talking. Let us delete the word &ldquo;flooded&rdquo; from our vocabulary.</P>
      <P>There is also the myth about asylum seekers getting money for cars, mobile telephones and drink. They get full board and accommodation while their applications are being processed and, in other circumstances, only those social welfare entitlements available to Irish people. That circumstances are otherwise is another myth which should be buried. A common contention we all hear is that asylum seekers do not want to work whereas in truth they are barred from working while their cases are being examined. Many asylum seekers work voluntarily in the community and run projects. A famous contention of tabloid journalists and the media in general involves bogus asylum seekers. While a minority of asylum seekers are found to be ineligible under the Geneva Convention, this contention ignores that most people are forced to leave home due to dire economic, political and social circumstances. Some of our own are in the same circumstances in the United States of America and would be <Col N="403"/>deported if discovered. It is important to take these issues on board when addressing immigration and citizenship in the House.</P>
      <P>I had the honour and privilege to work in a small north inner-city school for 20 years among the pupils of which were representatives of seven nationalities. Different colours and creeds were not issues in the lives of the four year olds in junior infant classes but they were for some adults. The baggage began with the adults while the children had no problems. It was a privilege and an honour to see children from four or five different nationalities playing together on an under-13 GAA team in the Cumann na mBunscoil league. It showed that respect for diversity and different cultures was the progressive way forward.</P>
      <P>Sadly, the referendum campaign denied us the opportunity to have a broader discussion of the issues. While we must have immigration policies and a country must defend its integrity, one does not simply close the borders. There is an element within the EU about which I am very concerned in this regard. I urge Ministers to nip in the bud and take on right-wing elements as they emerge in Germany, France and other member states. There can be no compromise with such people. Racism, like sectarianism, can never be an option. While I welcome the opportunity presented to record my views, I will vote against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak on this important Bill. The will of the people as voiced in the referendum must be accepted. Last summer, Fine Gael decided to support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote with reservations which centred on the way in which the referendum was being handled by the Government, especially the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. Given its potential to be abused, citizenship law is a sensitive matter. I am convinced that had the Minister referred the matter to an all-party committee, substantial cross-party support could have been achieved. The debate which was held was very divisive and everybody had a different interpretation of what was involved. Instead of embarking on a process which provided time for cross-party debate, the Minister deliberately set in train a course of action designed to create friction in the Oireachtas and generate divisions among parties. The manner in which the matter was analysed in the media reflected that approach. There was a lack of clarity.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the proposal in the Oireachtas, Fine Gael adopted a responsible, constructive approach. The party opposed the timing of the referendum and questioned the Minister on the need to hold it. Despite the exploration by Fine Gael of a number of realistic alternatives, the Minister decided he knew best and today we find ourselves debating legislation to give effect to the referendum decision. My party accepts the will of the people.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which we require a clear policy. The enlargement of the EU to 25 member <Col N="404"/>states was a positive development. From my experience in business, I know of the difficulty of clearing work permits through Davitt House. A significant number of employers have had to wait up to 14 weeks to obtain a simple permit, a problem which has been alleviated by the granting of the right of free movement to a large number of people who wish to work in the State. There has been a lack of coherent policy at a time when an unprecedented number of non-nationals have come to our shores. The economic upturn coupled with labour shortages and the entry of new EU member states attracted foreign workers to the State. Irish people have such high employment expectations now that they do not want to work in the services industry. It is a serious problem going forward in the context of the provision of the traditional c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte in the retail trade, restaurants and hotels. For many, work in these areas is a temporary arrangement often taken on by student workers. This has opened up a significant opportunity for many nationals of EU accession states.</P>
      <P>Despite the influx of non-nationals, the Government continues to fail to face up to the issue and produce an immigration policy. Duplication is widespread and diverse aspects of immigration are dealt with by several Departments. I am amazed the Minister has failed to provide a one-stop shop. Refugees and asylum seekers are dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, work permits by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and visas by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Residency and citizenship are dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform while registration is a function of the Garda. It would be a joke if one were to run a business in this manner. It would make a great deal more sense if one body were to deal with all of these aspects of immigration. Immigrants and employers find themselves going from the Garda authorities to the Department of Foreign Affairs and elsewhere as it is difficult to know to which body one must turn.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the significant cost of duplication while the matter of the payment of substantial sums to provide accommodation for refugees has been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts. A new policy has been implemented whereby asylum seekers are to be accommodated in one of several national centres. A facility has been bought in Sligo which will house up to 200 people who previously received rent subsidies. It does not seem to be a compassionate alternative to house up to 200 people in a form of sheltered accommodation and it is one on which I seek clarification. Perhaps the policy has merits, but it seems very restrictive to accommodate people in a type of boarding school facility while providing them with very little money. The ability of refugees to become involved in communities has been curbed and they are not allowed to work. Whereas the ability to work could be therapeutic, the housing of 200 <Col N="405"/>people in a small area in the hope that they will integrate with a community will be problematic.</P>
      <P>At least three Departments and a great many agencies handle what could be shaped into a unified process. I call on the Government to give responsibility for all immigrant affairs to one Department. It is amazing that structures cannot be streamlined. A great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money was wasted when local authorities and the Office of Public Works failed to agree on planning permission for properties intended to provide accommodation for asylum seekers. I am aware of a particular property on which &euro;12 million was spent and on which a subsequent application for change of use was refused. That type of bad planning is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Government is to be complimented on providing that people from the 25 EU member countries can come to Ireland to work. That derogation is to be welcomed as it reduces pressure in terms of work permits. It is equally important that the many talented refugees in this country are allowed to contribute by way of temporary work visa if an employer is prepared to sponsor them. There is no reason not to regularise the status of the estimated 11,000 non-EU parents of Irish children who applied for residency based on the birth of a child here before the Supreme Court decision in January 2003. There can be no precedent set by regularising these people. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should do the decent thing given the uncertainty surrounding the lives of these people. The Minister has been vocal on many issues. The regularising of these people is important in terms of a child&rsquo;s stability and, in particular, in terms of his or her education, and it is equally important from the point of view of parental responsibilities and their job entitlements.</P>
      <P>The Chen case which provides that an Irish-born child has the right of residency in any EU country except Ireland is absurd. I ask the Minister to clarify how the situation in Ireland will be affected following the European Court of Justice ruling that a mother of a baby born in Northern Ireland has the right to remain in the UK on the basis that her baby is an Irish-EU citizen. It is important to the 11,000 non-EU citizens that this matter is sorted out.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Supreme Court decision it was accepted practice that parents of children born within this State were granted residency on that basis. I understand the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had established a separate procedure for dealing with such applications. Many statutory agencies and lawyers have advised non-national parents and a number of asylum seekers not to rely on their status as parents of Irish born children. Many asylum seekers and other non-nationals have made decisions about their future based on the advice they received and their understanding of the position before the Supreme Court decision in the L&amp;O case.</P><Col N="406"/>
      <P>This is important legislation and it has been well debated. I listened to what Deputy Michael D. Higgins had to say on the difficulties encountered to date. Ireland is perceived as a friendly nation and Irish people living in places such as the United States, many of whom are there on a temporary basis, receive a welcome reception. However, I am aware of many people who were deported from the United States over night. Deputy Higgins referred to the situation which pertains when people apply to have the grandparents of their child come to visit them. These people, who were medical practitioners in their country of origin, had valid documentation which supported their intention to return home, yet they were refused entry. It is important to take people at their word and to have integrity in the process. It is disappointing the Minister will not grant a holiday visa to people with valid documentation, supported by employers, who intend to return to their countries of origin and have the financial means to support themselves while in the country.</P>
      <P>In this context, we should note the number of people who emigrated in the past 150 years. Some 50 million people in the United States claim to be part of the Irish diaspora. We must consider the recognition and support they receive all over the world. It is important to be compassionate. I do not suggest the legislation is void of sentiment but one must be tolerant of refugees. However, I am sure this problem will be resolved. The T&aacute;naiste during her time in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment ensured people from an enlarged Europe were able to come here to work. That is good for the business community. The procedure of applying for work visas was expensive, time consuming and froth with difficulty. It is time to take an integrated approach to this matter and place it within the remit of one Department rather than four or five. It is regrettable the Government, in all its wisdom, has dedicated four bodies to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>The passports for sale issue was most regrettable. It was embarrassing that people could automatically become citizens of Ireland based on their financial means. That was bad politics and should never have happened. It is an issue that should be investigated further because it clearly indicated that a two-tier system operated whereby those who had the contacts and financial means could be put in such a privileged position. This legislation will ensure there will be no attempt by future Governments to provide further incentives in that regard. People will become Irish citizens only through legitimate means as set out in the Bill. This issue has been contentious for many years. Our reputation, in terms of tourism, as a friendly nation &mdash; the Irish diaspora throughout the world have been recognised for their friendliness &mdash; has been damaged by the manner in which the State dealt with this matter and the Minister&rsquo;s lack of compassion in dealing with families and the next-of-kin of people legally entitled to be here.</P><Col N="407"/>
      <P>We are a multicultural society and the draconian way in which the Minister is dealing with this issue is regrettable. It is important he clearly understands that those visiting people legally entitled to be in the State will comply with the terms of their travel visas. There are procedures in place to deal with those who do not comply. The Minister should not categorise people and take decisions which prevent elderly people from visiting their grandchildren in bona fide cases. Such people would be an asset to this State because those who remain here for a couple of weeks will spend money and that, in turn, will benefit small business and the economy. It is important there is compassion in terms of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Murphy on putting the Fine Gael position on this legislation.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if her Department has deferred until 2007 or 2008 making a major investment in the non-acute sector, especially the primary care sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26414/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not correct to say that funding for the non-acute sector, including primary care has been deferred to 2007 or 2008. The total capital programme for this year is &euro;509 million. The health capital investment framework programme for the years 2004 to 2008 proposes a total capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion. This includes capital investment in the non-acute hospital sector.</P>
        <P>A number of major acute hospital projects are under way which by their nature involve significant contractual funding commitments &mdash; construction, fees, equipping &mdash; for the next few years. It is in this context, allied to the multi-annual nature of the funding programme, that a greater emphasis is being placed on the non-acute programme for the latter period of the framework. This is especially the case, bearing in mind existing contractual commitments and the timescales involved in delivering the larger projects in the non-acute sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no funding for primary care in the Government&rsquo;s primary care strategy to which the Minister has made no reference. While this is not what makes headline news, investment in primary care, which includes general practice services and ambulance services, is a solution to the long-term crisis in health. Will the <Col N="408"/>T&aacute;naiste agree that if there is no investment in primary care, it makes the Hanly report unimplementable? The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated before leaving office a month ago, that none of the &euro;2.5 million which is being rolled out was to be invested in the non-acute hospital sector, specifically the primary care sector. In information released under the Freedom of Information Act, the Department of Health and Children said there will be no investment in primary care until 2007. Without investment in primary care, the Hanly report, as published by the Department, is unimplementable. In regard to the consultants&rsquo; contract, there is no point in negotiating it unless there is major investment in primary care. The Minister has not stated where the investment in primary care is going.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy. The development of the primary care sector is central to the health strategy. Certainly the general practitioner service is the first port of call for the majority of people. I am examining how we can develop further the potential the primary care sector offers. I said in my reply that it is not correct to say that the non-acute sector will not receive substantial funding. I have a number of projects to which I can refer but I do not wish to delay the House. Among them are projects in the mental health area which are a priority for the Government. They include the facilities of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum which are not appropriate to the needs of today. I intend to bring forward proposals to the Cabinet shortly on that matter. It would be my intention to dispose of some of the substantial land assets available in the health sector and to use them as additional funding on the capital side for many of the projects, such as those in primary care, which the Deputy mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that funding will be put into mental health services. However, I am asking specifically about primary care to which no commitment has been given in the primary care strategy. Prior to leaving office, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, began to speak about public private partnerships which were not referred to when the primary care strategy was published. It appears that funding in this area has come to a stop. That is the point I make because it is the solution to many of the crises in the health service. I am surprised that investment in primary care should be stopped when there is already a manpower crisis and the hospitals with the worse accident and emergency crises are those which also have the poorest primary care services. While investment in this area does not make headline news, it is vital for the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I emphasise there is no question of investment in the primary care sector being dropped. Regarding the next two questions I will <Col N="409"/>take, developing out-of-hours services in the greater Dublin area is crucial to relieving many of the pressures experienced by the accident and emergency departments in the Dublin area. Primary care is developed along a number of models. I look forward to the negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and consultants on the changes which are necessary to implement the reform programme which the Government has under way to unsure this country has the best possible standard of health care delivery in the world. I want people to be able to come to Ireland in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
        <P>This Government has over recent years introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving the delivery of acute services and alleviating the pressures on accident and emergency departments. Improved and expanded accident and emergency departments are being provided. Recently, new departments have been provided at Cork University Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Naas General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, and Clonmel and Roscommon general hospitals.</P>
        <P>Following a submission from the Eastern Regional Health Authority in June 2004 my predecessor approved proposals for short and <Col N="410"/>medium-term action to be taken to address the problems associated with emergency departments in the Dublin academic teaching hospitals. The cost of these new initiatives is &euro;2.4 million in a full year and includes the appointment of specialist nurses, the establishment of rapid assessment teams, a clinical decisions unit and the provision of multidisciplinary teams to assess patients.</P>
        <P>An additional 29 emergency medicine consultant posts were approved under the winter initiative 2000-2001. There are now 51 emergency medicine consultant posts in acute hospitals which is a 260% increase since 1997. The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision making, enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.</P>
        <P>Pressures on the hospital system, especially in the eastern region, arise from demands on emergency departments and on difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. Funding of &euro;16.8 million has been made available to the ERHA which has resulted in some 520 patients being discharged and work is continuing to facilitate the discharge of a further 80 patients.</P>
        <P>Planning for the discharge of patients by acute hospitals and the liaison with the community services has been prioritised on an ongoing basis by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Initiatives such as Homefirst, Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and home subvention all contribute to providing alternative care packages for older people so that they can be discharged. Increasing acute bed capacity will also have an impact on the delivery of emergency services.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the initiatives introduced over a period of years, there remain too many difficulties and delays in accident and emergency departments which I have already said are not acceptable. They are, however, a symptom of the underlining problem in the health care system. In dealing with the difficulties being experienced by patients, it is therefore necessary to take an holistic approach.</P>
        <P>The effective delivery of emergency services cannot be done in isolation of all hospital services. Resolving the problems is a priority of mine. I am identifying the particular pressure points within the health system that effect the efficient delivery of emergency services. I intend to ensure the most pressing problems are addressed as a matter of urgency and in the context of the upcoming Estimates. I intend to introduce a wide-ranging package of measures that will address the problems to which I have referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept that her reply is deeply disappointing? So far all she has had to offer is rhetoric and the repeat of measures taken in the past which have not worked. Is she genuinely not aware of the extent of the crisis in our accident and emergency departments where on a night people can occupy <Col N="411"/>100 or 200 trolleys because they cannot access a bed? Would she like to state to the House what she will do about this crisis considering that the winter has not come yet and we are in such difficulties and the elderly are suffering severely? Will the T&aacute;naiste tell the truth about the number of acute inpatient beds that have been provided by the Government since the health strategy was published? The figure given by the Taoiseach was 900 but it turns out that was 583, which actually means just 299 inpatient beds have been provided since 2001. Does the T&aacute;naiste think this is satisfactory and will she tell the truth so that we can at least know what we are talking about?</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste use the private nursing home capacity? Will she introduce MAUs to Dublin hospitals? Will she extend medical cards to encourage access to primary care? Will she guarantee that there will be no closure or downgrading of any accident and emergency department as planned on foot of the Hanly report in order to ensure no further pressure is place on over-stretched services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>During those seven years I have been well aware of the substantial funding that has been given to the health services. There has been a threefold increase in funding in that period. If money alone could solve the problem, we would not have one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I tell the truth. I will not tell lies and I will not play politics with patients. Among the measures that will be introduced are some of the matters mentioned by the Deputy and they will be addressed in the context of the Estimates, having considered the issues and spoken to those <Col N="412"/>involved in delivering the services. It will not be a top-of-the-head, impatient response. Rather, it will be one that will work to change the experience of patients in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Annually, 1.2 million people attend accident and emergency facilities in Ireland, which is more than a quarter of the population, many of whom are on repeat visits. This is a huge volume of activity. Therefore, we must ensure that the experience of those who are required to attend accident and emergency departments is a positive one and that the service is run efficiently.</P>
        <P>Some 78% of those who present in accident and emergency departments in Dublin do not require to be admitted to a hospital bed. We must find a speedier and alternative way to develop out of hours facilities, particularly in Dublin &mdash; in north Dublin, they are almost absent &mdash; to take some of the pressure off the accident and emergency services. We must also ensure that the late and delayed discharge of patients, in respect of which I just received information last week, is dealt with. We now know the nature of the patients&rsquo; situations and what alternative facilities they require. For example, in the Mater Hospital, approximately 31 of the 68 patients are suitable for alternative facilities such as nursing homes or returning to their own homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessors did nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The remedy will cover enhancing primary care, particularly out of hours cover; medical assessment units such as those referred to by Deputy McManus and improving discharge policy so that there are alternative facilities in place that will facilitate the discharge of patients who do not need an acute bed that costs approximately &euro;5,000 per week. These are among the initiatives we are examining. There are also issues in regard to the availability to clinicians of diagnostics on a 24 hour basis in order that they can make clinical decisions about their patients.</P>

	<P>I have a supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="413"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that despite being in power for seven and a half years, the Government has failed miserably to address the accident and emergency crisis? Is she telling the House that where Deputies Cowen and Martin failed, she will succeed and that she will produce a world class health system? Is she living is cloud cuckoo land? How will she do this without spending money? Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that we need to make up for the years of under-spending in the health service and that we cannot solve the accident and emergency problem unless we deal with the bed capacity problem, to which the T&aacute;naiste only referred briefly in her answer?</P>
        <P>The consultants and every oneelse tells us this is a bed capacity problem. Can the T&aacute;naiste explain to people who are on trolleys or in chairs where are the 3,500 beds, which were in the system in 1990? Will she speed up the introduction of these acute beds because surely this is the nub of the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I do not agree that my predecessors failed. Turning the health services around will not happen overnight, as I have already stated. We will not create the world class system &mdash; that we could and will have &mdash; in two and a half years, just as we did not turn the economy around in such a short time. However, I remain optimistic and positive that Ireland can achieve a world class health service in terms of how health care is delivered when the reforms that are under way are fully implemented. Clearly, if everything was well we would not be engaged in this programme of radical reform.</P>
        <P>The new HSE will take office from next year and we will have a more centralised and clearly more efficient manner in which to manage the health service, which has been a difficulty in recent years. We have learnt from experience that putting more and more money into an unreformed system does not make sense. This is why more money must be accompanied by reform. Next year there will be substantially more money. To meet the health service pay bill alone will cost an extra &euro;550 million, which is not an inconsiderable sum.</P>
        <P>It is too simplistic to state that this is a matter of more beds. We need more beds but we also need practice reforms, reforms in working methods, new facilities that do not require beds such as medical assessment units and more out of hours cover, particularly on the north side of Dublin where it is almost absent. These are among the reforms proposed as well as step-down and alternative facilities for those who are in acute beds just because there is no alternative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The case referred to by the Deputy is a tragic one and I extend my condolences to the family concerned. Deputy Neville raised the matter on the Adjournment some time ago but it falls today to consider what progress has been made on the implementation of the recommendation.</P>
        <P>The Mid-Western Health Board established an independent review committee in October 2003 to examine the circumstances of the tragic death of the patient, which occurred in September 2002. The final report of the committee was presented to the Mid-Western Health Board on 28 June 2004. A copy of the report was also made available to the family of the deceased and to my Department.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department recently met senior management of the Mid-Western Health Board to discuss the measures being taken to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations. They were informed that the Limerick mental health service welcomed the report and its recommendations, which provide a means to guide continuous improvements within the service. The recommendations have been converted into detailed and specific action plans and a working group has been established within the Mid-Western Health Board to implement the actions identified. The working group has been meeting regularly since early September and implementation is being monitored, reviewed and directly supported by the executive of the Limerick mental health service.</P>
        <P>Among the recommendations made by the committee is the need for progress on the development of an inpatient unit for children and adolescents in Limerick. I am pleased to inform the House that approval has been given for the appointment of a design team for the development of a 20-bed child and adolescent in-psychiatric unit on the Mid-Western Regional Hospital campus. Proposals for a high observation unit within the adult acute psychiatric unit in Limerick are also at an advanced stage, and this develop<Col N="415"/>ment is in line with another of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>On receipt of the report of the review committee last July, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, referred it to the Mental Health Commission. The commission endorsed the recommendations of the committee and indicated that those recommendations, which are applicable to all mental health service providers, would be incorporated in the quality framework currently being developed by the commission. This framework includes the development of standards for mental health care, clinical governance and codes of practice.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
        <P>The annual inspections by the Inspector of Mental Health Services provide for the ongoing monitoring of such policies and standards by the Mental Health Commission. We will continue to monitor developments in the mental health services to ensure that the recommendations of this report are fully implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and join him in expressing sympathy to the family concerned. Does the Minister of State agree that this report offers a unique and rare window to difficulties arising in our psychiatric services and exposes ten issues that arose regarding this tragic death? Does he agree that the culture of secrecy in our psychiatric services, protected by the stigma surrounding mental illness, does not facilitate open discussion on the difficulties arising in the psychiatric services? I request that he officially publish the report to allow full and detailed discussion of it. If this death occurred following an appendicitis or an accident with ten issues arising which seriously affected the life of the person concerned, there would be a national discussion on it.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the fact that this patient was removed from a private hospital in Dublin to a public facility in Limerick exposes that money decided the fate of the patient because of the money-orientated nature of the services? Will he agree to an independent inquiry into the death of another patient which took place one year earlier in October 2003 in the same unit? Will he respond to the call by the trade union representing the staff in this unit for this unit of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital to be closed?</P>

Those 33 recommendations are being acted upon. I am not aware of the earlier case to which the Deputy referred. If he communicates with me on it, I will raise the matter further.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am representing the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and I am not apprised of that case, but I will follow it up for the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to consider the Deputy&rsquo;s request for publication of the report, but as I understand it, the report is available to the public. I do not know in what format the Deputy wants it to be published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;there has been no lack of openness in this House on discussion of this matter. Deputy Neville raised it on the Adjournment and today during Question Time.</P>

	<P>That was not my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s question. There has been no lack of openness or candour in the replies prepared for me on this matter, which has been raised by the Deputy on the Adjournment and today on Question Time.</P>
        <P>As regards the openness of matters which fall within the province of the Mid-Western Health Board, that is a matter within the province of that board. When the Oireachtas in 1970 decided to establish the health board machinery, clear accountability structures were laid down within that machinery where the chief executive and the relevant officers reported to a board. I appreciate that at this time that structure is not in operation but we are about to introduce radical legislation that will refashion that system. The period to which the Deputy referred is a period in which there was a health board, the Mid-Western Health Board, in existence in that area. That matter was within the functional area of that health board and it was its responsibility to deal with the issue of accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1999 the National Disease Surveillance Centre was asked to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance, including MRSA, in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. It gave detailed consideration to these issues and drew up a strategy for the control of the resistance in Ireland, which was launched on 19 June 2001. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue, including a strategy to control the inappropriate use of antibiotics.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;16 million in funding has been made available to date, of which &euro;4.5 million was <Col N="418"/>provided this year to health boards to implement the strategy.</P>
        <P>A national committee comprised of a wide range of experts was established in 2002 to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies in regard to antimicrobial resistance. As part of its remit it provides advice to the regional SARI committees in each health board area which were established as a result of the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations. Tackling this problem is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. Implementation of the strategy is taking place on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January this year, MRSA bacteraemia is included in the revised list of notifiable diseases of the infectious diseases regulations so hospitals are now legally required to report an incidence of the infection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response. It is similar to a response given to a Priority Question on this matter in June 2001. Is the Minister aware that Ireland has the third highest incidence of infection from the MRSA bug in Europe? The incidence of the infection here is 42% compared with 44% in UK and 44% in Greece. The incidence of the infection here is the same level as that reported in Portugal, Malta, Italy and Croatia. Will the Minister explain why no statistics have been available since 2002 on the incidence of infection from the MRSA bug in this country? At that time it was indicated that 474 contracted the bug, but we have not been told how many people lost their lives as a result of contracting it. In the UK 7,000 to 8,000 people a year lose their lives as a result of contracting the MRSA bug. The UK authorities ask hospitals, in their own interests, to display the number of people who contracted the infection in their hospitals.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister ever spoken to anyone who contracted the MRSA bug? If not, she is looking at a person who has. I contracted it in March and nearly lost my life. I have been told by my consultants that I will get back only 60% of the use of my right arm. The Minister trots out the same reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>What measures will the Minister put in place? She should not trot out the same answer that the former Minister, Deputy Martin, gave in 2001, as she has done. I have with me a copy of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s response. Is the Minister aware that a survey shows that in hospitals this <Col N="419"/>year, 55% of doctors did not wash their hands between seeing patients, 35% changed their white coats only once per week and 9% wore gloves only when they were examining patients.</P>

	<P>I suffered from the MRSA bug. As I stated in the Chamber when the Minister was appointed, I waited for 17 hours in a hospital in the west to get an antibiotic to save my life.

	<P>I am genuinely sorry that Deputy James Breen had this experience. I was not aware of it. As I am sure he knows, the bacterium lives in about 33% of normal, healthy people. It lives harmlessly on the skin and in the nose of approximately one in every three people in the country. It causes problems when it gets the opportunity to enter the body. The Deputy is correct that the most effective way of dealing with it is hand hygiene. It seems incredible but we had to issue guidelines on hand hygiene recently. When I saw this in my briefing note, I had to check whether it was correct. The guidelines are for those who work in health care settings and equally to those visiting patients that suffer from the bacterium. The chief medical officer, to whom I spoke before Question Time, said to me that the most practical and sensible thing we can do to stop the spread of the bacteria in a health setting in which people are particularly vulnerable and sick is to encourage hand hygiene and the washing of hands. The guidelines are intended to achieve this and money is being made available to the different regions with a view to implementing best practice in this area.</P>

The position has improved over the months of August and September for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, generally. The authority continues to work with individual agencies to manage the situation. In respect of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals, the ERHA is working with the agencies and believes it will achieve a break-even position by the end of the year. This year, an additional &euro;4.6 million was allocated to the ERHA specifically to address service pressures in oncology and haematology, including oncology drug treatments in acute hospitals in the region.</P>

	<P>I got the impression from the Minister earlier that she was claiming credit for the success of the economy but I presume she was not making that outlandish claim. The issue at hand concerns the economies of specific hospitals in the Dublin region which are already in difficulties and experiencing particular pressure in the accident and emergency departments. Does the Minister not accept that if there are increases in the throughput of patients in the hospitals, it will add to their budget requirements? Does she not accept that there is a difficulty in terms of the increasing cost of drugs and greater patient pressure? The population is growing and the budgets for the hospitals are simply not keeping pace. What does the Minister intend to do about it?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has promised that there will be 900 extra beds in the system by the middle of next year. How many actual beds will be provided in this timeframe and how many of them will be in <Col N="422"/>the hospitals in question? How many of them will be staffed? The staffing needs will add to the budgetary requirements of the hospitals, which are under pressure and cannot even manage within their existing budgets. How will the Minister resolve this? Will she please state how many inpatient beds &mdash; acute beds that are needed &mdash; will be provided from the figure of 900?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Successive Governments from all parties, including Deputy McManus&rsquo;s, can take credit for our economic success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>However, many of the policies on taxation and enterprise that are supported by the parties in Government have probably played a greater role in our economic success than those that have the opposite effect. We have different perspectives but shared ambitions. I am certainly not arrogant enough to claim full credit for our economic success. The same applies to the health service which requires many people working at every level.</P>
        <P>On beds, I answered a question by Deputy McManus yesterday. She has the breakdown so I will not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not give me the information I seek. It is not specified whether the beds are inpatient acute beds or otherwise. Of the promised 900 beds to be provided by mid-2005, how many are inpatient beds that will relieve pressure in hospitals and how many are day care beds, including couches, trolleys and recliners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy than none of the 900 beds is a trolley, couch, armchair or whatever the Deputy is suggesting. They are beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they are beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not call a couch a bed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but the Minister does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Deputy&rsquo;s pardon but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Health and Children has provided the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I spent considerable time talking about this to my officials yesterday after the Deputy made her incorrect assertion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Hospitals must live within budgets and the new hospitals office will insist that they do. We cannot plan anything if people do not live <Col N="423"/>within budgets. That will have to be the way as we go forward. Otherwise, nobody can plan for the circumstances that will arise.</P>
        <P>On new beds, there is a proposed new hospital for the Mater. As of now, it is not proposed to have any additional beds therein. We need to reconsider this. Clearly, if we are providing new, state-of-the-art facilities, we must use them to increase the bed capacity in the Dublin area. I certainly wish to pursue this in conjunction with my colleague, the Minster for Finance, in the context of our Estimates. We may argue about how many we need but the bed capacity strategy suggested 3,000 between now and 2011. Clearly, if we need more beds, we must provide them through the projects that are under way.</P>
        <P>The intention is that when the Health Service Executive, HSE, begins, it will do so with a clean balance sheet and not with a debt from this year. We will insist upon this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister on the new hospital at the Mater but surely she cannot say that there will be no additional beds in the meantime. It is quite clear that if one goes to the accident and emergency department &mdash; I recommend that one does &mdash; one will see the additional capacity that has been provided very quickly therein. A resuscitation area has been provided in prefabricated units. Surely the Minister is not saying the hospital will have to wait for a new building before it can have additional acute beds. That is a question of policy.</P>
        <P>Technically it can be done within a very short time if staffing and funding is in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As Professor Miriam Wiley from the ESRI said, faster turnover even by one day and earlier discharges of those who do not need to be in an acute bed would provide substantial capacity. The issue of bed capacity is being examined in the context of what I said earlier. We must examine what our resources will allow us to do in that context. Planning on a national perspective through the new HSE will make it easier to have a more integrated co-ordinated approach in this area.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no plans at present to introduce legislation to give an indemnity to persons who render assistance in emergencies. The need for such legislation has not been demonstrated. To initiate a claim for compensation against a person who rendered assistance in the course of an emergency, a plaintiff would <Col N="424"/>have to establish that the person concerned owed a duty of care to the person who had been taken ill and that this duty had been breached resulting in loss or injury. This is virtually impossible under Irish law. The clinical indemnity scheme provides indemnity cover for professional staff employed by health agencies covered by the scheme for good samaritan acts. This decision was taken to facilitate suitably qualified and experienced staff in coming to the assistance of people involved in medical emergencies. I am considering having the scheme extended to cover volunteers who have been recruited and trained by health boards to operate portable defibillators in remote areas which might otherwise lack such a service. These initiatives are sufficient to deal with all reasonable needs for indemnity cover.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply. I am pleased she is considering extending the scheme. When will the scheme be operable because many communities are waiting to get started?</P>

	<P>I look forward to discussing a number of issues with the consultants. These are key to the reform agenda in the health service. My strong view is that we should sit down within a timeframe and discuss all the issues together. I have assured them that I will be fair and business-like in the manner in which we deal with them. However, we cannot have an open-ended agenda where no one knows where they stand. That would not be satisfactory.</P>

	<P>That is one of the issues I am discussing with the Attorney General.

There are many issues involved from the Irish taxpayers&rsquo; point of view which must be resolved fairly. I am in discussions with the Attorney General on the matter. I do not expect that patients will not be covered or that consultants will be left exposed.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Minister for Finance if he is satisfied with the measures taken to avoid flooding following the latest incidents in Dublin and along the south and east coast yesterday; and the steps, if any, to compensate those who have been adversely affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take the questions together. First, I express my sympathy and that of the Government to everyone affected by the flooding incidents which occurred yesterday and today. It has been a very traumatic time for all those directly affected.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware from weather predictions in the past day or so that the flooding we have experienced has been due to a combination of natural events, heavy rainfall in recent weeks leading to wet ground conditions, intense rainfall in the past 24 to 36 hours, low atmospheric pressure combined with spring tides and storm force winds. The extent of the flooding around the country is not yet totally clear. I have, to date, received reports of several severely affected areas, including Cork city, Waterford, Arklow, Mallow and Wexford. There are many other areas where localised flooding occurred on a smaller scale but, of course, that is not less traumatic for the people directly affected.</P>
        <P>I commend the hard work undertaken in the past 24 hours by local authority staff, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Defence groups, fire brigades and all other staff and volunteers involved. In an emergency situation such as this, the initial responsibility for assisting the public and protecting infrastructure falls to these groups operating at local level. They have done a very good job.</P>
        <P>As the immediate pressure of emergency response eases in the next day or so, my staff in the Office of Public Works, OPW, will be in contact with local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government to get a fully detailed picture of the flood events, locations, and numbers of people and properties affected. When this information is to hand, a judgment can be made on the question of the provision of humanitarian aid. The criteria used in assessing eligibility for aid are generally homelessness, damage to homes, serious injury, <Col N="427"/>or loss of income. The House should be aware that the policy in implementing humanitarian aid schemes is to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship arising out of damage to people&rsquo;s homes. It has not been the practice to include assistance to businesses in these schemes.</P>
        <P>As part of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study being undertaken by Dublin City Council, the OPW agreed in April 2002 to fund a study on flooding of the River Tolka. Following the severe flooding from the river in Dublin and Meath in November 2002, the OPW was asked by the three local authorities concerned, Dublin City, Meath County and Fingal County Councils, to assist in the implementation of a series of flood alleviation measures. Following discussions with each local authority, the OPW agreed to fund and undertake a range of works which were first recommended in interim reports completed by the councils&rsquo; consultants and which were also contained in the final report of the River Tolka flooding study. Dublin City Council, under the powers of which the works were to be carried out, exhibited a schedule of works for the city area in 2003 and again in 2004, as required under part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.</P>
        <P>The works undertaken by the OPW cover an area from Glasnevin Bridge to Luke Kelly Bridge in Ballybough. The works are almost complete and include the construction of walls and embankments, the replacement of Woodville Road footbridge, the lowering of Distillery Weir, the widening of the southern bank opposite Tolka Park, and general maintenance of the channel along this stretch. The OPW has expended approximately &euro;1.7 million so far on works in the city area and approximately &euro;3.5 million on the whole Tolka catchment. There are further works, which include the replacement of Distillery Road Bridge and the widening of some parts of the river around the bridge, which are the subject of negotiations between the council and property owners and developers as part of a proposed development in that area. The report contains no recommendations for downstream of Luke Kelly Bridge.</P>
        <P>With the support of the OPW, Dublin City Council, on behalf of the combined Dublin local authorities, has also commissioned a study of flood risk in coastal areas, entitled the Dublin coastal zone risk assessment. This study is expected to be finalised in the next month and will provide a long-term strategy for addressing the flood risk in the study area. Deputy Gregory has also raised the issue of anti-flood measures at Spencer Dock and I understand Dublin City Council will be commencing works there in the next few weeks. The work which has been carried out in the greater Dublin area and in County Meath in the past two years by the OPW, in partnership with the local authorities, has been successful. The evidence is there for all to see in the <Col N="428"/>last 24 hours. I hope I am not tempting fate with this assertion.</P>
        <P>With regard to flood relief works in other locations, I confirm that a scheme in Kilkenny city is nearing completion and a scheme to protect Carrick-on-Suir was completed last year. Schemes are at various stages of planning and design in other cities and towns, including Clonmel, Carlow, Waterford, Enniscorthy, Mallow, Fermoy, and Ennis. The House will note that neither Cork city nor Wexford are included in the current OPW flood relief programme. My officials will be in touch with the relevant local authorities in the next few days to assess the position in both these locations. As tidal influences are significant in both cases, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will also be consulted.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a strategic flood management policy. In that context, I remind the House that the Government last month approved the recommendations of the flood policy review group. This confirms the lead role of the OPW in taking a strategic approach to flood management in the future and working in co-operation with the relevant local authorities. The programme of flood relief schemes in hand will be implemented as resources permit in the context of an integrated, long term strategy on flood management. This strategy calls for considerable emphasis on non-structural flood management measures, for example, flood warning systems, flood mapping, guidelines on development and formulation of catchment flood risk management plans to foster a catchment-based approach to flood management. Account will be taken of the need to prioritise expenditure in the areas of greatest need and to be mindful of the implications of climate change. I am glad to be able to report to the House that the OPW has already commenced work on the development of flood warning systems and flood mapping as the first steps in this new approach.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that a coherent, sustainable, long-term strategy on flood management is in place, consistent with the recommendations of the flood policy review group and combining structural and non-structural measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s answer would have been suitable if it had been given last week. He speaks of a good flood management programme which is taking its course and doing fine. However, Cork city was under 5 ft. of water last night. I do not begrudge the aid that has been given to those people affected by the flooding of the Tolka river. We are used to this type of thing in Cork and those people have our every sympathy. However, the response to that flood bears no relationship to the response to what has been an ongoing problem in Cork city.</P>
        <P>Cork City Council has sought funding for the past 20 years to improve the quay wall. There has been a sign on one section of this wall for the last eight years warning motorists not to park too <Col N="429"/>near it in case it falls in the river, taking any nearby parked vehicles with it. In spite of this, The Minister of State has informed us that the schemes are in place and his Department will be in touch with the relevant authorities in Cork city in the next few days. The Minister of State has missed the boat. This is not the first time we have suffered flooding in Cork city, but the difference is that there was 5 ft. of flooding last night and part of my motion is in respect of compensation for householders and traders. One unfortunate family was taken out of its bungalow after it flooded to a height of 8 ft.</P>
        <P>It is too late to say to such people that the issue will be considered. The funding has been sought for 20 years and we know what needs to be done. There are certain areas of the city that need non-return valves with regard to the sewers. The quay wall must be raised in some areas and there are areas where the wall must be replaced. Other solutions may be proposed, such as a type of Thames barrier solution, but this is surely long-term. The immediate concern is a short-term solution which, in this instance, constitutes a period of 20 years. Will the Minister of State make urgent efforts early tomorrow to talk to the people in Cork to find out what needs to happen in the short term and ascertain the funding necessary for a long-term solution?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had direct contact with residents and traders in Cork. I understood that 4 ft. of flooding was the worst sustained, which is frightening in itself. That there has been 5 ft. of flooding, and 8 ft. in the case of the bungalow the Deputy referred to, indicates the severity of the situation. Flooding is a natural phenomenon and I have been told by traders in Cork that this was the worst flooding in 42 years. The schemes designed and operated by the OPW cater for a one in 100 flood. People tend to forget the severity of previous floods and many people in Cork will not remember the situation 42 years ago.</P>
        <P>I went through a number of the schemes which are in various stages of formulation, planning and design. The scheme for Kilkenny city has just been completed and the scheme for Carrick-on-Suir was finished last year, for example. Cork City Council has not approached the OPW so I assume it has contacted either the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The OPW would like to undertake all the schemes at the same time but we must prioritise. The Kilkenny scheme is superb but its cost, at more than &euro;40 million, was an issue of considerable debate. There was much criticism of the manner of expenditure on this scheme when it was considered by the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not mean to be insensitive but a flood is a major crisis for people and everybody demands that action be taken. When we make the plans next summer, people will not be the least concerned. All their concerns then will relate to archaeology, tourism, environment, <Col N="430"/>disruption to businesses, environmental impact statements etc., matters that lead to enormous expense.</P>
        <P>The situation in Cork is clearly extreme. As a result of the recommendations of the flood review group, we will be in direct contact with the Departments with responsibility for the environment and the marine with a view to seeing what can be done. Flooding is a natural phenomenon. No State agency is directed to counter such phenomena, but we can put schemes in place that will minimise the damage to individuals. The OPW response, on behalf of the Government, has been humanitarian aid and this has been warmly received. In 2002, we spent &euro;13.5 million on humanitarian aid. I assume that when the report comes through from Cork, we will consider it sympathetically. I, and Mr. Jim Bligh who is here with me from the OPW, undertake to make contact with the relevant Departments, although I am sure they will contact us urgently with regard to the difficulties in Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept I have been raising this issue with him since he was appointed and that the work he promised in Dublin in his first weeks in office has still not been completed? Does he accept that but for the fact that Dublin did not get the same level of prolonged heavy rainfall as did Cork and the south of the country last night, there would have been serious flooding yet again in the Clonliffe and East Wall areas of Dublin&rsquo;s north city because flood relief works have not yet been completed on the Tolka river or at Spencer Dock in the Royal Canal basin, despite the disastrous flooding of both locations in recent years? Last night, a bridge on Distillery Road, to which the Minister of State referred in his reply, had to be heavily fortified with sand bags by the city council to prevent the Clonliffe area being flooded, not from heavy rain but as a result of a high tide and strong winds.</P>
        <P>I have two specific questions for the Minister of State, questions I raised previously on a number of occasions. When will the Distillery Road bridge be replaced as previously promised? The negotiations with the developer have been ongoing for two years and the Minister of State has been telling me about them for that time. What is the problem?</P>
        <P>Second, I am concerned about the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply with regard to Spencer Dock. This is not the first time I have heard the city council is to move in &ldquo;within weeks&rdquo; to start work. I understand that this may mean they will move in within weeks to start &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; work at Spencer Dock. The critical issue at the dock is that the sea lock needs to be restored and a new canal lock constructed. Neither of these projects is near being started as far as I can establish. Is there a timescale for this work? If that critical work is not carried out at Spencer Dock, the whole East Wall area and community will be left under threat <Col N="431"/>from flooding, particularly at this time of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two brief questions. Will the Minister of State ask the local authority, in this case Dublin City Council, whether it will commence a study or examination of the Clontarf area, particularly the Clontarf Road area, as it has a recurring problem of flooding? There was a major problem there last night.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Tolka river issue, will the Minister of State convey my concern to Dublin City Council and urge it to provide enough finance to resource the flood prevention measures on Richmond Road, Clontarf Park and Gracepark Road as these were directly affected previously and have a long history of flooding? I urge the Minister of State to make representations or some statement on the issue of the insurance companies and ask him to persuade them to reinstate flood and storm cover as many residents who live near the Tolka have been complaining about this issue for the past six months.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="432"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister of State that last night&rsquo;s events in Cork city have put a question mark over the viability of many businesses in the city and that if measures are not taken to alleviate flooding, many businesses will move from the city to the suburbs. Will he correct the impression he has given that Cork City Council has been negligent in not applying to his Department for flood relief measures? I raised this question for reply from the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister, but the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, happens to be taking the question today.</P>
        <P>The approach to dealing with this issue by the different Departments responsible is disjointed. Will the Minister of State send officials immediately to Cork city to discuss the questions raised by Deputy Lynch, the quay walls that have been left in a dangerous condition and the non-return valves and sewers? Will they discuss the situation regarding a tidal barrier which would demand huge resources but would provide a solution to the problem?</P>
        <P>These are engineering problems and I am not qualified to discuss them. However, huge investment is required in the area to deal with what is not a once-in-40-years event but an event that occurs almost every year in Cork city centre. What happened last night is not new, but we expect action to eliminate or reduce the threat to Cork in the future. As a result of the threat from climate change, the problems will get worse, not better, unless the relevant Departments intervene.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State eliminate the disjointed approach by different Departments to the issue and clarify the situation? He appears to be putting the onus on Cork City Council by saying it has failed to request funds from Government on a number of fronts. If he checks with the Departments he will discover requests have been made for assistance over many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Deputy Boyle, regrets he cannot be here today as he is in Cork helping his beleaguered constituents. Why did the Minister of State mention only the Tolka river? No mention was made of the Dodder river. My constituents in Ringsend, Sandymount and Irishtown are, perhaps, the most vulnerable to flooding. Why was it necessary for me to go at 12 o&rsquo;clock last night to see the situation on the ground? Deputy Gregory is right, if there had been more rain, there would have been serious flooding along the coast. There were sand bags in place in Sandymount.</P>
        <P>Why was it that when the protective wall was built in Irishtown, along the front of Stella Gardens, it only went as far as Londonbridge Road? This makes no sense because the water will not stop there but will flow down into Stella Gardens. We cannot just have symbols, some thought must be put into the situation. Protective measures for the Dublin coastal zone were mentioned. How much will these cost and when will they be provided? The Minister of State must accept that the <Col N="433"/>frequency of floods will increase significantly as a result of climate change, higher precipitation and the associated problems of climate change such as rising sea levels. These combined problems will have serious consequences for my constituents. What plans has the Minister of State and when will they be implemented?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State aware that there was serious flooding in Arklow, County Wicklow last night? Once again, the south quay area was flooded and homes were affected. Will the Minister meet the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who has been very supportive in putting in place the flood protection scheme, which cost &euro;3.5 million? Will the Minister of State meet Deputy Roche to progress this proposal to ensure that the people of Arklow are protected in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Clontarf area was included in the coastal zone study. While that study is not complete, works there will be a priority. I had contact with some of Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s constituents this morning who told me about their basements being flooded. I am keeping abreast of the Clontarf situation.</P>
        <P>There were two years when insurance companies made substantial pay outs. When I became Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works there was ambiguity regarding the responsibility of different Departments and there was an element of ball passing. I undertook a flood review policy and invited all the stakeholders to take part, including the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Agriculture and Food and Finance and the OPW.</P>
        <P>We received more than 70 submissions, including one from the Irish Insurance Federation. The insurance industry bleated about its major pay out over two years. However, if there was never a threat of a flood no one would take out flood insurance. I do not have great sympathy for the industry. The work that has been done, particularly in the Tolka area, has substantially diminished the risk of flooding in those areas. If individuals are being victimised I would like to hear about it because that is unfair. We have recently seen the very substantial profits made by the insurance industry and I see no justification for victimisation of individual householders.</P>
        <P>Deputy Allen referred to the disjointed approach of Government. We undertook the flood policy review to achieve joined up Government. The review has recommended that the OPW should be the lead agency. The report is hot off the presses. I dealt with it on RTE this morning because emergency issues have become a bigger issue than the long-term view.</P>

	<P>Clearly, the council has been dealing with the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

	<P>Dublin City Council stopped the project. Perhaps the money ran out. The overall scheme has been successful. I spent some time there and it looks very well.</P>
        <P>I was in touch with some Arklow people this morning and I met a delegation from Arklow in the past 15 months. The OPW funded a consultative report with Arklow Town Council. The report has been completed and must now make its way towards implementation. It must fit into the prioritisation. We have given an undertaking to prioritise our spending. Currently, the OPW spends approximately &euro;20 million per year on flood relief measures. The report says the Government needs to spend approximately &euro;400 million in the next 15 years.</P>

      <sTitle>Hospital Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving Deputy James Breen and me the opportunity to raise the important issue of why the Mid-Western Health Board has not installed a CAT scanner in Ennis General Hospital, given that the money is ring-fenced for the unit.</P>
        <P>There had been much talk of overcrowding in Dublin accident and emergency units and rural hospitals are often forgotten about. Ennis General Hospital is one such hospital. We have a continuous overcrowding problem with patients been kept in day wards all the time.</P>
        <P>Every hospital needs to provide a safe service and the lack of such a service in a county will eventually lead to someone&rsquo;s death. We saw what happened in Monaghan earlier this week when an ambulance carrying a man with a suspected heart attack had to pass Monaghan hospital and make its way to Cavan General Hospital 30 miles away where the man died on arrival, despite frantic efforts by ambulance crews to save him.</P>
        <P>Ennis Regional Hospital has a proven record in patient care, working within the budget of the Mid-Western Health Board, unlike some of the bigger hospitals, with a dedicated staff who unfortunately work in an outdated building and lack some very modern diagnostic equipment.</P>
        <P>A CAT scanner is not a luxury in medical terms today. It is a necessary piece of equipment for any acute hospital whether local or general. It gives an instant accurate 3D X-ray reading on a patient, which is vital. Not only will it save lives, it will save money and, unfortunately, this is all about money.</P>
        <P>A CAT scanner will save lives. Given an instant reading, the consultant can make his decision on the welfare of the patient without further delay. It will save money because at least three patients per day have to be transported from Ennis by ambulance to Limerick Regional Hospital for CAT scans and these have to be accompanied by a nurse. It will also free up the overcrowding in Limerick hospital and there will no need for appointments or delays.</P>
        <P>We cannot afford to wait any longer for this necessary equipment. We need a consultant radiology service based in Ennis with a minimum of two postings. We are waiting for the development plan that is said to be with the building unit of the Department of Health and Children since the end of September. We are still waiting. This project needs to be fast tracked and not just built on <Col N="438"/>a phased basis. Even if the &euro;20 million development commenced tomorrow morning it would take years to complete.</P>
        <P>The best people to ask about the genuine fear for patients in Ennis are the consultants and I am disappointed to learn today from an answer to a parliamentary question that the T&aacute;naiste has refused to meet a group from the hospital. They will tell the real picture, the difficulties and the problems they encounter working with patients every day with limited diagnostic equipment. They want to give better, efficient and safe health care to the people of County Clare but are being prohibited by the snail&rsquo;s pace approach to the development control plan investment, the lack of additional consultants and physicians and the fact that a basic equipment like a CAT scanner, which in today&rsquo;s modern technology is the bread and butter for any acute hospital, is not available.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to see that the health board installs this equipment without further delay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister to tell the people of Clare when the upgrade of Ennis General Hospital will take place. When the previous Minister for Health and Children came to the county four years ago he promised that Ennis General Hospital would be upgraded. He put a price on the project of £15 million. During the previous general election campaign members of the Government parties rushed to the media to spread the good news about the upgrading of Ennis General Hospital. Earlier this year, during the campaign for the European Parliament and local elections, local Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and prospective MEPs again announced the upgrading of Ennis General Hospital. However, at a meeting in Ennis on 18 October, consultants informed local Members of the Oireachtas that the upgrading will not work. A CT scanner is needed in Ennis but such an item is of no use without the appointment of two radiologists. An additional consultant surgeon is also required. Two surgeons are working a 1.2 rota, which cannot continue. For the safety of patients in Ennis, an extra surgeon is required. We also need two additional consultant physicians, one for geriatric care and the other for respiratory medicine. To assure the continuity of an acute hospital service in Ennis, the development plan originally presented in 2000 needs to be expedited. The development plan needs to go ahead in its entirety. We cannot have it introduced in three phases because it will not contribute to patient care.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should tell us when we will see bricks and mortar going into Ennis General Hospital to ensure its upgrade. We want no more empty promises because we are sick of them. The Minister of State should tell us clearly when this upgrading will occur. It is badly needed for the care of patients.</P>
        <P>Hospital treatment in Limerick is far superior to that in Ennis General Hospital but that should not be the case. Ennis should be entitled to the <Col N="439"/>same benefits that are available in any other hospital. I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment but he should indicate clearly when this upgrading will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy James Breen and Deputy Pat Breen for raising this matter. It is nice to see colleagues from the same constituency working in harmony. Long may it last.</P>
        <P>The provision of services at Ennis General Hospital is the responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board. The Department of Health and Children approved the appointment of a project team and the appointment of a design team to plan for the development of facilities at Ennis General Hospital. The proposed priority areas for development include the accident and emergency department, outpatients department, radiology, and inpatient ward areas. I understand that the preparation of an outline development control plan is nearing completion. It will help to define the scope and content of the first phase of redevelopment for Ennis General Hospital and to confirm final decisions on the sequence of construction work in due course. The plan will be submitted to the Mid-Western Health Board for consideration.</P>
        <P>I understand that the provision of CT scanner facilities at the hospital is acknowledged in the outline development control plan. The development of facilities at Ennis General Hospital, including CT scanning, will be considered in the usual way during the course of planning and designing of the major project. I understand that the Mid-Western Health Board has been advised that the capital cost of a CT scanner for Ennis General Hospital will be made available by way of donation from the mid-western regional hospitals development trust. However, the necessary infrastructure to provide for the installation of a CT scanner must be planned and prioritised as part of the overall project at Ennis General Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>

	<P>I have raised this matter on the Adjournment to find out why proper procedures were not followed in providing personal details under the Freedom of Information Act to Mr. Michael Bowler of Lourdes House, Gloucester Place Upper, Dublin. I want to know what action the Government will be taking to address the matter. I am also asking that the case involving allegations of abuse during his time at Errigal House, St. Kieran&rsquo;s, Rathdrum, County Wicklow, during the period 1980 to 1984 be re-opened.</P>
        <P>This is not an issue for the redress board or the courts. It is an issue concerning the State, know<Col N="440"/>ingly or unknowingly, placing obstacles in the way of one man&rsquo;s search for the truth. I have met Mr. Bowler on several occasions. He is a man of sound mind who only seeks the full facts regarding personal details about him which are held by the State, as well as seeking justice regarding his experiences in Rathdrum.</P>
        <P>Under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003, Mr. Bowler applied to the Eastern Health Board and subsequently to the East Coast Area Health Board for personal information held by the boards relating to him and his family. He later applied to the Department of Health and Children for similar information under the same Act. In all cases he was not provided with the full information to which he is entitled under the law. Despite a huge personal effort, he has not yet received access to anywhere near all the records held by the board.</P>
        <P>Some information was eventually made available but not enough and certainly not quickly enough. For example, information was provided to Mr. Bowler regarding the existence and whereabouts of his sister who he had not seen since she was placed in care at the age of six months. This information came too late for Mr. Bowler to re-establish a close and trusting relationship with his sister. Its delayed release has been the cause of much personal trauma. Other information held by the board has also yet to be released. I suspect that it is not being released because the State does not want to admit it was complicit in the abuse Mr. Bowler suffered and in the events that led to his brother&rsquo;s untimely death.</P>
        <P>I am eager to be proved wrong and I would be grateful for any information the Minister of State can provide that would suggest I am wrong. I do not expect the Minister of State or his colleagues to work miracles, but Mr. Bowler should be given full access to all of his files so he can get the full truth of what happened during his childhood, take action for legal redress, if appropriate, and, most importantly, get on with his life, as everyone wants to do.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to re-open another case concerning an investigation that was being carried out by Sergeant George Kyne from Harcourt Terrace Garda station. He originally contacted Mr. Bowler in November 1995 regarding a Garda investigation into abuse in Rathdrum. No subsequent charges in this investigation were pursued by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed and newspapers have reported that no specific investigation into the abuse alleged by Mr. Bowler was ever undertaken. I am talking about the general abuse and also the specific abuse to which Mr. Bowler refers.</P>
        <P>To put the story of Rathdrum in context, Mr. Bowler&rsquo;s brother Jason ran away from that institution and lived on the streets of Dublin rather than put up with the abuse he suffered. He died at the age of 22 from a heart condition exacerbated by his years spent living rough. I am referring to Mr. Michael Bowler, rather than his <Col N="441"/>brother Jason but there are numerous clippings about how Mr. Jason Bowler &mdash; who was named as Tom in the newspapers &mdash; spent his years living rough under the care of Fr. Peter McVerry. The Minister for Health and Children at the time was complicit, acknowledging there was a duty of care to Jason, yet allowing him to roam freely. That matter will have to be dealt with at a later stage but I am now discussing the question of some form of justice for Mr. Michael Bowler.</P>
        <P>Will the State admit that it was complicit in letting Mr. Bowler suffer in the way he did? After all his troubles and the way in which he was treated by various State organs, the least we owe Mr. Michael Bowler is to re-open the investigation into the abuse at St. Kieran&rsquo;s in Rathdrum. The investigation should involve all persons who are alleged to have committed abuse, including the individual named by Mr. Bowler during his 1995 interview. I respectfully ask that the case be re-opened and closely investigated with the full vigour it deserves. Will the Minister of State give a commitment that Mr. Bowler will receive some satisfaction from the State and that justice will be seen to be done in his case regarding the information he has sought? Will the Minister of State follow up this case or will he, as the State&rsquo;s figurehead on this occasion, let Mr. Bowler down again?</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual case. However, I will outline the current legislation and standards, which underpin the child care system. The Child Care Act 1991 obliges health boards to provide a wide range of services which include the promotion of the welfare of children, the protection of children at risk, the taking of children into care, the provision of child care and family support services and the supervision and inspection of care services.</P>
        <P>The emphasis of the Child Care Act 1991 is on supporting children and families in their own communities having regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of the child to be brought up in his or her own family. However, children are taken into the care of health boards or placed voluntarily in care due to a range of family circumstances and health boards have a statutory responsibility to provide appropriate services for these children either in foster care or residential care.</P>
        <P>Regulations have been made under the Child Care Act 1991 to provide for the placement of children in foster care or residential care and the requirements must be complied with by the boards. The regulations cover the operation of residential centres, care planning, supervision, visiting and review of all cases of children placed in care. Provision is also made for the inspection of residential centres. Health board operated residential centres are inspected by the social services <Col N="442"/>inspectorate and centres operated by the non-statutory sector are inspected by the registration and inspection units of health boards. In addition to the inspection process monitoring officers are employed by health boards to ensure that standards are met or progressed on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Based on the legislation and recognised good practices national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres have been developed against which inspections are made. Each standard is inspected against a number of criteria. As I mentioned, health boards have a statutory requirement to prepare and keep under review the care plan for each child in care. The health board is also obliged to satisfy itself that appropriate arrangements are in place to facilitate reasonable access and contact between children in care and their parents, relatives, friends and any other person whom the board considers has a bona fide interest in the child.</P>
        <P>The national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres, which were developed in 2001, include a standard on planning for children and young people. Among the criteria against which this standard is inspected is contact with families. This includes actively seeking to re-establish contact between a child and his or her family or significant others where contact has been lost. The criteria state that staff should be sensitive to the child&rsquo;s wishes on the matter of contact with family. They also state that the wishes of siblings to be placed together where possible should also be respected and if this is not possible arrangements should be made for them to have high levels of contact. When a young person does not have contact with family the reasons should be explained clearly to the young person and documented by the relevant health board or residential centre staff as part of the care plan.</P>
        <P>A children and a young persons version of national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres was published and distributed in 2004. National standards for foster care were drawn up in 2003 and a young persons version of these standards has been developed and distributed.</P>
        <P>The information provided by the Deputy is insufficient to enable the health board to identify with certainty the individuals referred to. While the Deputy has supplied some additional information this evening, if he wishes to provide further details such as date of birth, name and address of residential centre and care history including years in care together with details of his sister I will pass the details to the relevant health board and ask the chief executive officer to reply directly to him. Any further details on the issue of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation of alleged abuse should be forwarded to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter to highlight the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to consult the Food Safety Authority of Ireland <Col N="443"/>about the proposed introduction in Ireland of an oilseed rape product, Brassica Napus L GT73, which is genetically modified, given that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, at its meeting on 13 May 2004, unanimously decided to reject an earlier modified sweet corn, BT11, for placing on the market.</P>
        <P>There appears to be a difference in approach by the two Departments. In the case of the first GM food introduced in May, the lead Department was the Department of Health and Children. While Ireland voted in favour of BT11, it failed to get sufficient votes at the Council and ultimately on 19 May the European Commission under the commitology rules decided to allow BT11 to be placed on the market. The lead Department for this GM product, Brassica Napus L GT73, is the Department of Agriculture and Food, not the Department of Health and Children. There seems to be an inconsistency in approach.</P>
        <P>Although the European Food Safety Authority and, I believe, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, if it was consulted, cleared this new GM food, Ireland abstained in the vote on 16 June. On the one hand on an earlier occasion when the Food Safety Authority of Ireland cleared the food, Ireland voted in favour, the second time the authority cleared the food, Ireland abstained. I have raised this matter at the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Health and Children, which unanimously rejected the introduction of a GM food in Ireland. We need an interdepartmental approach by the Departments of Agriculture and Food, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Health and Children to analyse all these GM foods to determine whether Ireland wants them.</P>
        <P>Allowing GM foods into this country will seriously erode Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of prime natural food. We have nothing to gain and everything to lose by allowing GM food into the country. We need a consistent approach. Why did Ireland abstain at the meeting of the regulatory committee on 16 June? Does the Government have a consistent policy on these GM foods? Will it establish an interdepartmental committee to monitor all these foods? I know the Minister of State has good contacts in this regard. As he is aware, the public are considerably concerned about generically modified food and this requires concerted Government action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I assure him that very effective and efficient lines of communication operate between officials of my Department and those of the Departments most actively involved in the whole GMO crops, food and feed issues, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Health and Children, and by extension the <Col N="444"/>EPA and the FSAI. All five bodies are represented in some form or other on the various groupings addressing GM matters in this country.</P>
        <P>I would like to set the background to the approval system for GM products. Prior to the coming into force last April of EU Regulation 1829/2003 on GM Food and Feed, which covered, <i>inter alia, </i>the approval and authorisation of new GM food and feed products, approvals were dealt with under two separate items of legislation. EU Regulation 258/97 on Novel Foods, administered by the Department of Health and Children and the FSAI, covered GM foods while EU Directive 2001/18 and it&rsquo;s forerunner EU Directive 90/220/EEC, administered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EPA, covered GM feed. Since the coming into force of the new GM food and feed directive last April my Department has assumed responsibility for approval of GM feed applications.</P>
        <P>Application for approval of the GM product referred to by the Deputy was made by Monsanto in summer 1998 under EU Directive 90/220/EEC, the forerunner of EU Directive 2001/18. Following the entering into force of Directive 2001/18 and the recommencement by the European Commission of the process of examining such notifications, the application was considered under the strengthened framework afforded by Directive 2001/18. The product is a genetically modified oilseed rape, referred to as GT73, with the modification allowing the crop to be tolerant to glyphosate herbicide thereby facilitating improved weed control during cultivation. This GM crop is cultivated extensively in the USA. Monsanto, which already received approval in November 1997 under the novel foods directive to market refined oil from this GM crop as a food use, is now seeking approval to market the product for animal feed. The issue of cultivation of the crop within the EU does not come into question.</P>
        <P>The EU assessment process for any GM approval application is the most comprehensive in the world and is extremely stringent. This product has been subjected to its full rigours. The application was initially submitted to the Dutch competent authority, which raised no objection to the placing of the product on the market. The Irish competent authority, the EPA, following consultation with my Department, the Department of Health and Children, Teagasc and the GMO and novel foods sub-committee under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s scientific committee, indicated that it had no objection to the Dutch view. Neither did the competent authorities of Sweden and Finland.</P>
        <P>However, concerns were raised by some other member states which referred mainly to such issues as the need to ensure a more robust post-release monitoring plan and to identify and deal with unintended spillage and dispersal of seed during transportation. In the light of these objections, the Commission requested the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, and <Col N="445"/>its opinion was that the oilseed rape in question was as safe for humans and animals as its conventional counterparts.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the procedures laid down in Directive 2001/18/EC, the Commission sent a proposal for approval of the application to the regulatory committee for the purposes of that directive for consideration. The regulatory committee is representative of all member states and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government attends on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P>On 16 June, that committee failed to reach a qualified majority decision and the matter has now been referred to the environment council for a decision. Ireland abstained in the vote at the regulatory committee to enable further consideration of proposals that were made by that committee to strengthen procedures for the monitoring of accidental spillage and dispersal of seed. The strengthened procedures proposed by the regulatory committee have not, however, been carried through in the proposal that the Commission intends to bring before the Council. This is something that the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be aware of in determining our national position at Council on the product.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is probably aware that the BT11 sweetcorn to which he refers, and which was appropriately administered by the Department of Health and the FSAI because it is a food item, was approved for marketing within the EU last July.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. This question is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I wish he was here to answer it. It concerns a long-running sore in the legal process that should be addressed, namely, the need for the Minister to provide paid legal representation to the McBrearty family before the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Morris published an excellent interim report on the findings of the first module examined by his tribunal into the behaviour of Donegal garda&iacute; earlier this year. The tribunal has now moved on to dealing with a new module at the heart of which are the McBrearty and McConnell families. A bizarre situation now exists in terms of legal representation. The Garda Commissioner is represented by two senior counsel, two junior counsel and two solicitors. The Garda Representative Association has separate and similar legal representation, as have the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Incredibly, there are four separate high-powered teams representing the Minister and the Garda. Already, &euro;2 million has been paid to these legal worthies from the Garda overtime fund at a time when the Minister is cutting back on Garda overtime and has not delivered on the 2,000 garda&iacute; promised two and a half years ago by this <Col N="446"/>Government. The Minister, in his inimitable fashion, has managed to do the unthinkable. He has put together a legal team to represent him at the tribunal and has to date paid each of the two senior counsel &euro;150,000 not to be present and not to attend the tribunal. Why has it not been possible for the Minister to put together one single legal team representing the interests of all those people wearing the jersey of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? What is the purpose of burdening the taxpayer with separate legal teams each doing basically the same job? The Minister has spoken about reducing the exorbitant legal fees at tribunals. He can now set the good example himself by dispensing with his own legal team and by combining the other three into one.</P>
        <P>This is also the opportunity for the Minister to review his refusal of paid legal representation for the McBrearty family. There is an anomaly at the Morris tribunal at present. There are five full heavyweight legal teams, including the tribunal&rsquo;s own team, holding a watching brief, making submissions, questioning and cross-examining on a daily basis. On the other side, Frank McBrearty jnr. and Mark McConnell have to spend five days a week representing their families without the benefit of legal advice or legal representation. This is because they and their families are at the heart of the tribunal&rsquo;s deliberations and the Minister has refused them paid legal representation. They cannot afford to pay for legal representation themselves.</P>
        <P>The best the Minister could offer was to give the chairman of the tribunal and the chairman of the Bar Council the imprimatur to trawl through the Bar Council&rsquo;s barristers seeking volunteers to represent the McBreartys without informing the McBrearty family or their long-suffering, unpaid legal advisers of seven years&rsquo; standing.</P>
        <P>The McBrearty family cannot get justice in the Morris tribunal without legal representation. They now face the unhappy choice of staying in the tribunal without effective means to participate in it or leaving it in despair and under protest. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should now know that there was something rotten in Donegal in the 1990s and that the McBreartys were victims of the wrongdoing. The State owes them paid legal representation to vindicate their good names properly. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide that paid legal representation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and thank Deputy Costello for raising this issue. The position with regard to the family in question has been raised previously in this House. I accept that Deputy Costello has raised questions about the Minister&rsquo;s legal team and the combining of those teams and I will ask the Minister to respond directly to him on that matter.</P>
        <P>The facts of this matter, however, are quite clear. The family concerned applied for, and were <Col N="447"/>granted, a right to legal representation at the outset of the tribunal&rsquo;s business in the summer of 2002. They chose to exercise that right and were fully represented by counsel during the opening of the Barron investigation module for six weeks in Donegal during the summer of 2003. Work on that module resumed for a week in September 2003 and was discontinued until May of this year while the tribunal completed and reported on the explosives module. The tribunal resumed hearings on the Barron module in June 2004 but the family have chosen not to be represented by counsel.</P>
        <P>Since September, during the course of the hearings members of the family have attended the hearings and have been permitted to conduct cross-examination of the various witnesses as they have seen fit and have been quite vigorous in their questioning. At various times since September they complained to the chairman of their inability to get legal representation for financial reasons.</P>
        <P>The chairman, Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, recently made efforts to resolve the issue. I understand from a statement made by the chairman at the tribunal that some progress was made by him in trying to secure the services of counsel who would act on behalf of the family without remuneration. This was not acceptable to the family and the chairman decided not to continue with his efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>The matter of costs has always been clear. Under the terms of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002, the question of costs is solely a matter for the tribunal. This is not only the legal position, it also has important practical implications for tribunals in their search for the truth. The Acts allow a tribunal which, having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters, is of opinion that there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it to be paid. A tribunal, when determining whether costs should be paid, may take into account failure to co-operate with, provide assistance to or knowingly giving false or misleading information to the tribunal.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting from the chairman&rsquo;s judgment on the costs associated with the first module that he regards co-operation with the tribunal and truthfulness in giving evidence as matters of paramount importance. In deciding on costs, he made deductions in some cases and rejected other applications where he was of the <Col N="448"/>opinion that persons deliberately lied or otherwise hindered him in his efforts to get to the truth. It is crucial that this power is available to tribunals and we should be very slow to consider any changes which would blunt the effectiveness of tribunals in uncovering the truth, as could be the case if the State were effectively to guarantee in advance the payment of legal costs for parties before tribunals. I appreciate we are discussing one family but there must be a clear and consistent principle behind the policy on the payment of costs which is applicable generally, not just in relation to any individual. I know, for example, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has consistently maintained the present position in the face of High Court challenges from a number of parties to the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P>I fully acknowledge that the establishment of the tribunal was to a significant degree brought about by the continued campaigning of this family and representatives on its behalf. Its fight for justice is to be commended. The forum now exists for it to achieve this. The chairman and his legal team are pursuing the truth with vigour and they will not leave any stone unturned in the search for the whole truth about the unfortunate events in Donegal. The Government will act promptly on its findings, and this has already been demonstrated.</P>
        <P>Coming back specifically to the question of legal representation for the family, I hope it is reassuring to the family and its legal representatives of choice to note that Mr. Justice Morris has acted promptly and has addressed the issue of costs arising out of the first module, on which he reported during the summer. By any standards, this is remarkably quick. It is clear that the chairman is cognisant of the difficulties of the various parties with regard to their legal costs and is acting to ameliorate the situation as best he can. I understand the tribunal is making significant progress on the current module and on this basis I encourage this family and its legal representatives to participate fully and co-operate with the tribunal to the greatest possible extent. I have no doubt that Mr. Justice Morris will endeavour to bring matters to a conclusion in the shortest possible time.</P>

	<P>Services at the Mater Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
        <P>My attention has been drawn to the figure of 530 beds in 2001 which was provided recently. This comprised a complement of 482 in-patient beds and 48 day beds. This breakdown was not made clear at the time. My Department is assured by the authority that the bed complement in the Mater Hospital has not been reduced since 2001. The current bed complement at the Mater Hospital is 556 beds, comprising 503 in-patient beds and 53 day beds. However, as the Deputy will be aware, it is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use from time to time.</P>
        <P>I am assured that there are no beds closed for financial reasons. The closures here arose for infection control reasons and because of difficulties in recruiting staff.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>her plans to develop the primary and secondary care aspect of the health services with a view to meeting the growing needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government and I are committed to developing all levels of our health services in a way that meet the needs of people throughout the country. Our strategy is to put in place <Col N="450"/>health services that are accessible and available to people based on their medical needs.</P>
        <P>This will require funding and reform together at every level, be it primary, secondary or tertiary care. We will have clear priorities for funding because resources will always be limited. We have clear priorities for reform also because we seek visible improvements in patients&rsquo; experience of health care at each level.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s funding and reform priorities recognise the central role that primary care has in delivering a quality health service. For most people, their interaction with their GP and others in the GP surgery is their most frequent point of contact with the health services. The effectiveness and quality of primary care affects all the other aspects of health services and the well-being of people. As many have recognised, our primary health care services represent good value for money and a quality service for people, irrespective of whether they are medical card holders or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Government policy is to develop further the range and quality of primary health care services throughout the country. The Government has supported the development of GP co-operatives to provide, among other things, the benefits of reliable out-of-hours services to the public. These have been successful in many parts of the country. Where they are not yet developed, I intend to use all available measures to bring about a situation where the public is adequately served by out-of-hours GP services. This is important in its own right but also as a measure to relieve pressure on accident and emergency departments of hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Government published a far-seeing primary health care strategy a number of years ago setting out a broad vision for team-based primary health care covering many disciplines in each GP centre. We are at the early stages of moving towards that vision of primary health care. There is great interest among many GPs in developing this form of primary practice. I welcome the ideas and innovations on how we can achieve the services we seek for members of the public, both medical card holders and fee-paying patients.</P>
        <P>In regard to secondary care, the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to develop hospital services in every region that will meet the more complex medical needs of patients both for elective and emergency treatment. We aim to develop acute hospital services on a regional basis that will command public confidence within each region, both in relation to elective and emergency services. The Hanly report on acute hospital services contained many proposals that will undoubtedly improve hospital services in each region of the country and will increase public confidence. For example, the recruitment of more consultants to work in teams at accident and emergency 24 hours a day, seven days a week, will improve the services available to the whole population of each region.</P>
        <P>The key to our decisions in delivering more services and opening more beds is to make invest<Col N="451"/>ment match need in a way that is both effective and efficient.</P>
        <P>Different services can be provided in different hospitals. Not every procedure needs to be carried out in the most sophisticated and expensive acute hospital setting. Some highly specialised services can best be provided on a national basis; most on a regional basis.</P>
        <P>To ensure the highest standards of clinical excellence and outcomes for patients, and to achieve best value for money, we intend to invest in a differentiated way in hospital services, matching services with the needs of the population in each region and nationally. We will also encourage private providers to innovate and to make available services to the public, which may also be capable of being purchased by the State for public patients. This is an established practice which we can make increased use of in ensuring that quality health care services are available to the whole population.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 45 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>Norovirus, more commonly referred to as the winter vomiting bug, is very resilient, highly infectious and can remain infectious for long periods. There has been an upsurge of activity of this virus throughout Europe and north America since 2002. It is important to understand that, since it is a community infection, outbreaks in hospitals are simply a gauge or reflection of what is happening in the community.</P>
        <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, has reported that there were 76 outbreaks of norovirus in 2003 and 64 outbreaks to date in 2004. Outbreaks cannot be eradicated, but they can be controlled. Within hospitals and other <Col N="452"/>health care settings, early identification of an outbreak and a rapid response is the key to its control.</P>
        <P>The NDSC was requested by the former Minister for Health and Children to draw up a set of national guidelines on the management of outbreaks of norovirus. These guidelines were developed by a multi-disciplinary working group, the sub-committee of the NDSC Scientific Advisory Committee, representing all professional groups which deal with such outbreaks, and were published in December 2003. These guidelines provide a framework to address the challenge of outbreaks of gastro-enteritis in hospitals and other settings caused by noroviruses.</P>
        <P>The guidelines are intended for use and adaptation in all health care settings. Local arrangements can be put in place to match local needs, but the above principles should guide decision making in all circumstances. I have already dealt with issues relating to MRSA in my response to the Priority Question No. 5.</P>

	<P>The provision of step-down services for people ready to be discharged from hospital is a key element in ensuring health services are matched exactly to patient needs. It is a priority to increase the availability of community nursing and other units that would meet the needs of people who need care that could not be adequately provided at home.</P>
        <P>Work has been under way in the Department of Health and Children on a proposal for a public private partnership investment scheme for 850 community nursing units. There have also been discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance in the development of this PPP scheme, as is normal and entirely appropriate with PPP projects.</P>
        <P>These are complex schemes and it is important to have a clear view of the benefits that will accrue given the complexity of the PPP contracting structure. The work that has been done so far has helped to clarify a number of issues. I intend to examine this project in detail very soon.</P>
        <P>The objective set by my predecessor stands, that is, putting in place a large number of nursing units that will greatly help people make the transition from an acute hospital setting to care matched to their needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 16 together.</P>
        <P>By way of introduction to this reply, I would point out that provision for risk equalisation is a necessary support to maintain the established common good principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover in our voluntary health insurance market, and has been the policy of successive Governments. The need for recourse to risk equalisation in a community rated market is recognised in the EU&rsquo;s third non-life insurance directive.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Insurance Acts and the provisions of the risk equalisation scheme 2003, the Health Insurance Authority has a central and independent role to play in relation to whether or not risk equalisation transfers between insurers are warranted. Participating insurers submit data returns to the authority on a six monthly basis, and the authority analyses these returns to assess the level of risk differential between the insurers. The risk equalisation scheme provides that: risk equalisation transfers cannot be commenced where the difference in the risk profiles of the insurers is less than 2% of the market equalisation percentage; risk equalisation transfers can only be commenced with a positive recommendation from the authority where the percentage is between 2% and 10%; and the Minister is obliged to consult with the authority on a decision to commence risk equalisation where the percentage is greater that 10%. The authority&rsquo;s first report, submitted at the end of April 2004, did not recommend the commencement of transfers, the then market equalisation percentage being 3.7%.</P>
        <P>The authority&rsquo;s second report in respect of the period January to June 2004 was submitted to my office last night and is being considered. The scheme provides that the authority may, if it thinks fit, release such reports to insurers, subject to the release not being effected earlier than 14 days from the date on which the said report was received by me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Persons presenting with eating disorders are generally <Col N="454"/>treated through the psychiatric services of their local health board. Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time.</P>
        <P>A tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available to public patients in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin where three in-patient beds are designated for this purpose. A similar service is available privately at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, James&rsquo;s St, Dublin and at St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin.</P>
        <P>The voluntary organisation, Bodywhys, provides advice and support to sufferers of eating disorders, their families and carers. My Department has provided funding of &euro;394,000 to Bodywhys since 2001 to further develop its activities in this area.</P>
        <P>An expert group on mental health policy is currently preparing a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services. The provision of services to people with eating disorders is among the issues being considered by the group. It is expected to report in 2005.</P>

	<P>I am aware that VHI premiums have increased by nearly 100% since 1997, if one includes both the increases that took effect from 1 September 1997 and 1 September 2004. While the increase is substantial, it must be looked at in the context of the obligation on VHI to meet claims in the period covered by any increases. Claims incurred increased by almost 90% from year ending February 1997 to year ending February 2004, and are projected to increase significantly in future years.</P>
        <P>Under VHI legislation, the VHI Board is responsible for setting premium rates. The legislation obliges the board to fix premiums to provide sufficient revenue to meet claims costs and to make such provision for reserves as it sees fit. It is a matter for the VHI Board, in discharging its responsibilities as regards setting premium levels, to take account of all the key considerations, including the matter of affordability for its members. The increase in premiums must be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 28 and 46 together.</P>
        <P>The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella and, in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, can be administered to children between 12 and 15 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from the diseases concerned and to stop the spread of the diseases in the community. Measles, in particular, is a highly infectious and serious disease; approximately one in 15 children who contract measles suffer serious complications.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, uptake of the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, MMR1, is calculated on a quarterly basis among children of 24 months of age. In quarter 2, 2004, the national uptake rate for this vaccine was 81%. This represents an increase of 1% in the national uptake rate when compared with the previous quarter and an increase of 4% in comparison with the same quarter in 2003. In addition, uptake rates reported by individual health boards ranged from 76% to 91% &mdash; Table 1 refers.</P>

            <?oasys _xr?>*The most recent period for which uptake figures are available from the NDSC</P>
        </table>
        <P FLI="0">The national uptake rate of MMR1 has increased from 69% in Q4 2001 to 81% in Q2 2004. This trend has been reflected in each of the health boards, with all health boards having reported an increase in the uptake rate for MMR1 over that period. Although MMR1 uptake rates have been improving over the past year and a half, they are still 14% lower than the national target rate of 95%.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the unsatisfactory MMR immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in approximately 2,000 cases and three deaths, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake. However, I am encouraged by the fact that the immunisation uptake rates are steadily improving. Meanwhile, data provided by the NDSC indicate that from week one to week 40, <Col N="457"/>inclusive, of 2004, that is, up to 9 October 2004, 296 cases of measles were notified, which compares with 541 cases notified for the comparative period in 2003; this represents a significant reduction in the number of measles cases reported to date this year.</P>
        <P>A National Immunisation Steering Committee was established to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The report of the steering committee was launched in April 2002 and a National Implementation Group was subsequently established to draw up a phased national implementation plan based on the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of proposals in relation to childhood immunisation, which were submitted by the National Implementation Group through the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, on behalf of the health boards, &euro;2.116 million was allocated by my Department in 2003 to fund initiatives to improve childhood immunisation uptake. A further &euro;2.778 million has been allocated for that purpose this year. Funding in the region of &euro;800,000 has been allocated to health boards, via the HeBE, specifically for regional and localised projects which will focus on measures to improve immunisation uptake.</P>
        <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, the MMR vaccine discussion pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents, was launched. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the Department of Public Health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The pack is set out in Q&amp;A format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack enables health professionals to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
        <P>In 2003, CEOs in all health boards and the ERHA were asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions in order to prevent a serious measles outbreak. Health boards have undertaken a range of measures in their regions to improve vaccine uptake in their region. These include: information <Col N="458"/>sessions for professionals, for example, doctors and nurses in the area; information sessions for parents; distribution of information to the public, for example, leaflets on MMR available in public areas; advertisements taken out in local papers; advertisements on local radio stations; advice regarding immunisation, including MMR, forms part of every public health nurse consultation with parents; information leaflets displayed prominently in all health centres; information given to schools regarding the booster MMR; follow up of parents by letter and telephone where children have not been vaccinated; follow up with GPs and nurses regarding children in their area who have not been vaccinated; and information sessions for staff.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, my Department has convened a measles eradication committee to develop a national five year action plan for the elimination of measles and rubella in line with the WHO strategic plan for 2010. This committee had its first meeting on 30 September 2004 and is due to report to me by the end of June 2005.</P>
        <P>I again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

	<P>Generally, the reduction in recent years in the number of medical cards may be attributed to the increase in the number of people in employment and also the improved economic situation nationally. Another factor which affects this area is the review by health boards of medical card databases. Since 2003 this has led to over 100,000 inappropriate database entries being removed from these databases. Reasons for deletions included duplicate entries, change of address, cases where the medical card holder is deceased, ineligibility due to changed circumstances and normal reviews.</P>
        <P>The determination of eligibility of applications for medical card is a matter by legislation for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. A medical <Col N="459"/>card will be issued to a person, for whom, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, the provision of medical services for him-herself and-or their dependants would cause undue financial hardship.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the programme for Government. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 29 together.</P>
        <P>The advisory group examining the desirability of introducing a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for infants who suffered cerebral damage at, or close to, the time of birth made substantial progress in its work programme up to the end of 2003. It had completed the bulk of its research, including an examination of no-fault schemes in other jurisdictions. It also had the benefit of presentations by legal and medical experts from Ireland and abroad. Representatives of parents of children with cerebral palsy had also made a presentation to the group. The drafting of some chapters of the group&rsquo;s report had been allocated to a number of subgroups of the main group. The decision to include claims against consultants in the clinical indemnity scheme from 1 February 2004 has delayed the completion of the group&rsquo;s report. Consultants have withdrawn from ministerial committees and working groups. Therefore, it has not been possible to complete the group&rsquo;s report. I hope that when the difficulties surrounding the clinical indemnity scheme are resolved this group will be able to resume its deliberations immediately and complete its task as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>While I would like to see the group produce a report quickly, I do not believe that this has any adverse impact on the affordability of indemnity cover for consultants. Consultants now have all of their practice in public hospitals, including their private practice, covered by the clinical indemnity scheme. In addition, the Government has put special arrangements in place to ensure that indemnity cover for consultants in full time private practice and for any private practice undertaken by public consultants which is not covered by the clinical indemnity scheme remains affordable. Consultant obstetricians are required to only purchase indemnity for the first &euro;500,000 of any claim against them. There is also a protection against the cost of serial claims against any consultant in any one year. As a result, a consultant in full time private practices is paying &euro;100,000 per annum rather the full economic cost of &euro;350,000 for indemnity cover. This is a clear <Col N="462"/>demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with this issue.</P>

	<P>Discussions are continuing with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation on aspects of the coverage of claims against consultants by the clinical indemnity scheme. The major concern of both organisations is that there should be no doubt as to the position of consultants facing personal injury claims arising from events which occurred prior to the inception of the scheme. The Government&rsquo;s position on this matter has always been clear. The clinical indemnity scheme should not have to cover claims where insurance companies or mutual indemnity bodies had accepted premiums or subscriptions to cover these claims. This position is accepted by all of the insurers and indemnity bodies with the exception of the Medical Defence Union. The MDU has written to several of its former consultant obstetrician members in Ireland threatening to leave them without assistance in dealing with personal injury claims against them. The MDU has a moral and ethical obligation to provide assistance to these members. I also believe these decisions may be in breach of the MDU&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association. Against that background, the first source of indemnity should be the body which accepted payment to cover these claims. That body should be subjected to the maximum pressure, including legal pressure, to ensure that it lives up to its obligations. In the event that it continues to refuse assistance in these cases, the plaintiffs and doctors involved cannot be left in an uncertain position while the MDU is pursued to honour its obligations.</P>

        <P>My Department, and the Department of Finance, earlier this year agreed in principle the Capital Investment Framework, CIF, 2004-8, in terms of progressing the health capital programme for this year and in relation to the overall funding levels proposed. The framework will complement and indeed enhance the significant capital developments envisaged for the health sector under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Total health capital expenditure by my Department under the NDP in the period 2000-3 was in the region of &euro;1.7 billion.</P>
        <P>The new Health Capital Investment Framework 2004-8 proposes a total funding envelope in the region of &euro;2.7 billion, including provision for a new PPP initiative in relation to infrastructure for services for older persons. This unprecedented level of funding for the health capital programme reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing quality infrastructure to support all health care programmes to the benefit of both client and staff alike. The CIF is intended to enable my Department, and health agencies, to plan and manage more effectively the health capital programme in line with identified service priorities. While the planned funding over the period in question remains subject to the annual Estimates process and a sustainable overall budgetary position, the proposed annual breakdown is as follows:</P>

        <P>It has been my Department&rsquo;s policy under the NDP 2000-6 that greater balance should be achieved in relation to capital investment between the acute and non-acute hospital sectors over the lifetime of the plan. This policy will continue under the CIF.</P>
        <P>In devising the details of the CIF, various factors had to be taken into consideration. Obviously, account had to be taken of existing contractual commitments, or those scheduled in the near future, to complete projects now under way. This factor applies to both acute and non-acute projects. The question of possible non-capital implications arising from progressing capital projects to various stages is also a significant issue. Also, as is normally the case in any major capital programme, the level of contractual commitments will be greater for the earlier years of a multi-annual plan than for the latter period to 2008. The CIF caters for the continuance of all projects or other capital expenditure planned by my Department.</P>
        <P>Many non-acute projects, including mental health and primary care facilities are being progressed through the procurement process. A number of major acute hospital projects are also being progressed and require significant contractual funding commitments for the next few years. It is in this context, allied to the multi-annual nature of funding, that a greater number of non-acute projects was scheduled for the latter period of the framework. This is particularly the case, bearing in mind all the circumstances and complex factors governing the planning and delivery of the health CIF, including the timescales involved in delivering the larger projects in the non-acute sector. In the circumstances, it is not correct to say that funding for the non-acute sector, including the primary care or mental health areas, has been deferred for three years. Various levels of funding for all health care programmes will be progressed under the framework and in line with overall funding resources available.</P>

	<P>My Department is advised that the planned cardiac surgery of two patients at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin recently was deferred due to the lack of available staffed ICU beds. The beds due to be occupied by the patients in question were, instead, used to accommodate two emergency cardiac surgery cases that had to be carried out that day.</P>
        <P>The hospital seeks to prioritise elective cardiac surgery and minimise the number of deferrals. However, priority is always given to emergency cases which are, by their nature, unpredictable, and unfortunately this may necessitate the deferral of less urgent cases. This situation is not unique to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital and can occur across the hospital system where emergency cases require admission.</P>
        <P>The approved funded complement of nurses for the ICU at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital is 124. Currently, the ICU has a staff of 107 nurses. Because of the nursing shortage, the ICU is currently staffed for between 14 and 17 beds, depending on the case mix between intensive care and high dependency patients.</P>
        <P>There is a continuing difficulty worldwide in recruiting ICU nurses, particularly those trained in paediatric intensive care. With the co-operation of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital has made significant efforts to attract and recruit nursing staff into the ICU, including: an extensive advertising campaign which has been undertaken in Ireland and abroad. The hospital has carried out recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, Asia, the United Kingdom and Poland in an effort to recruit nurses; the hospital is working with four nursing agencies who continually work to recruit nurses on the hospital&rsquo;s behalf; and post-registration paediatric nursing students are specifically targeted for recruitment to ICU.</P>
        <P>In relation to the retention of nurses in the ICU, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital has a number of poli<Col N="466"/>cies designed to attract and retain specialist nursing staff, including family-friendly work policies and extensive education and support structures.</P>
        <P>While initiatives to recruit specialist ICU nurses have met with some success, and the hospital has made significant efforts to attract staff from Ireland and from abroad, it is regrettable that the target complements for these areas have not yet been achieved. However, I am advised that the hospital is confident that additional nurses will be recruited to the intensive care unit in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Paediatric Review of Nurse Education Group identified that there should be various educational options available for those wishing to register as a sick children&rsquo;s nurse. In recent months, my predecessor announced the establishment of an expert group to develop a comprehensive strategy for the future of midwifery and paediatric nurse education. This group has commenced its work, and will be reporting to me at the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Clearly, all possible measures need to be taken to reduce the possibility of the deferral of elective surgery at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital. However, given the unpredictable nature of emergency cases, the hospital cannot guarantee that elective cases will not, on occasion, require to be deferred.</P>

	<P>On 23 July 2003, my predecessor, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, announced that he had convened a review panel to conduct an independent review of the events surrounding the tragic death of the person concerned. The members of the panel are: Mr. David Hanly, Chairman; Ms Kay O&rsquo;Sullivan, Director of Nursing at Cork University Hospital, and Dr. Shakeel A. Qureshi, Paediatric Cardiologist at Guy&rsquo;s and St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, London.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the panel are to consider the report of the ERHA in relation to the events of 30 June 2003 at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin and to make such further inquiries and conduct such interviews as the panel considers necessary; to address the questions raised by the family; to examine protocols and procedures relevant to this incident having regard to prevailing standards of best practice, and to examine their application in this case; and to report to the Minister and to make such recommendations as it sees fit. Following the review, both reports will be made available. My Department understands that the work of the review panel is at an advanced stage.</P>

        <P>The roll-out of the national breast screening programme to the remaining counties is a major priority in the development of cancer services. This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group throughout the country have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where required. A capital investment of approximately &euro;20 million has been approved to construct and equip two static clinical units, one in the south and the other in the west. This investment will also ensure that mobile units are available to screen women in the relevant age group throughout the country. BreastCheck and my Department are fully committed to an expeditious approach to the national roll-out of the programme and representatives have met recently to progress the design process. Following the roll-out and when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to extending the upper age limit to 69 years.</P>
        <P>Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of the European working time <Col N="468"/>directive as it relates to the working hours of doctors in training came into force on 1 August 2004. The relevant provisions were transposed into Irish law by way of the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004.</P>
        <P>The ability of the management of the health services to effectively implement the European working time directive, EWTD, for the benefit of all NCHDs, is dependent on the full co-operation of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, at both national and local level. This process has been delayed for some time in the absence of agreement by the IMO to the establishment of a national implementation group and local implementation groups in each hospital. These groups would be representative of all relevant stakeholders in this process and are crucial to the achievement of progress on this issue.</P>
        <P>Discussions involving the HSEA and the IMO under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, have been taking place for some time. While some progress has been made, much remains to be resolved. The LRC has requested that both parties refrain from engaging in any form of unilateral action for the duration of the negotiation process. As a result, as of 1 August, health employers have not acted unilaterally in order to achieve compliance with the EWTD. In many sites around the country, the introduction of new rosters would facilitate significant progress towards EWTD compliance while maintaining safe patient care and existing levels of service provision. However, health employers, in response to the request of the LRC, are awaiting agreement between management and the IMO at national level before proceeding.</P>
        <P>In this regard, both sides have accepted a proposal from the LRC for the selection of eight pilot hospital sites to examine local implementation issues, and to develop plans for the full implementation of the directive. Preparations are well advanced for the establishment of the groups and two regional workshops, supported by both management and the IMO, are taking place this week to assist, advise and guide the work of the pilot groups. Further intensive negotiations under the auspices of the LRC are scheduled to take place on 2 November. I am hopeful that early progress can be made in resolving outstanding issues, so that full implementation of the directive&rsquo;s requirements can proceed without further delay.</P>

        <P>The provision of hospital services, including the appointment of staff, at Cork University Hospital, in the first instance, a matter for the Southern Health Board. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the information requested.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on neurology and neurophysiology services recommended significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The Comhairle report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications, will, in my view, offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and with the Irish Consultant Neurologists&rsquo; Association in relation to the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing.</P>
        <P>The appointment of the additional neurologists as recommended in the Comhairle report will have to be considered in the context of the resources available in 2005 and subsequent years.</P>

        <P>The number of smear tests carried out nationally is approximately 230,000 annually and represents an increase of almost 20% in recent years. In order to meet this increased demand, additional cumulative funding of &euro;11 million has been provided by my Department since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel, purchase new equipment and introduce new technology and thereby increase the volume of activity. In addition, a number of hospitals have undertaken initiatives such as contracting out of smear test analysis to external laboratories. These initiatives have resulted in a considerable reduction in waiting times in laboratories throughout the country.</P>

        <P>The Health Board Executive, HeBE, commissioned an international expert in cervical screening to examine the feasibility and implications of a national roll out of a cervical screening programme.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the Kerry area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, in the first instance. The board in consultation with my Department decided to build a new 72 bed community hospital in Dingle, County Kerry to replace the existing hospital. This new hospital will comprise a mix of beds for continuing care, rehabilitation-convalescent, respite, palliative care beds and beds which will be used for direct admissions by the local GP-primary care team. In addition, there will be a central module, a day care unit, a mental health day care unit and an ambulance base.</P>

        <P>This Government is committed to increasing acute hospital bed capacity as indicated in the health strategy. Since 2002, funding has been provided to hospitals to open an additional 900 beds. A total of 600 of these beds are already open and the rest will come on stream in 2004-2005. The table below shows details of the current position in relation to additional beds for which funding has been provided.</P><Col N="473"/>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, there has been a positive and committed response from both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling the tragic problem of suicide. In response to the recommendations of the task force, the National Suicide Review Group was established by the health boards and membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. Health boards, in particular, have a major role to play in co-ordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and parasuicide in this country. In this regard, resource officers have been appointed in all the health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the task force&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>My Department has given special attention over the past number of years to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives. Since the publication of the task force report in 1998, a cumulative total of more than &euro;17.5 million has been provided since towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This year more than &euro;4.5 million is available to the various agencies working towards reducing the level of suicide and attempted suicide in this country. This includes the health boards, the National Suicide Review Group, the Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>The recently published annual report of the National Suicide Review Group, NSRG, meets the requirement of The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, that the Minister for Health and Children will report annually on the measures taken by health boards to prevent suicides in the previous year. This report, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 September, outlines the measures taken by the health boards and other agencies in 2003 to help prevent suicide and reduce the impact of suicidal behaviour. The aim of the report is to facilitate the sharing of information across the health boards and other sectors regarding suicide prevention projects and to provide accurate and current information on the patterns of death by suicide in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I share the public concern about the level of suicides in this country and I am fully committed to the intensification of suicide prevention measures and research programmes and in this regard, work is now well under way on the preparation of a strategic action plan for suicide reduction. This strategy, involving the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, in partnership with the National Suicide Review Group and supported by the Department of Health and Children will build on existing policy and on the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on suicide. All measures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by suicide will be considered in the preparation of this strategy.</P>

The pharmacy review group report was published in February 2003 and I expect to take definitive decisions on it shortly. In addition, the health service procurement improvement project has analysed the State&rsquo;s procurement of pharmaceutical goods and services. A national drugs prescribing group is evaluating proposals in relation to the control of drugs costs contained in various reports, for example, Brennan and Deloitte &amp;  Touche, to determine their feasibility and early delivery as part of the health reform agenda.</P>

	<P>Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases, with approximately 10% of people having had an attack of asthma at some time. Asthma prevalence across Europe has sharply increased in recent years and in Ireland, the level of asthma has risen to 20% in young teenagers.</P>
        <P>Asthma is a complex disorder where genetics and environment play an interacting role. It is generally recognised that there is a need for further work on the multiple facets of gene-environment interaction and their relevance for measuring susceptibility to asthma.</P>
        <P>Asthma treatment has improved substantially in recent years, however, there is scope for the development and utilisation of asthma management guidelines which emphasise the key role of first line preventive therapy which will reduce morbidity and hospital admissions. A full range of treatment services is available for people with asthma, incorporating hospital and primary care services and assistance with the community drugs schemes.</P>
        <P>The first step in an asthma initiative is the recognition of the condition as an important cause of morbidity and mortality and also that it carries economic costs. A range of initiatives have been taken this year to prevent and control asthma, namely, smoking reduction &mdash; given the association between early exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke and childhood asthma, the Smoke Free at Work initiative and more general health promotion activities will ensure greater protection from toxic tobacco smoke. These are providing benefits to workers and the general public and help to reduce asthma and respiratory diseases; the Irish EU Health Presidency &mdash; as part of the Irish Presidency, a set of proposals were developed by the Irish Presidency in April 2004. These proposals called for the need for research into the factors underlying asthma; the development of common terminologies and better information systems on asthma; the exchange of best practice in relation to the prevention and management of childhood asthma; and involvement of all relevant stakeholder groups; Ireland hosted the EU&rsquo;s Joint Research Council, JRC, Childhood Asthma Envirogenomics Conference, which provided further research information on asthma and its causes; and information &mdash; Ireland already participates in international prevalence studies and additional work is ongoing with the ERHA on the development of further information systems.</P>
        <P>The initiatives outlined above illustrate the broad range of activities to reduce morbidity and mortality from asthma. This should provide a better understanding of the nature of asthma and highlight areas for development so that individuals affected can go about their normal activities without fear or concern.</P>

	<P>The primary childhood immunisation programme, PCIP, provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. The objective of the PCIP is to achieve an uptake level of 95% which is the rate required to provide population immunity and to protect children and the population generally from the potentially serious diseases concerned. The PCIP provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age. Under the PCIP parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner<Delete>, GP,</Delete> of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the national immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The schedule was most recently revised in October 2002.</P>
        <P>The recommended childhood immunisation schedule is as follows:</P>

	<P>In 1999, my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC gave detailed consideration to these issues and drew up a strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, which was launched on 19 June 2001. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including a strategy to control the inappropriate use of antibiotics.</P>
        <P>The SARI recommendations can be grouped into five main categories, as follows: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance; monitoring of the supply and use of antimicrobials; development of guidance in relation to the appropriate use of antimicrobials; education of health care workers, patients and the general public; and, development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community setting.</P>
        <P>The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland recommended that a national SARI committee be established to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies in relation to antimicrobial resistance. This committee was established in late 2002 and as part of its remit provides advice to the regional SARI committees in each health board area which were established as a result of the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations. The national SARI committee is comprised of a wide range of experts in the field.</P>
        <P>The current membership of the SARI National Committee is as follows:</P><Col N="479"/>

        <P FLI="0">Tackling the problem of antimicrobial resistance is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. Implementation of the strategy is taking place on a phased basis and will take a number of years to complete. To date, approximately &euro;16 million has been allocated by my Department to health boards to enable them to put in place measures to control antimicrobial resistance. It is ultimately a matter for each health board CEO to determine the priorities in each region. These priorities should take account of the recommendations in the SARI report and also the recommendations put forward by each regional SARI committee. Much of the funding is designated for improving hospital infrastructure for control of infection and for appointing additional microbiologists, infection control nurses and other healthcare professionals involved in the control of infection.</P>
        <P>Work on the SARI annual report for 2003 is nearing completion; the report will be presented to the national SARI committee at its meeting in December and will include details of the national committee&rsquo;s work to date.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is an annual SARI implementation meeting to which all parties involved in SARI are invited. These include members of the national committee, regional committees and sub-committees, various professional groups involved in the control of antimicrobial resistance, for example, microbiologists, infection control nurses, public health specialists and surveillance scientists, as well as representatives from my Department and health board administration. <Col N="482"/>The annual SARI implementation meeting was held in Tullamore in December 2003 and this year&rsquo;s meeting will be held next month in Dundalk. The 2004 meeting will be a joint North-South meeting with the antimicrobial resistance action plan, AMRAP, the equivalent strategy in Northern Ireland. Meeting participants are updated on the work of the national committee and feedback from the meeting is used to direct the priorities for the committee for the following year.</P>

	<P>The terms of reference of the post mortem inquiry require it to review post mortem policy, practice and procedure in all hospitals in the State since 1970, with particular reference to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal. The inquiry is also mandated to examine any arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in relation to retained organs, including pituitary glands.</P>
        <P>The chairman has indicated that she will provide a report on paediatric hospitals in December 2004. There are ongoing consultations with the inquiry in relation to the other elements of its remit, having regard to the Government decision that the inquiry should conclude by 31 March next.</P>
        <P>I am advised that individual hospitals have adopted differing policies in relation to the question of contacting next of kin of deceased persons whose organs were retained.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union as soon as possible. It is hoped that this will provide the framework for the development of legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, it is intended to establish an expert group to review organ donation, procurement and utilisation policy in Ireland. The work of this group will inform Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the discussions in relation to the proposed directive on organs.</P>

	<P>During 2002 and 2003, a series of meetings took place between management and the medical organisations to resolve the outstanding issues from the current consultants&rsquo; common contract. These negotiations resulted in the introduction of a revised grievance and dispute procedure for consultants.</P>
        <P>In 2003, preliminary talks were held between management and the medical organisations to discuss forthcoming negotiations on the new contract. Unfortunately, the opposition of these organisations to the extension of the clinical indemnity scheme to cover claims against consultants led to a decision by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, not to participate in further negotiations with effect from 1 February 2004, which has resulted in talks on a new contract being stalled.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to break the deadlock that has arisen, and I have indicated to the consultants that I am available to sit down with them to discuss a new contract in tandem with those issues that are of particular concern to them in relation to the clinical indemnity scheme. I am writing to the consultants to this effect today and I hope for a positive response.</P>

	<P>My predecessor, Deputy Martin, <Col N="486"/>and officials from my Department entered into discussions with the Department of Finance earlier this year to progress the issue of opening facilities that had received substantial capital investment. These discussions resulted in my Department agreeing to fund &euro;35 million of the required revenue costs from its overall existing funding. Further funding of these new units will be discussed in the context of the Estimates process for 2005.</P>
        <P>The agreement concluded with the Minister for Finance also provided for an increase in the national employment ceiling in respect of staff required for the commissioning of the new units.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement, the acute psychiatric unit at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, has become operational, 29 September 2004, and the commissioning of the remaining acute and non-acute new units is ongoing. Health boards have informed my Department that the new units will be brought into operation on a phased basis over the remainder of 2004 and early 2005. This phasing is necessary as each health board must go through a logistical process of recruiting and appointing additional staff and, in some cases, equipping new facilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertakes quarterly surveys of nursing vacancies, the latest of which is for the month ending 30 June 2004. A copy of this survey, which contains a breakdown by hospital-health board and voluntary agency, will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations and retirements, employers reported that 771 vacancies existed at 30 June 2004, a decrease from 1,007 vacancies in June 2003.</P>
        <P>The number of vacancies as of 30 June 2004 represents a substantial decrease from the end of September 2000, when employers reported 1,388 vacancies.</P>
        <P>The current vacancy rate of 1.92% is one of the lowest in recent years, and could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of <Col N="487"/>opportunities to change employment and locations.</P>
        <P>In 1998, there were 26,612 whole-time equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of December 2003, this figure had reached 33,765. This is an increase of over 7,150 during the period or 26.8%.</P>
        <P>The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of this Government for some time, and a number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 70% since 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards. The continuing attractiveness of nursing as a career for school leavers and mature code applicants alike is clearly evident from the number of applicants for such courses. For example, there were 8,300 CAO applications for 1,640 places in the autumn 2004 intake. This is most encouraging, given that there is an ever-increasing array of attractive alternatives provided by our third-level education system.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive range of financial supports have been introduced to support nurses in pursuing part-time degrees and specialist courses, including &ldquo;back to practice&rdquo; courses. Since 1998 nurses have been paid for overtime. Previously they had been given time off in lieu and the introduction of payment represents a further significant financial incentive for nurses.</P>
        <P>My predecessor introduced a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight to 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis. The figure of 33,765 whole-time equivalent nurses working in the health service translates into 40,119 individual nurses. Of these, some 29,629 work full-time, and 10,490 work job-sharing or other atypical patterns. Thus, over one quarter of the nursing workforce avails of family-friendly work patterns.</P>
        <P>The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing and the 1999 nurses&rsquo; pay settlement. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been <Col N="488"/>especially active in this area and, to date, 1,600 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.</P>
        <P>My Department gave approval in late 2003 to the roll out, on a national basis, of the health care assistant training programme. This is in fulfilment of a key recommendation of the commission on nursing. The main objective of the programme is to up-skill health care assistants so that, working under the supervision of nurses, they are enabled to take on a wider range of duties, thereby freeing up nursing resources to concentrate on exclusively nursing tasks.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the extensive range of measures I have outlined, including the substantial increase in training places, the recruitment of overseas nurses, the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives, in addition to close monitoring and assessment of the situation on an ongoing basis, will continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health services.</P>
        <P>In relation to predictions of an increase in nurse vacancies over the next 18 months, the lack of a cohort of nurse graduates in autumn 2005 is obviously a challenge for the health service. The difficulty arises because nurse education is moving from a three year diploma programme to a four year degree programme in line with the recommendations of the commission on nursing. The final cohort of diploma students graduated recently and the first cohort of degree students will graduate in autumn 2006.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department are in touch with senior nurse managers throughout the country on a regular basis and discussions indicate that the problem of a lack of graduates in 2005 will manifest itself in early 2006. As there will be a cohort of graduates available by early autumn 2006, the problem has a relatively short life span. A working group representing health service employers and officials from my Department was established last April to examine the issue and provide advice to employers on addressing potential shortfalls. Workforce planners in each health board are liaising with directors of nursing and human resource managers to ensure the sufficient staffing resources are available during the period from late 2005 to autumn 2006.</P>

	<P>Following the Medical Council&rsquo;s investigation into the conduct of Dr. Michael Neary, which found him guilty of professional misconduct in relation to ten patients, the Government decided to establish a non-statutory <Col N="490"/>inquiry chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clarke.</P>
        <P>Terms of reference were agreed by Government and the inquiry commenced its work in May 2004. The format and terms of reference for the inquiry were the subject of detailed discussion with Patient Focus, which is a patient advocacy group that represents former patients of Dr. Neary. In broad terms, the inquiry is examining the rate of peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, with particular reference to the period covered in the report of the Fitness to Practise Committee of the Medical Council relating to Dr. Michael Neary and the period since the publication of that report. The inquiry will seek to establish how this rate compared with the rate in other maternity units of similar status. It will also inquire into whether Dr. Neary&rsquo;s practice was commented or acted upon by others at the hospital and examine whether <Col N="491"/>internal or external reviews were conducted. The inquiry will also report on the measures put in place to prevent a repeat of those events at the hospital and offer advice on any additional systems that should be put in place.</P>
        <P>The inquiry team has already examined a substantial amount of documents and records which relate to the inquiry. It has conducted over 100 interviews to date with patients, Medical Missionaries of Mary sisters, both consultant and non-consultant doctors, midwives, nurses, theatre staff and non-medical personnel from the hospital. The inquiry has been asked to report within a nine month timescale.</P>

To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years. The central aim is to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. I will be advised by the chief medical officer of my Department in relation to the location of radiation oncology services in the eastern region and by other experts in the area. The chief medical officer is being assisted by a panel of international experts in this regard.</P>
        <P>A detailed request for proposals issued to six hospitals in Dublin on 24 June 2004. The document set out extensive information requirements including details of current oncology services provision, approach to the organisation of radiation oncology service provision, capital and revenue requirements, transport options for outpatient and day-case patients, education, training, quality systems and research. The document also set out the evaluation criteria against which the proposals will be assessed as follows: overall quality of the proposal; quality of current cancer service delivery; quality of proposed integrated cancer service delivery, to include radiation oncology; commitment to research, education and training; <Col N="492"/>suitability of site to accommodate radiation oncology and related services, including timelines for construction and capital costs; and costs, taking into account revenue costs, both pay and non-pay and staffing requirements.</P>
        <P>A further breakdown of these criteria was agreed by the international panel and issued to all hospitals on 22 September 2004 to assist hospitals in finalising their proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 8 October 2004 and six hospitals submitted proposals on that date. The international panel is currently examining the proposals in detail in preparation for its meetings with hospitals which will take place during the week beginning 13 December 2004. I expect to receive the advice of the international panel by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency, CPA, published a piece of research, entitled Contraception Needs: The Evidence, A Literature Review. The research, and not the CPA, recommended that some consideration be given to making contraceptive services available free of charge, and to deregulating emergency contraception in order to increase access to women in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The director of the CPA has advised my Department that the recommendations in this research will be considered by the agency in the first instance, as part of the development of an overall framework for contraceptive services due to be completed next year.</P>
        <P>Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services to all persons in their area who need such services; these services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals-units. Significant additional funding, &euro;5.73 million, was provided for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services between 1999 and 2002.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the question of licensing any medicinal product, along with the conditions attached to any such product placed on the market and made available to the public, are matters for the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, in the first instance. The IMB is obliged to review all the evidence on the quality, safety and efficacy <Col N="493"/>of the product concerned when examining an application for a product authorisation; the question of the legal classification appropriate to the product would also be considered.</P>

	<P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, plays a key role in relation to the prevention and management of infectious diseases in this country.</P>
        <P>The Irish approach to infectious diseases outbreaks is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as preventative measures; early identification of cases; effective clinical care including good hospital infection control; appropriate surveillance; and, contact tracing and management of contacts. The procedures for dealing with infectious diseases are based on these principles.</P>
        <P>The NDSC monitors the avian influenza situation in Asia on an ongoing basis through the World Health Organisation, WHO.</P>
        <P>In line with advice from WHO, it is recommended that Irish travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza infection should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. In addition, there are no restrictions on travel to any country currently experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 avian infection in poultry flocks, including countries, which have also reported cases in humans. This is also in line with WHO travel recommendations.</P>
        <P>In addition, the following actions have been undertaken: interim Irish guidelines on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza, Influenza A-H5, have been circulated to all health care professionals and are also posted on the NDSC website; guidance in the form of a SARS and avian influenza clinical management algorithm has been circulated to hospitals and clinicians on the appropriate management of travellers with an influenza-like illness who have returned from east or Southeast Asia, that is, areas where avian influenza outbreaks are occurring. This will assist in early detection of any influenza A/H5 cases</P>

	<P>I am aware of the recent article published by the ESRI to which the Deputy refers. It concludes that when current and capital spending are aggregated, OECD data places Irish public spending <i>per capita</i> at 101.4% of the EU average in 2002.</P>
        <P>The author has indicated that in her view if all community welfare programme and disability programme spending were excluded to make Irish figures more comparable to that of other EU countries, the Irish <i>per capita</i>  spend for 2002 would be below the EU average at 96%. However the figure of 101.4% quoted above was based on figures agreed between my Department and the OECD and is therefore the best comparator available at present.</P>

	<P>There is no Government embargo on the recruitment of nurses. The chief executive officer of each individual health board has responsibility for the management of the workforce, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed within that board, in line with service plan priorities, subject to the overall employment levels remaining within the authorised ceiling.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertakes a quarterly national survey of nursing resources. The most recent survey reported that the recruitment of additional nurses continued to be a prominent feature of activity with a net increase of 563 nurses in the system in the year ended 30 June 2004.</P>
        <P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures fluctuate over time and may arise for a variety of reasons such as ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures.</P>

	<P>Staphylococcus aureus, often referred to simply as &ldquo;staph&rdquo;, are bacteria commonly carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people. Occasionally, &ldquo;staph&rdquo; can cause infections &mdash; such bacteria are one of the most common causes of skin infections. Most of the infections are minor, such as pimples or boils and most can be treated without antibiotics. However, these bacteria can also cause serious infections, such as surgical wound infections and pneumonia. In the past, most serious &ldquo;staph&rdquo; infections were treated with antibiotics related to penicillin. Over the past 50 years, treatment of these infections has become more difficult because &ldquo;staph&rdquo; bacteria have become resistant to various antibiotics, antimicrobials. MRSA, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus. The proportion of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia caused by MRSA in Ireland in 2002 was 42.7%.</P>
        <P>I note that the Deputy has asked for the number of MRSA cases. This is a somewhat misleading term, as MRSA is not a disease but rather a bacteria that can cause a wide range of infections. Indeed, most people who acquire MRSA do not develop any infection and simply carry the bacteria without any symptoms. To try to routinely measure all of the various types of infection that can be caused by MRSA and to determine whether or not they are clinically significant would be an enormous undertaking; even if an attempt were made to try to measure all MRSA cases, there are no comparative data as this is not something that is routinely done at a national level in most countries.</P>
        <P>MRSA bacteraemia is used as a measure for two reasons: first, it is a reliable indicator of significant MRSA infection and, second, it is the same standardised measure of MRSA infection that is used by most other countries, for example, the UK, the USA, etc.</P>
        <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, collects data from hospitals on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or blood poisoning, as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, EARSS. Ireland has the highest level of participation of any country involved in EARSS and EARSS data in Ireland represent at least 95% of the population; thus the EARSS data for Ireland approximates the true total number of cases of MRSA bacteraemia in Ireland. In 2003, there were 477 cases of MRSA bacteraemia reported in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, was launched in June 2001. Since then, approximately &euro;16 million in <Col N="496"/>funding has been made available by my Department to health boards under the strategy. Much of this funding is designated for improving hospital infrastructure for control of infection and for appointing the additional microbiologists, infection control nurses and other health care professionals required for effective control of infection in hospitals.</P>
        <P>At national level, MRSA bacteraemia is now included in the revised list of notifiable diseases of the infectious diseases regulations, so hospitals are now legally required to report cases of serious MRSA infection to health board departments of public health and to the NDSC. The reporting process for MRSA bacteraemia remains the same for now, that is direct reporting to the NDSC via the EARSS protocol, as this has proven extremely effective.</P>
        <P>MRSA infection is generally confined to hospitals and, in particular, to vulnerable or debilitated patients. These include patients in intensive care units and on surgical or orthopaedic wards. MRSA does not generally pose a risk to hospital staff, unless they are suffering from a debilitating disease, or family members of an affected patient or their close social or work contacts. MRSA does not harm healthy people, including pregnant women, children and babies. MRSA can affect people who have certain long-term health problems. Visitors to patients with MRSA infection should be advised by the local nursing-medical staff to wash their hands thoroughly after visiting patients so as to avoid spreading MRSA.</P>
        <P>Infection with Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA bacteria can be prevented by practising good hygiene, namely, keeping hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water; keeping cuts and abrasions clean and covered with a proper dressing, that is, bandage, until healed; and, avoiding contact with other people&rsquo;s wounds or material contaminated by wounds.</P>
        <P>Hand hygiene is a key component in the control of MRSA and the SARI infection control sub-committee has just released national guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings. These guidelines have been widely circulated by the NDSC and are available on the NDSC&rsquo;s website. The SARI national committee has set the implementation of these guidelines as a priority for the coming year.</P>
        <P>Each health board-authority region has a regional SARI committee and these committees have been developing regional interventions to control hospital infection, including MRSA.</P>
        <P>In 1995, my Department prepared a set of guidelines in relation to MRSA. These guidelines have been widely circulated and include an information leaflet for patients. The SARI infection control sub-committee is currently updating national guidelines on the control of MRSA in health care settings. A draft version of these guidelines is being distributed for consultation in the coming week and will also be available on the <Col N="497"/>NDSC website. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness and overcrowding, sufficient isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use, early detection of MRSA through surveillance and laboratory detection of MRSA. The implementation of these guidelines will require further essential staff and improved hospital infrastructure, as outlined in the SARI report, and an acceptance of corporate responsibility for infection control at senior hospital and health board level.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of drug treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
        <P>To address the problem of drug misuse, health boards provide a wide range of drug addiction services including outreach, education, treatment, rehabilitation and community welfare in line with the actions set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. Furthermore, the health boards fund and co-ordinate a broad range of services provided by voluntary and community sector organisations. Additional annual funding provided to health boards for drug treatment services since 1997 amounts to &euro;52 million. This funding has allowed for the employment of over 730 staff in the drug addiction services and for the expansion of services. Since 2002 alone an additional &euro;9.721 million has been allocated to health boards. Funding is provided for the treatment of all drug users abusing all types of drugs and is not broken down by a specific type of drug. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, there are currently 59 drug treatment locations. This is an increase of 47 locations since 1996. Outside the ERHA, seven treatment clinics have been established.</P>
        <P>With regard to prevalence of opiate use, research conducted by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, last year estimated that there were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland in 2001. In comparing the estimates for Dublin for the year 1996 with those for the year 2001, there appears to be a decrease of approximately 1,000 in the prevalence of opiate users. <Col N="498"/>There are no comparative figures for the regions outside Dublin as they were not included in the 1996 study.</P>
        <P>The numbers in treatment for heroin use outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, area have increased significantly between 1998 and 2002. This is in line with one of the key actions in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 which is to increase the number of treatment places available for drug misusers. At the end of September 2004, 7114 people were receiving methadone treatment. Based on the NACD figures, we can say that around half the people who misuse opiates are in treatment, a very high proportion by international standards.</P>
        <P>Regional drugs task forces have been established in all health boards and are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as the range and level of existing services with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision of services. It is expected that these reports and actions plans will be received and considered by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, in the coming months.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the programme for Government calls for the monitoring of the use of heroin, particularly outside Dublin and in this regard the NACD are currently establishing an early warning system to address this issue.</P>
        <P>As part of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, which is being conducted by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current extent and pattern of drug misuse is being examined and any gaps will be identified and addressed.</P>
        <P>In relation to needle exchange, I am informed that the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, the South Western Area Health Board, SWAHB, and the East Coast Area Health Board, ECAHB, offer harm reduction programmes including needle exchange from fixed sites, mobile units and outreach work. Outreach workers frequently practise &ldquo;backpacking&rdquo; a process whereby staff, in the absence of a local clinic or mobile unit, carry supplies of drug-taking paraphernalia for distribution to known drug misusers. Additional services operate from Merchant's Quay Project, and other sites in the greater Dublin area run in partnership by the three area health boards of the ERHA and a number of voluntary organisations.</P>

The team reported to my Department this year and its proposals for the development of a new Central Mental Hospital, including the future location of the hospital, are currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The majority of admissions to the Central Mental Hospital come from within the prison service. Accordingly, ease of access between the main Dublin prisons and the hospital would be of importance and I understand that the location of the hospital adjacent to a prison would have operational benefits for the prison service. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the Central Mental Hospital is a therapeutic, health care facility. I fully agree with families and carers who feel that it would not be desirable that the hospital be perceived as, or closely identified with, a prison complex.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has advanced proposals to develop a new prison complex replacing Mountjoy. I recognise the potential benefits of close co-operation between that project and the re-development of the Central Mental Hospital and I will be asking my officials to consider how the matter might be progressed to the mutual benefit of both services.</P>

This funding has allowed for the employment of over 730 staff in the drug addiction services and for the expansion of services. Since 2002 alone an additional &euro;9.721 million has been allocated to health boards. Funding is provided for the treatment of all drug users abusing all types of drugs and is not broken down by a specific type of drug. In the Eastern <Col N="501"/>Regional Authority, ERHA, there are currently 59 drug treatment locations. This is an increase of 47 locations since 1996. Outside the ERHA, seven treatment clinics have been established.</P>
        <P>The addiction services in the ERHA provide a range of services to those presenting with problem cocaine use. The treatment methodologies utilised for those with primary cocaine addiction are evidence based and are in line with best practice internationally. The services are focused on psychological support, counselling interventions and referral to appropriate residential services.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that only a small number of individuals are presenting for treatment for cocaine misuse alone, the majority of service users presenting with problem cocaine use are individuals involved in poly drug misuse, particularly opiate misuse, and their cocaine use is treated in the context of their overall treatment plan.</P>
        <P>In addition to the drug treatment services outlined above, a provocative and targeted multi-media advertising campaign to help correct misinformation about recreational cocaine use has been launched earlier this month as part of the national drugs awareness campaign. The campaign is managed by the health promotion unit in my Department in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown local drugs task force.</P>
        <P>The core message of this phase of the national campaign is, &ldquo;There is no fairytale ending with cocaine&rdquo;, and it uses the device of nursery rhyme characters such as Jack and Jill and Georgie Porgie to illustrate the stark facts about the psychological, physical, sexual and financial problems that can arise from using cocaine as a recreational drug. The campaign is aimed at 18 to 35 year olds and is designed to disprove some of the common urban myths surrounding cocaine use.</P>
        <P>The campaign features three individual advertisements placed in the restrooms of entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs throughout Ireland and is supported by print advertisements in selected national newspapers and magazines, beer mats and free postcards. The campaign will run for six months including over the Christmas party season. The campaign is also supported by a special &ldquo;micro-site&rdquo; on cocaine on a website which explains in detail the negative effects of cocaine use. Health boards will continue to work to develop new initiatives to respond to the cocaine problem.</P>

	<P>I welcome the publication of the evidence-based report, Youth Suicide Prevention, which was researched by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, the programme of action for children and the health development agency. The information contained in this report will provide invaluable material for all those working in the area of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. It will also inform the work that is now underway on the preparation of a strategic action plan for suicide reduction. This strategy, involving the health boards executive, HeBE, in partnership with the national suicide review group and supported by the Department of Health and Children will build on existing policy and on the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on suicide. All measures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by suicide will be considered in the preparation of this strategy.</P>
        <P>My Department has given special attention over the past number of years to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives. Since the publication of the task force report in 1998, a cumulative total of more than &euro;17.5 million has been provided since towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This year more than &euro;4.5 million is available to the various agencies working towards reducing the level of suicide and attempted suicide in this country. This includes the health boards, the national suicide review group, the Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation.</P>
        <P>The task force report recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. In this regard, additional funding has been made available in recent years to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Significant additional funding has also been provided for many voluntary organisations who deal with people suffering from depression, mental illness and bereavement who are at risk of suicide and attempted suicide.</P>
        <P>I share the public concern about the level of suicides in this country and I am fully committed to the intensification of suicide prevention measures and research programmes.</P>

	<P>The health service reform programme announced by the Government in June <Col N="504"/>2003 is primarily based on the recommendations of the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service, the Brennan report, and the audit of structures and functions in the health system, the Prospectus report, together with the report of the national taskforce on medical staffing, the Hanly report. Work is well advanced on the implementation of the Brennan report as part of the overall health service reform programme.</P>
        <P>A number of key bodies central to the reform programme are now in place and working to advance the implementation of the reform programme. The national steering committee, which I chair, is overseeing the implementation of the work programme. The Cabinet committee on health, chaired by the Taoiseach, ensures that the Government is kept fully informed on all important issues.</P>
        <P>The health service reform programme will consolidate the multiplicity of different structures within a single agency, the Health Service Executive, HSE. I propose to submit a new Health Bill to Government shortly which will deal with the establishment of the HSE.</P>
        <P>On 26 November 2003 the Minister for Health and Children announced the establishment of the interim board of the Health Service Executive. The interim HSE was established as a statutory body on foot of SI 90/04 on 9 March 2004. Under the establishment order, the interim HSE has been given the task of drawing up a plan for the transition to a unitary delivery system. The interim executive has also been given the task of making the necessary preparations to implement this plan, subject to ministerial approval, so as to ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the existing management, administrative and service delivery structures of the health boards to the new health service executive structure.</P>
        <P>Thirteen action projects which were put in place to develop specific aspects of the reforms, reported on schedule in December 2003. A composite report collating individual action committee reports was prepared and disseminated.</P>
        <P>The Health (Amendment) Act 2004, which provided for the abolition of the membership of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards was commenced on 15 June. The Act also repealed the provisions providing for the appointment of members to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area health boards and health boards. The enormous and complex nature of the reforms requires work across the whole spectrum of organisational change. Significant work is continuing on a broad number of fronts including: the interim Health Service Executive has announced the appointment of Professor Aidan Halligan as the first chief executive officer of the HSE and arrangements to recruit other senior management of the HSE are well advanced; a draft revised organisation design for the restructured Department of Health and Children has been completed; my Department and the interim <Col N="505"/>HSE financial transition team are working on appropriate transition arrangements to lay the groundwork for the implementation of a number of the recommendations of the Brennan report; health boards have recently submitted draft service plans to the interim HSE to facilitate the drafting of the national service plan for 2005 - this, with associated performance indicators, will help provide a robust monitoring and evaluation framework; work on a broad range of human resource and industrial relations matters is continuing through the agreed structures; Mr. Pat McGrath, group managing director of the project management group, was appointed as the chairperson of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on 28 September. I will be announcing the board of HIQA in the near future; work is progressing in relation to agencies designated for streamlining into the HSE in the short term. The interim HSE has been liaising closely on the matter with the agencies concerned, namely, the Health Boards Executive, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Office for Health Management, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the GMS (Payments) Board; the boundaries of the HSE&rsquo;s four primary, community and continuing care regions were announced on 28 September; and work is well advanced on drafting an interim code of governance for the health service.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements will provide a stronger national focus for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. The implementation of the reform programme will result in a less fragmented and more accountable system, as envisaged by the Brennan report.</P>

        <P>It is not possible to give a breakdown of the numbers of persons to whom medical cards were allocated under the Government decision, in respect of statutory automatic eligibility for persons aged 70 years and over which came into effect from 1 July 2001, in the manner requested by the Deputies. Since that date persons, in this age category, no longer have to give details of their income to the local health board at the time of their application for a medical card. Applications for medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over are made on simplified application forms which are accompanied by proof of age. However, the number of persons who are covered with the &rsquo;higher rate&rsquo; medical card as opposed to those on the ordinary rate card gives a close approximation of the figures. The following table outlines the position in relation to the number of persons aged 70 years and over who held and were covered by a medical card for October 2004 and June 2001.</P><Col N="507"/>

	<P>Recently published data from the national cancer registry Ireland has shown that there is an increase in age standardised incidence rates by approximately 6% per year during the period 1994 to 2000. It is important to note that age standardised mortality rates over the same period have been falling by about 1% per year. The increase in incidence may reflect increased rates of prostate cancer testing in Ireland in recent years. The national cancer registry Ireland, together with the Northern Ireland cancer registry are about to commence a two year study on prostate cancer, which will provide more detailed information on the relationship between prostate cancer testing and incidence trends. Appropriate treatment services are available regionally for patients with prostate cancer. Any man who is concerned about prostate cancer should contact his general practitioner.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that no such negotiations with health care insurers have taken place and that it would not be feasible to bring forward regulations given the differences in the health systems in these countries.</P>
        <P>Currently the operation of private health insurance in this country is subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2003, and incorporates community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. The legislation requires all health insurers to operate on a &ldquo;open enrolment&rdquo; basis, in addition to offering community-rated health insurance. Insurers are obliged to make cover available to all persons, including returning emigrants, who are under the age of 65 regardless of whether or not they were previously covered, subject to prescribed waiting periods. Generally, insurers are entitled to apply an initial waiting period of 26 weeks in respect of persons aged under 55 and 52 weeks in respegt of those aged 55 or over, prior to health insurance cover becoming fully effective. In addition, insurers are entitled to apply longer waiting periods in relation to pre-existing conditions.</P>
        <P>Insurers participating in the Irish market are not obliged to offer cover to persons aged 65 and over, unless they were covered in a former health insurance contract with a registered health insurer, which had expired less than 13 weeks previously. Allowing insurers discretion to apply waiting periods and on whether to accept new applicants aged 65 and over is considered a necessary protection in a community-rated open enrolment environment and supports the principle of inter-generational solidarity.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001 contains provision for the introduction of a system of &ldquo;lifetime community rating&rdquo; which will involve allowing health insurers to apply late entry premium loadings to persons who delay taking out insurance cover until, or after, the age of 35 years, thereby strengthening community rating. Under this system, access to cover will be open to persons aged 65 or over. While the primary legislation is in place, the detailed implementation of lifetime community rating will be by way of secondary legislation. My Department has initiated work on the preparation of these regulations and they will be introduced as soon as is practicable. The introduction of these regulations will broaden the scope for those persons aged 65 and over who come to live in Ireland from abroad to avail of health insurance cover.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>A forum on fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum report&rsquo;s main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>The report of the forum on fluoridation made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, policy and technical aspects of fluoridation and the establishment of an expert body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations. The expert body, to be known as the Irish expert body on fluorides and health, was set up earlier this year. The terms of reference of the expert body are: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his-her request or on its own initiative.</P>
        <P>The expert body has broad representation, including from the areas of public health medicine, engineering, management, environmental protection, environmental health, dentistry, and health promotion. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the body has a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests, in addition to the necessary scientific, managerial and public health inputs. The expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride.</P>

	<P>The total funding provided for the health services in the Revised Estimates Volume 2004 was &euro;10.08 billion. This provided for &euro;9,570 million current funding, a rise of 9% over the outturn 2003, and &euro;510 million capital funding, approximately. Since 2001 the total increase in the Health Estimate has been &euro;1,093 million, <Col N="510"/>based on Revised Estimates 2002. This increase in funding has allowed the health services to address care areas outlined in the programme for Government 2002 and the health strategy 2001, such as acute hospitals, disability services and services for older people, progressing towards the highest quality of care for service users. Discussions are continuing between the Minister for Finance and myself in regard to the 2005 Estimates.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, my Department requested health boards to provide it with detailed schedules of all proposals regarding planned disposal of property. The sale of assets in the health area will be used for health purposes, with the exception of a contribution towards social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>The information received from the health boards in response to this request is being examined at present. Among the matters to be considered in this context is the fulfilment of my Department&rsquo;s obligations in respect of the provision of lands for affordable housing. I believe it would be inappropriate to provide further details in advance of the completion of this process.</P>
        <P>With regard to establishing the extent of the total surplus properties available to the health services, it will be necessary to carry out a professional assessment/evaluation of the entire health estate.

	<P>The Government is committed to implementing the Hanly report in a way that will command the confidence of people in each region. Implementation of some of the report&rsquo;s key proposals has been hampered by industrial <Col N="511"/>action taken by hospital consultants. My predecessor appointed implementation groups in the two phase 1 regions, and an acute hospitals review group to develop a national hospitals plan. These groups have not been able to meet due to the non-participation of consultants.</P>
        <P>Work on other elements of the Hanly proposals is progressing. Detailed assessments have been prepared of the service and resource implications of the forthcoming reduction in non-consultant hospital doctors&rsquo;, NCHDs, working hours in each health agency. Negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on the reduction in NCHD hours required under the European working time directive are continuing in the Labour Relations Commission. Local implementation groups for this purpose are being established in eight hospitals as part of an agreed pilot process.</P>
        <P>The sub-group of the national task force on medical staffing which dealt with medical education and training issues has remained in place. The group has been asked to examine and report to me on the measures required to accommodate NCHD training in all postgraduate programmes and safeguard both training and service delivery during the transition to a 48-hour working week. The group has agreed a joint approach to training with the medical training bodies and the Medical Council, and has provided formal advice on the provision of medical education and training in a 58-hour working week.</P>
        <P>Consultant contract negotiations are paused pending resolution of issues related to medical indemnity arrangements. However, significant preparatory work has been undertaken in anticipation of substantive negotiations with the medical organisations.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s decision of June 2003 on the health services reform programme, will consolidate the multiplicity of different structures within a single agency, the Health Service Executive, HSE. To that end, I propose to submit a new Health Bill to Government shortly which will deal with the establishment of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The new Health Bill will also provide for the establishment of regional forums by me as the Minister for Health and Children, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Members will be nominated to the forums by the city and county councils in each forum&rsquo;s functional area. <Col N="512"/>The objective of the regional forums will be to enable informed dialogue and consultation between the Health Service Executive and the public at local level. The operation of the regional forums will complement the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system.</P>
        <P>The board of the interim Health Service Executive was set up last November.  Under its establishment order, the interim executive has responsibility, subject to ministerial approval, to plan the establishment of a national unified structure for the delivery of health services. This includes responsibility for the integration of the management, administrative and service delivery structures of the health boards.</P>
        <P>The Government decision provided that the primary, continuing and community care directorate, to be established within the HSE, would be supported by a network of four regional health offices, and the existing community care areas based on 32 local health offices.</P>
        <P>On foot of proposals from the interim Health Service Executive, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on 28 September 2004 jointly announced with Mr. Kevin Kelly, executive chairman of the interim HSE, the four regional areas of the HSE.</P>
        <P>As proposed by the interim Health Service Executive, the local health office will be the primary service delivery unit in each community, and the regional health offices will co-ordinate services where they span more than one local area and will be responsible for performance management, translating national policies through the local areas and gathering and relaying information on a regional basis. Interaction with local communities and their elected public representatives will also be a part of their functions. It is envisaged that they will employ somewhere in the region of 25 to 35 staff.</P>

	<P>A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in October 2000 and is available to eligible women resident in the Mid-Western Health Board region. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, on a structured call and recall basis, at five year intervals. All women in the age cohort are eligible to avail of the programme.</P>
        <P>The aim of the cervical screening programme is to detect abnormal pre-cancerous conditions in asymptotic women which, if left untreated, may become cancerous. To date, 45,000 women have <Col N="513"/>availed of screening. The vast majority of women participating are aged 25-44 years.</P>

	<P>In Ireland, immunisation uptake is routinely calculated on a quarterly basis among children at 12 and 24 months of age. The latest figures available from the National Disease Sur<Col N="514"/>veillance Centre for immunisation uptake relate to the second quarter of 2004. The statistics relate to children who have received three doses of vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib &mdash; Haemophilus Influenzae Type B, polio, and meningococcal group C; and one dose of vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella, MMR1.</P>
        <P>In Quarter 2, 2004, the national uptake rate for vaccines against diptheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib and polio was 88-89% at 24 months &mdash; Table 1. The uptake rate for menC vaccine was 87% and the uptake rate for MMR1 was 81%. Two health boards reached the target rate of 95% uptake for diptheria and tetanus. One of these health boards also reached the target rate of 95% for pertussis and polio.</P><Col N="513"/>

        <P FLI="0">Uptake, particularly in relation to MMR, falls short of the national target of 95%. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of non-immunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
        <P>There is concern among some parents in relation to the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, the MMR vaccine discussion pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents, was launched. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the Department of Public Health, Southern Health Board, and was published by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for <Col N="514"/>parents. The pack is set out in question and answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn&rsquo;s disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack enables health professionals to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, since the introduction of the national immunisation programme against group C meningococcal disease in October 2000 there has been a dramatic reduction in this disease in Ireland. The aim of this programme was to immunise all children and young people up to the age of 22 against the disease. Data provided by the NDSC indicates that between January and September 2004 five cases of the disease were notified compared to 121 cases in the same period in 2000, a reduction of 96%. This represents a very significant reduction and highlights the importance and success of the campaign.</P>
        <P>The health board CEOs established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups, which examined the following areas in relation to immu<Col N="515"/>nisation: (a) communication; (b) materials management; (c) IT systems; and (d) planning and organisation.</P>
        <P>The report of the steering committee was launched in April 2002. This report is an important step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. In July 2003, a national immunisation implementation group was established and is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake. This group reports to the national steering committee.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of proposals in relation to childhood immunisation which were submitted by the national implementation group through the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, on behalf of the health boards, &euro;2.116 million was allocated by my Department in 2003 to fund initiatives to improve childhood immunisation uptake. A further &euro;2.778 million has been allocated for that purpose this year. Funding in the region of &euro;800,000 has been allocated to health boards via HeBE specifically for regional and localised projects which will focus on measures to improve immunisation uptake.</P>
        <P>In 2003, CEOs in all health boards and the ERHA were asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions in order to prevent a serious measles outbreak. Health boards have undertaken a range of measures in their regions to improve vaccine uptake in their region. These include: information sessions for professionals, for example, doctors and nurses in the area; information sessions for parents; distribution of information to the public e.g. leaflets on MMR available in public areas; advertisements taken out in local papers; advertisements on local radio stations; advice regarding immunisation, including MMR, forms part of every public health nurse consultation with parents; information leaflets displayed prominently in all health centres; information given to schools regarding the booster MMR; follow up of parents by letter and telephone where children have not been vaccinated; follow up with GPs and nurses regarding children in their area who have not been vaccinated; and information sessions for staff.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

For that reason mental health is a resource that needs to be protected and promoted.</P>
        <P>An expert group on mental health policy has recently been set up to develop a national policy framework for mental health. On foot of submissions made to the expert group, a sub-group on mental health promotion and the prevention <Col N="517"/>of mental ill-health has been established to examine the issues around the promotion of positive mental health. It is envisaged that the group will make recommendations, based on best practice and current policy, for the inclusion for mental health promotion and prevention of mental ill health in the new national policy framework, as well as identifying and recommending priority areas for action. The expert group is due to report in 2005.</P>

	<P>The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board-authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The last such increase was notified in January 2004.</P>
        <P>For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of that condition free of charges. Under the drug pay<Col N="518"/>ments scheme, a person and his-her dependants will not have to pay more than &euro;78 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
        <P>Health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding food derived from genetically modified organisms, GMOs, generally referred to as GM food. This includes the enforcement of food labelling provisions for which the FSAI carries out checks on the market place for compliance.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>Ireland, in common with other member states and as required by EU rules, applies EU legislation on GM foods. EU legislation on GM foods is in the form of EU regulations which are directly applicable to and binding on each member state. My Department is currently working on introducing measures into national legislation which will allow for enforcement measures including penalties in the case of non-compliance with the recently adopted EU regulations.</P>
        <P>The regulation on GM food and feed &mdash; EC No. 1829/2003 &mdash; shifts the basis for labelling from presence-detection of genetically modified DNA or protein, to apply to any products produced or derived from GM material, regardless of the presence-detectability of genetically modified material. In order to ensure the practicability and feasibility of this regulation, a labelling threshold applies to foods containing material which contains, consists of or is produced from GMOs. The threshold applies to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of authorised genetically modified material in a proportion no higher than 0.9 % of the food ingredients considered individually or food consisting of a single ingredient.</P>
        <P>This threshold recognises that despite the fact that some operators avoid using GMOs, such material may gain access to conventional food and feed in minute traces as a result of adventitious or technically unavoidable co-mingling during production, cultivation, harvest, transport, storage or processing.</P>
        <P>The FSAI has in the past identified certain products bearing labels identifying the product as GM-free when in fact a level of GM was present, albeit lower than the 0.9% threshold. Currently the FSAI is specifically examining foods carrying GM-free type labels with a view to the authenticity of such labels. Article 2 of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, provides that labelling must not mislead the purchaser as to the characteristics of the foodstuff and in particular, as to its nature, identity, properties, composition, method of production and manufacturing. The use of GM-free type labelling is voluntary and legal when no GM ingredients are present in a food where GM ingredients could be found. However, it is not legal under the general labelling directive to label something as GM-free when there is actually no GM variety of that food or ingredient available as this could mislead the purchaser. For example, labelling milk as GM free is not legal since there is no GM milk available. The views of the FSAI on GM-free labels and the actions taken to address the problem have received the support of many other member states and the European Commission at Standing Committee level.</P><Col N="520"/>
        <P>The FSAI is actively engaging with retailers to address the problem of foods inaccurately labelled as GM-free, an approach that is also being used in addressing other labelling inaccuracies. This approach places the onus on the retailer to remove specific affected batches from the shelves and to liaise with their suppliers in order to either rectify any labelling inaccuracies or have that product line restricted or discontinued. In this way inaccurate labelling can be more quickly addressed without the immediate need for legal action which would tie up scarce resources for long periods.</P>
        <P>The FSAI is constantly engaged in educating industry as to the implications of the recent changes in EU regulations on GMOs, including the issue of labelling. To this end, and in conjunction with Departments and industry organisations, the FSAI is formulating a guidance note for industry which will highlight the impact of the legislation with regard to GMOs and all derived products.</P>
        <P>It must be stressed that no product consisting of, containing or derived from GMOs can be authorised for marketing without first having undergone the appropriate safety assessment. Consequently, I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of authorised GM foods, or foods containing GM ingredients placed on the market in Ireland. Consumer safety and consumer choice are paramount in the approach taken to GM foods, as reflected in the extent of the legislation developed to deal with this sensitive area. Government policy on GM foods is based on the advice that no credible evidence has yet been provided to show that GM foods pose a risk to human health.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the European Commission decision to authorise the marketing of a genetically modified form of sweetcorn, thus ending the six-year ban on new genetically modified foods in the EU; her further views on the consequences of this decision for the marketing of more genetically modified foods throughout the EU; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On 19 May 2004, the European Commission authorised the placing on the market of sweetcorn from genetically modified maize line Bt11. The significance of this decision is that granting the approval in this case ended an almost six year <i>de facto</i> moratorium during which no new GM events, be they food, feed or the deliberate release of crops, were approved within the EU.</P>
        <P>This decision taken by the Commission was the result of the decision making process known as comitology. In order to grant Community authorisation, a draft Commission decision was submitted to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health on 8 December 2003. <Col N="521"/> However the necessary qualified majority was not achieved. Under comitology rules it was then necessary for the Commission to put forward a proposal to Council for a vote on the application. If Council were to fail to come to a decision or fail to act on the proposal within three months of having received it the proposal would then revert back to the Commission for a decision. The proposal was put on the agenda of the Agriculture Council on April 26 in order for Council to meet its obligation to act before the end of April 2004. However, the Agriculture Council did not achieve a qualified majority either for or against the proposal. Consequently, on 19 May 2004, the European Commission authorised the placing on the market of sweet corn from genetically modified maize line Bt11.</P>
        <P>Ireland, represented by the Department of Health and Children at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and by the Department of Agriculture and Food at the Agriculture Council, supported this proposal. Ireland&rsquo;s decision to support the proposal was taken after consultation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and was based on the scientific risk assessment undertaken on this product, initially by the Netherlands&rsquo; food assessment body and subsequently by the EU Scientific Committee on Food which concluded that Bt11 sweet maize is as safe for human food use as conventional sweet maize.</P>
        <P>The FSAI is the competent authority in Ireland for the legislation governing GM food. It does not give blanket approval to GM foods but individually evaluates, on its own merits, each application to place a new GM food on the EU market. The FSAI is satisfied that based on the best scientific evidence available, all of the GM foods and ingredients currently on the EU market are as safe as those derived from their non-GM counterparts.</P>
        <P>The authorisation of Bt11 follows upon the introduction in November 2003, of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on GM Food and Feed which replaces the GM part of the Novel Food Regulation (EC) No 258/97, and heralded the completion of the new tranche of EU legislation in the area of GMOs. The objective of this regulation, in accordance with the general principles laid down in European food safety legislation, is to provide the basis for ensuring a high level of protection of human life and health, animal health and welfare, environment and consumer interests in relation to GM food and feed, while ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market. Also introduced at that time was Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 on traceability and labelling of GMOs and traceability of food and feed produced from GMOs. The objective of this regulation is to provide for an improved labelling and traceability framework for GM-food and GM-feed and came into effect in April 2004. It aims to respond to citizens&rsquo; demands for more and better information on GMOs, and the need <Col N="522"/>to facilitate the freedom of choice between new and more traditional food products. There are eight current applications for authorisation of GM foods. It is expected that of these eight, only maize lines NK603, GA21 and MON 863 will follow the approvals procedure under Regulation (EC) No. 258/97. Any future applications will follow the approvals procedure set out under Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003.</P>

	<P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, plays a key role in relation to the prevention and management of infectious diseases in this country. Information provided by the NDSC indicates that salmonella Newport is an uncommon variety of salmonella. It accounts for about 1-2% of all salmonella infection in Europe but it is responsible for a considerably higher proportion of infection in the United States. It produces the same symptoms as other strains of salmonella including diarrhoea, vomiting and fever. Most cases of illness are mild and short lived, if unpleasant. While a significant minority of cases are ill enough to require hospitalisation, life-threatening illness and death are rare. Salmonella infection usually results from undercooked foods, especially eggs, poultry and pork, or by cross-contamination from raw to prepared food.</P>
        <P>The current outbreak of salmonella Newport in the United Kingdom came to light when an increase in this relatively rare salmonella was noticed by the UK Health Protection Agency, HPA. The authorities have established epidemiological evidence indicating that the illness has been associated with consumption of lettuce from restaurants, fast food and take away premises. However, this has not been confirmed by identification of the bacteria from food samples analysed.</P>
        <P>In response to evidence which suggested that the lettuce implicated in the UK outbreak was supplied to catering premises only and not to retail traders, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland took the precautionary step of issuing detailed advice to caterers preparing lettuce. Food businesses were also reminded of the need to maintain good hand washing practices and hygiene practices in kitchens in order to minimise the risk of causing this type of illness.</P>
        <P>The NDSC and the interim national salmonella reference laboratory in Galway have been monitoring the situation closely. One case of salmon<Col N="523"/>ella Newport, associated with the United Kingdom outbreak, has been diagnosed in the Republic of Ireland. The patient, a resident of the Republic of Ireland, had consumed food in Northern Ireland and the illness was diagnosed on returning home. Two other cases of Salmonella Newport earlier in the year in the Republic of Ireland were associated with overseas travel and are not part of the United Kingdom outbreak.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, was established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment &mdash; PPF3.10.11.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority, on behalf of the working group, and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of such a payment in Ireland. The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of the disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs. The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was published by the NDA early in 2004.</P>
        <P>The working group produced a position paper in March this year, which gave an overview of the work it had undertaken. It outlined the group&rsquo;s current thinking and also gave an indication of the next steps the group intends taking. The working group recommends that urgent steps should be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland. This might include, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office or other relevant bodies to include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of the disability, severity of impairment, etc. The working group considers that it is vital that comprehensive data should be available on which to base consideration of the feasibility of a cost of disability payment. Given its advisory and research remit, the working group considers that the National Disability Authority has an important role to play in addressing these data gaps along with other relevant bodies.</P>
        <P>The working group acknowledges that a number of Departments and agencies have pre<Col N="524"/>viously carried out reviews of the various supports-payments for people with disabilities. However, these reviews have tended to focus solely on the operation of individual schemes, without taking a broader view of how these measures fit into the overall system of disability supports. The working group proposes to examine the scope for rationalising and streamlining the various disability supports measures, with a focus on mitigating the additional costs of disability for a greater number of people with disabilities, particularly in the case of those who wish to move from total welfare dependence to greater economic independence. The working group is following up these various matters.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the high cost of hospitalisation for long-stay children, she has plans to amend the terms of the domiciliary care allowance, which is discontinued when a child who normally lives at home is absent from the home for eight weeks or more; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced in 1973 by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act 1970. DCA is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention, which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.</P>
        <P>Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to the means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered unless significant additional care and attention is required. Since the allowance is intended as a recognition of the additional burden involved in caring for children with a severe disability in the their homes, it does not apply to children who are maintained full time in residential homes, schools or other institutions. Eligible children in part-time residential care who go home at weekends or holidays may receive a <i>pro rata</i> payment, that is, a nightly rate based on the number of nights spent at home &mdash; nightly rate is equal to the monthly rate multiplied by 12 and divided by 365. However, the allowance is paid in full in cases where eligible children who live full time at home are absent for periods of not more than eight weeks in a 12-month period, that is, hospital admissions or respite. There are no plans to amend the terms of the DCA in this regard.</P>

        <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is the national competent authority responsible for the licensing of the manufacture, preparation, importation, distribution and sale of all medicinal products for use in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are inspectors in each competent authority in Europe. If the manufacturing site is in Ireland, inspectors from the IMB inspect to see that the products are made to the appropriate quality and, if so, issue the manufacturing licence, which is recognised by the rest of Europe. In the case of the flu vaccine, the manufacturing site is in the UK and, therefore, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, MHRA, inspectors inspect the manufacturing site and grant, suspend etc., the manufacturing licence. The UK inspectors inform the Irish Medicines Board of their findings as necessary. Apart from the quality controls at the manufacturing site, after a batch of vaccine is released from the manufacturing site but before it reaches the Irish market, it is a condition of the licence that, &ldquo;No <Col N="527"/>batch shall be marketed in Ireland unless first released in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 89/342/EEC.&rdquo; This means a batch of vaccine cannot be imported or used in Ireland unless first released by an independent control agency. No stocks of Fluvirin vaccine manufactured at the Chiron site in Liverpool arrived in Ireland. There are no quality relating to the influenza vaccine, Agrippal, that came to Ireland from the Chiron manufacturing site in Italy.</P>

	<P>The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage, as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board-authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. The last such increase was notified in January 2004. A number of schemes provide assistance towards the cost of medication for those who do not qualify for a medical card. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of that condition free of charges. Under the drug payments scheme, a person and his-her dependants will not have to pay more than &euro;78 in a calendar month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
        <P>Health board chief executive officers have discretion regarding the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income <Col N="528"/>that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF, which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available. In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the entire legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</P>

	<P>The report of the national task force on medical staffing &mdash; Hanly report &mdash; sets out the changes needed in NCHD work patterns; a series of reforms in medical education and training, the number of additional consultants needed and how they should work under a significantly revised contract. The report emphasised that change could not be achieved without reform of acute hospital services. While additional medical training places will be required to implement the restructuring the ratio of consultants to non-consultant hospital doctors, it is not anticipated that additional training places will be required specifically to meet the requirements of the directive.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the Hanly report, the medical education and training group, MET, which formed part of the task force, remained in place to ensure NCHDs can access high quality training while the EWTD is being implemented. The group comprises representatives from the Medical Council, health employers, various statutory agencies and the IMO. The MET group published a set of training principles agreed with the Medical Council, each of the postgraduate training bodies and the Department in July 2004. The agreed principles will be used by employers and training bodies when discussing new rosters &mdash; both at national and local level. Local implemen<Col N="529"/>tation groups will be tasked with progressing the principles, which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.doh.ie</i>. Separately, the DOHC and the Irish higher surgical trainees group have agreed a series of rostering principles for higher specialist trainees in surgery. These are available on the website.</P>
        <P>The group has been asked to examine and report to me on the measures required to accommodate NCHD training in all postgraduate training programmes within a 48-hour working week; facilitate NCHDs in addressing skills deficits, which may hinder entry to the specialist register; safeguard both training and service delivery during the transition to a 48-hour working week; identify the barriers to improving graduate retention; address obstacles to the conduct of academic health research; and improve access to international training opportunities for Irish doctors in training.</P>
        <P>The group has also been asked to consider and make recommendations on issues relating to competence-based specialist training; the role of the university sector in postgraduate medical education and training; and the implications of the draft EU directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as it relates to medical practitioners. The group will engage closely with the appropriate section of the Department of Health and Children to assist it in accommodating the integrated education and training functions proposed by the task force within the structures announced by the Government in June 2003, following publication of the Brennan and Prospectus reports. It is anticipated that the group will report before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Approval in principle was recently given to the allocation of more than &euro;5 million, under various headings, to support the implementation of the European working time directive. These broad headings include projects to enhance medical education and training in association with training colleges, the Medical Council, etc; enhanced medical education and training facilities on hospital sites; support for health service agencies in implementing the EWTD; priority projects under the remit of the national co-ordinator for EWTD implementation; and educational and recruitment supports.</P>
        <P>Significant work is being undertaken in the context of industrial relations negotiations to progress issues relating to how rosters are designed and implemented in hospitals. It is my hope that all these measures will ensure doctors are fully supported in terms of training in a reduced working hours environment.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, proposes the delivery of a broad range of generalist services in the community by interdisciplinary primary care teams and primary care networks with a whole population approach. Patients will have direct access to general practitioners, nursing, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers, who will work together as a team to provide a patient-centred service in the local community. These services will be provided to the community as a whole, including older people.</P>
        <P>There is evidence that health care professionals working together as a team within the primary care setting represents the most appropriate, effective and user-friendly approach to the organisation of services. The introduction of a multidisciplinary primary care team within a community can enable people to be maintained at home in times of crisis, reduce emergency admissions and shorten lengths of hospital stay. Primary care teams will establish appropriate linkages and relationships with existing specialist community teams, which will enable the team to act as a single and ongoing point of contact in accessing required specialist services.</P>

	<P>The determination of eligibility of applications for medical card is a matter by legislation for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Assessment of eligibility is based upon the applicants&rsquo; incomes and their medical needs. Applicants have the right of appeal in cases of refusal and are normally advised of this by their local health board.</P>
        <P>Generally, the reduction in recent years in the number of medical cards may be attributed to the increase in the number of people in employment and also the improved economic situation nationally. Another factor which affects this area is the review by health boards of medical card databases. Since 2003 this has led to the removal of more than 100,000 inappropriate entries from these databases. Reasons for deletions included duplicate entries, change of address, cases where the medical card holder is deceased, ineligibility due to changed circumstances and normal reviews.</P><Col N="531"/>

	<P>An agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation in July 2001 in respect of a special allowance to be paid to general practitioners for each person on their GMS panels who hold a discretionary medical card. The notional number at that time was 20,000. A letter issued to chief executive officers of health boards in April 2002 on the definition of a discretionary card for the purpose of this special payment. It stated that the definition was to cover persons whose income exceeded the income guidelines and whose medical condition required a GP visitation rate significantly above the norm that would result in increased costs. The chief executive officers were reminded of this definition in July 2002 and asked to ensure the numbers of cards in this category met the qualifying criteria. A subgroup of health board officials, led by HeBE and in consultation with my Department, is considering the issue.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested information from the health boards on the number of discretionary cards issued in each county in recent years. All the responses have not been received. Upon receipt of this information, it may be possible to identify a change in numbers. No instruction was issued regarding who should be given a discretionary medical card, as this is the statutory responsibility of the chief executive officer of each health board-authority.</P>

	<P>Information provided to my Department indicates that frogs for use in experiments under current licences are purpose-bred abroad and are not taken from the wild. The use <Col N="532"/>of live animals in experiments in Ireland is strictly controlled in accordance with the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002. Under the Act, an experiment shall not be performed if another scientifically satisfactory method of obtaining the result sought, not entailing the use of an animal, is reasonably and practicably available. Furthermore, the person proposing to perform the experiment must carefully consider and explain the choice of species in the licence application. I have no plans to revoke licences for the use of frogs for experimental or other scientific purposes.</P>

	<P>On joining the EU, the arrangements for the co-ordination of Ireland&rsquo;s social security system, including health care benefits, with those of the other member states were agreed under the terms of EU Regulation 1408/71. As a consequence of these arrangements, persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state but not in receipt of an Irish Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs pension as a recipient or dependant and who cannot be regarded as employed or self-employed in Ireland, are entitled to receive health services free of charge and are issued with a medical card. The full costs associated with the provision of health care for such persons under the regulations are met by the country of origin.</P>
        <P>Where the EC regulations do not apply, persons with social security pensions from another EC member state are entitled to be assessed for medical cards by the chief executive officers of the health board under the normal eligibility criteria. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Apart from persons aged 70 and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and-or their dependants, such as seriously ill children, without undue hardship.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board-authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card and these are <Col N="533"/>revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person&rsquo;s income may exceed the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>A number of schemes provide assistance towards the cost of medication for those who do not qualify for a medical card. Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. The conditions are mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. A person with an eligible condition, or their parent, should contact their local health board in order to register under the scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his-her dependants will not have to pay more than &euro;78 in a calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
        <P>A range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will be ineligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>

	<P>The letter from Twins Ireland is <Col N="534"/>being examined in my Department and a reply will issue shortly. However, I wish to make the following general points. The primary childhood immunisation programme, PCIP, provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. The objective of the PCIP is to achieve an uptake level of 95%, which is the rate required to provide population immunity and to protect children and the population generally from the potentially serious diseases concerned. The PCIP provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age. Under the PCIP parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the national immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The schedule was most recently revised in October 2002.</P>
        <P>The recommended childhood immunisation schedule is as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The immunisation guidelines state that if an immunisation course is interrupted, it should be resumed as soon as possible. Children who are not immunised and are older than the recommended age should be immunised as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella and can be administered to children aged between 12 and 15 months. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from the diseases concerned and to stop the spread of the diseases in the community. Measles, in particular, is a highly infectious and serious disease. Approximately one in 15 children who contracts measles suffers serious complications.</P>
        <P>There is concern among parents regarding the MMR vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, my predecessor launched the MMR Vaccine Discussion Pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was pub<Col N="535"/>lished by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts about the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence regarding MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision.</P>
        <P>The information is presented to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The pack is set out in a question and answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn&rsquo;s disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack enables health professionals to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</P>
        <P>There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. First, the scientific evidence does not support a link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. There is no evidence that administering the three components of MMR as separate vaccines is safer. The immune system is well capable of responding to the small number of components in the MMR vaccine and there is no evidence that the component parts of the MMR vaccine interfere with each other. In any event, vaccines are designed to strengthen the immune system and not weaken it.</P>
        <P>If the vaccines were administered separately, a child would require a total of six injections to complete the course instead of two, which could also result in an increased risk of local reactions at the injection site. The practical aspect of giving six injections means children would be unprotected for a greater time from these diseases and, therefore, would be at significantly greater risk of contracting these conditions. The protracted time involved in administering the vaccines would result in the diseases in question circulating in the community for longer. Unprotected children such as younger children, that is, children below the age of 12 months and children who are immuno-suppressed would, therefore, be at greater risk of catching the diseases concerned.</P>
        <P>Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My Department&rsquo;s primary concern regarding immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. Since the original publication of UK research by Dr. Andrew Wakefield about a possible causal link between MMR vaccine and autism, many researchers have investigated the proposed causal relationship and concluded that there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. In Ireland, this issue has been examined by the immunisation <Col N="536"/>advisory committee of the RCPI and the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
        <P>The conclusions are there is no evidence to support the association between MMR vaccines and the development of autism or inflammatory bowel disease and the vaccine is safer than giving the three component vaccines separately. The Oireachtas committee has also endorsed the safety of the MMR vaccine.</P>
        <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that the MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. The institutions include the medical research council expert committee and the British committee on safety of medicines in the UK, the centres for disease control and prevention and the American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA as well as the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

	<P>The provision of home help services is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority. The aim of the home help service is to enable people to remain living at home, where appropriate, who would otherwise need to be cared for in long-stay residential care and that this service is an essential support to families and informal carers. The home help service by its nature is a flexible service, which is designed to respond to clients&rsquo; needs. The service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients in accordance with their assessed need. As a result, therefore, the service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time. Assessments are undertaken at local sector level and are carried out by public health nursing services to ensure effective prioritisation of the service.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons demand for the home help service has been increasing, such as demographic factors. Approximately 6,000 additional people come into the over 65 bracket every year and there has been a proportionately higher percentage increase in the more dependent over 80 category. These factors have necessitated minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service at health board level. Although a small percentage of clients may have <Col N="537"/>had their hours reduced, this has been counter-balanced by others receiving the service for the first time. I have been assured by all health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that the most vulnerable clients are given priority.</P><Col N="538"/>

        <P FLI="0">The total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas since 2000 is 113.59%. An additional &euro;3.748 million has been allocated by my Department to this service in 2004. The North Eastern Health Board overspent on its home help budget in 2002 to the sum of &euro;800,000 and, in accordance with accountability legislation, that amount had to be drawn down against the 2003 allocation.

For example, one hospital recently made contact with next of kin to advise them that pituitary glands of deceased relatives had been retained. A number of those contacted were greatly distressed at the news. Subsequently, another hospital decided not to make direct contact with next of kin and, instead, placed notices in the newspapers inviting next of kin of patients who died during specific periods to contact the hospital if they wished to know whether glands had been retained.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>

        <Quest>the reason there was a 14.8% reduction in the number of medical card holders in County Mayo for the period 1997 to 2004 when the average national reduction for this period was 7.75%; and the remedial action that will be taken to restore medical card coverage in County Mayo.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>From information available to the Department compiled by the GMS (Payments) Board, the percentage difference in medical card coverage in County Mayo for the period 1 January 1997 to 1 October 2004 was a decrease of 9.67% or 8,319 persons. The average national decrease for this period was 6.08% or 101,500. The determination of eligibility of applications for medical card is a matter by legislation for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Assessment of eligibility is based upon the applicant&rsquo;s income and his or her medical need. Applicants have the right of appeal in cases of refusal and are normally advised of this by their local health board.</P>
        <P>Generally, the reduction in recent years in the number of medical cards may be attributed to the increase in the number of people in employment and also the improved economic situation nationally. Another factor which affects this area is the review by health boards of medical card databases. Since 2003 this has led to the removal of more than 100,000 inappropriate entries from these databases. Reasons for deletions included duplicate entries, change of address, cases where the medical card holder is deceased, ineligibility due to changed circumstances and normal reviews. The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage, as set out in the programme for Government. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided <Col N="541"/>having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.</P>

	<P>Both the Brennan and Prospectus reports, which are central to the reform programme, refer to the likelihood of savings in the implementation of their respective recommendations. However, the Prospectus report also states it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the financial impact of programmes of this scale. The re-alignment and streamlining of functions and structures in the health system are expected to generate efficiency gains over time and any resources freed up will be re-invested in strengthening front line services. I am satisfied the new arrangements, combined with the introduction of system-wide best practice, governance and accountability systems, will ensure a stronger, more effective health system and an improved health service for patients and clients.</P>
        <P>The total funding provided for the health services in the Revised Estimates Volume 2004 was &euro;10.08 billion. This provided for &euro;9,570 million current funding, a rise of 10.7% over the Revised Estimates 2003, and &euro;510 million capital funding approximately. Since 2001 the total increase in the Health Estimate has been &euro;1.093 million, based on Revised Estimates 2002. This increase in funding has allowed the health services to address care areas outlined in the programme for Government and the health strategy such as acute hospitals, disability services and services for older people, progressing towards the highest quality of care for service users. Discussions are continuing between the Minister for Finance and myself in regard to the 2005 Estimates.</P>

	<P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention, which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year. Eligibility is <Col N="542"/>determined primarily by reference to the additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered unless significant additional care and attention required. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether a child qualifies for DCA on medical grounds.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, figures on the number of public nursing homes and beds are collated by my Department on an annual basis. The most recent long-stay activity statistics report was finalised in July 2004 and provides information on activity in long-stay units in 2003. According to the report, there were 12,339 long-stay beds in health board facilities, including respite beds, on 31 December 2003. This figure represents 51.8% of the long-stay bed complement with the remaining 49.2% of long-stay beds being provided in private and voluntary nursing homes. Currently, the inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the health boards under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. Regulations made under this Act empower health boards to inspect private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The social services inspectorate, or SSI, was established in April 1999, initially on administrative basis though it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. While in the longer term the SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards, it is concentrating initially on the child care area and, in particular, on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness, states that the SSI will be established on a statutory basis and its remit will be extended to cover residential services for people with disabilities and older people. Establishing the SSI on a statutory basis will strengthen its role and will provide it with the necessary independence in the performance of its functions. It will also serve to increase public confidence in state and voluntary social services. Consultation with the Department of Finance on the statutory instrument to enable the SSI to be established on a statutory footing is in progress.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested. The future financing of long-term care for the elderly is being examined to find the best ways to structure support for long-term care and the most effective and equitable methods of funding.</P>
        <P>The nursing home subvention scheme is also being reviewed. The purpose of this review is to develop a scheme within the system which includes standardised dependency and means testing, is less discretionary, provides a home and nursing home subvention depending on need, is consistent in implementation throughout the country and draws on experience of the operation of the old scheme. In addition, home care grant schemes have been introduced as an alternative to long term care in a number of health board areas. The Department has also encouraged the ERHA and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people. These are specifically designed to give older people the option of remaining living within their home.</P>

A circular sanctioning the implementation of the decision issued from my Department on 7 May 2003. Additional payments may be owed to some retired nurses whose acting-up allowance was not included in the calculation of premium pay. Responsibility for the payment of arrears to retired nurses rests with the health boards and the ERHA. My Department will shortly provide additional funding to the health boards and ERHA to assist them in meeting their obligations.

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of services at Naas General Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Deputy will be aware that my Department recently approved additional revenue funding of &euro;7.5 million to the authority in respect of commissioning of additional services at the hospital. This funding will facilitate the development of a range of additional services at Naas. In the accident and emergency department the following new facilities are to be commissioned: nine observation beds, two treatment rooms, two additional treatment bays, one additional resuscitation bay, a dedicated triage room for the operation of 24 hour nurse-led triage and a dedicated plaster room. The observation beds are scheduled to open in November 2004 and the remaining facili<Col N="547"/>ties, outlined above, are scheduled to open in January 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the authority that additional capacity will also be put in place in the following Departments, the target commissioning dates for which are outlined in the table below:</P>

	<P>There has been an increase of more than 50% over the period from end-1999 to end-2003 in the number of personnel employed as psychologists in the health service. This represents an increase of 150 staff from 291 to 441, in whole time equivalent terms and has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided.</P>
        <P>To continue to increase the number of psychologists employed in the health service in line with current and future demand, my Department is supporting the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services to substantially increase the number of training places in clinical psychology from 30 to 50. A new model for supporting post-graduate clinical psychology training has been agreed jointly by my Depart<Col N="548"/>ment with the health boards&rsquo; directors of human resources. The model has underpinned the establishment of new courses at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick. My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology.</P>
        <P>In addition to increased training provision, the continued availability of the fast-track working visa scheme and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications are designed to help sustain the improvements in staffing levels achieved for psychology services, both at local and national level.</P>

	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health authorities in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and three separate universities in the United Kingdom. The 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced in the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade <Col N="549"/>of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>The commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics. My <Col N="550"/>Department has also given approval in principle to a proposal to substantially improve training facilities for orthodontics at the school, which will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officers of the health authorities have informed my Department of the following information on their orthodontic treatment waiting lists as at the end of June 2004:</P><Col N="549"/>

The above table shows that at the end of the June 2004 quarter, 20,236 children were undergoing orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This represents a 42% increase on the numbers in treatment in May 1999 and means that currently there are almost twice as many children undergoing orthodontic treatment as there are children awaiting treatment.</P>

	<P>The best health for children programme provides for a new core surveillance programme for all children up to 12 years and covers both pre-school developmental examinations as well as the school health service. Underpinning the recommendations in the report is a model which embraces a more holistic child health promotion approach and emphasises the role of parents in achieving best health for children. Additional funding of over &euro;2 million was allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations set out in the report, Best Health for Children. This funding has been used to appoint key individuals at regional level to drive the implementation process at board level as well as to establish pilot projects aimed at demonstrating best practice.</P>
        <P>Working groups have been established to develop a revised national core child health surveillance and screening programme. The objec<Col N="551"/>tive is to make recommendations on the key areas of child health surveillance such as developmental, vision and oral health. One of the key recommendations in the report, Best Health for Children, is the provision of appropriate training for public health doctors and nurses involved in delivering the child health surveillance programme and the school health service. Additional funding of &euro;700,000 has been provided to health boards and the ERHA in 2003 for this purpose. The funding has been used to appoint relevant training personnel and develop in conjunction with Trinity College Dublin a training programme for those involved in the delivery of the core surveillance programme. The programme was launched earlier this year and it is intended that all those involved in child health surveillance will have received the necessary training by the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>With a view to facilitating a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the delivery of a range of child health and child care projects, the Health Boards Executive has established a programme of action for children. An interim steering group has been appointed to oversee the programme&rsquo;s work. The initiative will encompass a number of child related measures, including projects associated with best health for children.</P>

	<P>No person or group of persons other than those aged 70 years and over since 1 July 2001 is automatically entitled to a medical card. Assessments of eligibility of applicants for a medical card are, by legislation, a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards. Assessment is based on the income and medical need of the individual. The period of the validity of the card is also a matter for the health board to decide.</P>
        <P>Reviews of the databases of medical cards are carried out regularly. My Department is not aware of any plan to vary the current administrative arrangements in place in health boards.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the Kildare area is a matter for the South Western Area Health <Col N="552"/>Board acting under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. The authority has advised my Department that following recruitment of staff, an additional six beds have been opened at the Maynooth community nursing unit, giving a current total bed complement of 36 beds. The authority has further advised that the process for recruiting additional nurses is still under way, that additional beds will be opened at the unit as soon as sufficient staff are in place and that there will be a total bed complement of 44 beds when all the additional staff have been recruited.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not maintain records on vacancy levels in the health service. The quarterly health service employment returns compiled by my Department are concerned primarily with the numbers employed in the sector.</P>
        <P>The responsibility for the management of the workforce in a given region lies exclusively with the chief executive officer of relevant health board-authority. The management of the workforce includes responsibility for the recruitment of all grades of staff employed, in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the authorised ceiling. However, to improve recruitment and retention prospects my Department has put in place a number of important initiatives to meet the human resource needs of the health services. The implementation of these developments is making an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and retain the high calibre professionals required in all disciplines to fill challenging and demanding roles central to the delivery of quality health and social care services to the public.</P>
        <P>Before setting out these initiatives in detail, it is important to emphasise that staffing requirements overall must be viewed in the context of the very substantial increases in employment levels achieved in the health services in recent years. The Deputy may wish to note there has been an overall increase in the level of employment of 28,658 in wholetime equivalence, WTE, terms since 1997, excluding home helps. This represents an increase of 42% over the 1997 levels. In this regard there are, for example, 1,816, up 36%, more medical-dental personnel, 6,720, up 112%, more health and social care professionals and 6,419, up 23%, more nurses. Caution should be exercised in comparing employment growth <Col N="553"/>between grade categories owing to some changes in their composition over the period. This is a considerable achievement which reflects the success of the steps taken to increase the attractiveness of employment in the health services and also the ongoing measures being taken in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified staff.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out employment growth in the grades mentioned by the Deputy. To provide a valid statistical comparison, the employment figures for end year 2003 have been used in answering this query. Employment data for Q2 2004 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website should the Deputy require to access it. It is expected that data in respect of end year 2004 will be available in March 2005.</P>
        <P>Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all played a part in increasing staffing levels. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, also contributed significantly to meeting the workforce needs of the health services, particularly in professions where qualified staff are scarce. As mentioned earlier, specific human resource initiatives are under way in a number of key areas which have expanded considerably over recent years.</P>
        <P>With regard to the therapy professions, the report, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapists. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of that report. In the nursing area, the recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of staff has been a concern of this Government for some time and a number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 70% since 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards. The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the 1999 nurses&rsquo; pay settlement. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been especially active in this area and, to date, 1,600 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>My Department gave approval in late 2003 to the rollout, on a national basis, of the health care assistant training programme. This is in fulfilment of a key recommendation of the Commission on Nursing. The main objective of the programme is to upskill health care assistants so that, working under the supervision of nurses, they are enabled to take on a wider range of duties, thereby freeing up nursing resources to concentrate on exclusively nursing tasks.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious that, in view of the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, it is imperative that a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning be developed further and aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The issue of skill mix is also of paramount importance in meeting human resource needs. Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full potential and optimise their contribution to quality care. The Health Service Executive will have a central role to play in the development of an integrated workforce planning strategy for the health sector.</P>
        <P>I am, however, well aware that, in addition to effective planning to ensure the continued availability of a qualified, competent workforce, it is also necessary for the health service to become an employer of choice to further improve potential for recruitment and retention. While the record number of staff recruited into the health service in the past number of years shows the progress that has been made in this regard, even more can be achieved. Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff over recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In the human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The continued implementation of the Action Plan for People Management has a crucial role to play in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff, while providing the opportunity for each member of the workforce in the health sector, to maximise their contribution to the creation of a quality and patient-centred health service in line with the objectives of the health strategy.</P><Col N="553"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 172 together.</P>
        <P>A core objective of the health strategy is that all people should have access to high quality services. Priority will be given to supporting those <Col N="556"/>who need to access the health service they require and I will address the provision of health services from this perspective with particular emphasis on the implementation of the current reform programme.</P>
        <P>As regards general eligibility for health services, it is the case that under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is based on residency and means and is primarily the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
        <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service. Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to <Col N="557"/>certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;45 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;450 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;45 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
        <P>In regard to acute hospital services, the target set out in the national health strategy states that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards those patients waiting longest for treatment. In accordance with health strategy objectives, the Government&rsquo;s immediate focus is on the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times for in-patient and day case treatments in acute hospitals. This is being particularly facilitated by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has reported that waiting times have fallen significantly with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. Some 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait. The NTPF has been successful in arranging treatments for approximately 19,000 patients up to the end of September 2004. It is now the case that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.</P>
        <P>Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine departments reflect the system-wide issues. Therefore, in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments it is necessary to take a whole system approach involving primary care, acute care and sub-acute and community care. Following a submission from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, in June 2004 my Department approved proposals for short and medium term actions to be taken to address the problems associated with emergency departments in the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals, DATHS. The cost of these new initiatives is &euro;2.4 million in a full year. Areas covered include the appointment of specialist nurses, the establishment of rapid assessment teams, a clinical decisions unit and the provision of multi-disciplinary teams to assess patients.</P>
        <P>Pressures on the hospital system, particularly in the eastern region, arise from demands on emergency departments and on difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. Funding of &euro;16.8 million has been made available to the ERHA which has resulted in some 520 patients being discharged and work is ongoing to facilitate the dis<Col N="558"/>charge of a further 80 patients. Increasing acute bed capacity will also have an impact on the delivery of emergency services. As a result of the bed capacity initiative and the commissioning of new units, which was announced in September, funding is now in place for an additional 900 beds in the acute hospital system.</P>
        <P>In line with the objective set out in the health strategy to broaden the eligibility framework, the Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position. For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of that condition, free of charge. Under the drug payments scheme, a person and his or her dependants will not have to pay more than &euro;78 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
        <P>Health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services. Since the publication of Primary Care: A new Direction, significant progress has been achieved on many fronts in the development of an integrated, multi-disciplinary and team based approach to the delivery of primary care services. Initiatives included the establishment of a primary care task force, national primary care steering group, primary care implementation projects, <Col N="559"/>further research and wider implementation of the strategy.</P>
        <P>In June 2003 the Government introduced thehealth service reform programme, HSRP,based on system reviews which identified various needs, such as clear focus on service and management, less fragmentation, more accountability and better information, for modernisation in line with the health strategy. The work currently underway to implement the reform programme will combine to enhance nationwide access to health services with the overarching objective of providing higher quality delivery aimed at ensuring a healthier community.</P>

	<P>There has been a significant increase in the consultant manpower needed to deliver cardiac surgery and orthopaedic services in the last ten years. Based on figures provided by Comhairle na nOspideal the number of cardiothoracic surgeons has increased from six to 11 between 1993 and 2003 and the number of orthopaedic surgeons has increased from 52 to 76 in the same period.</P>
        <P>Plans and developments are in place which will increase the capacity for cardiac surgery. For example, the theatre and critical care complex, completed as part of the Phase 2 development at University College Hospital Galway, includes provision for cardiac surgery facilities. Approval has also been given to the Southern Health Board to proceed with the planning and construction of a new &euro;82 million cardiac and renal dialysis building at Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>In relation to orthopaedic services the North Eastern Health Board has re-organised its orthopaedic services in moving trauma services to Drogheda and creating additional capacity for elective services in Navan. A new orthopaedic service was opened at Mayo General Hospital in September 2004. This new service serves the people of the western region and increases orthopaedic capacity for the region.</P>
        <P>The single most limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability therefore increasing the bed capacity of the acute hospital system is of particular priority for my Department. As a result of the bed capacity initiative and the commissioning of new units, which was announced in September, funding is now in place for an additional 900 beds in the acute hospital system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 167, 171 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the collection and reporting of waiting lists and waiting times now falls within the remit of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the NTPF to respond directly to the Deputy on the number of patients awaiting treatment for ophthalmology procedures. The NTPF has the capacity to treat more than 1,000 patients per month or 12,000 in a full year from the funding available to it. Since it commenced operations the fund has been successful in locating additional capacity, both here <Col N="561"/>and in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and arranging treatments for over 19,000 patients up to the end of September 2004. The majority of these patients have been treated in hospitals in Ireland. It is now the case that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s policy on care of older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence in their own home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. This policy was first enunciated in the Care of the Aged Report which was published in 1968 and <Col N="562"/>confirmed in the report, The Years Ahead, A Policy for the Elderly, published in 1988. Numerous research studies have shown that the vast majority of older people have a preference to remain living in their own home for as long as possible rather than moving into long-stay residential care. Indeed, the preferred option for most families is to help care for their elderly relatives at home for as long as possible with the assistance of local health service staff.</P>
        <P>My Department has been encouraging the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long-stay residential care. Additional funding of &euro;1.25 million was made available to the authority-health boards this year for the introduction of personal care packages. This is on top of the significant expenditure currently being incurred on home help and other services aimed at supporting people at home.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for issues relating to carers is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan. Officials of my Department engage on a regular basis with their counterparts in the Department of Social and Family affairs on matters in which they have a mutual interest including the position of carers and those in receipt of care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 179 together.</P><Col N="563"/>
        <P>Reports of the national cancer registry have examined variations in incidence of cancer among counties and health board areas during the period from 1994 onwards. Variations in case numbers, overall or for particular cancers, obviously reflect variation in population size or in population age-structure. Age standardised rates show less variation, but nevertheless some variation is evident, although, for most counties or regions, rates do not show statistically significant variation from the national average. The main exception is Dublin and the ERHA region where incidence rates are higher than the national average for cancers as a whole, and for a number of individual cancers, including lung, breast and prostate cancers. For lung and a number of other cancers, variation is strongly influenced by smoking, which tends to be most prevalent in urban, particularly deprived urban areas. For breast and prostate cancer, incidence rates may be increased in areas where there are higher levels of screening, for example, breast screening.</P>
        <P>In general, cancers not strongly influenced by smoking, socio-economic or screening-related factors show less marked variation within Ireland and any such variation cannot readily be attributed to specific factors without further research into specific cancers. Distinguishing true geographic variation from random or chance variation is also a problem given the small numbers of cases involved at county level for most cancers.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, significant developments in cancer services have taken place in all regions. The overall additional cumulative funding in cancer services in this country since 1997 is in excess of &euro;550 million including an additional &euro;15 million revenue which has been allocated this year. An additional 104 consultant posts in key areas of cancer treatment and 245 clinical nurse specialists across all health board areas have been funded. There has also been approximately &euro;95 million in capital funding allocated specifically for the development of cancer related initiatives. These include an investment of &euro;60 million in radiation oncology and &euro;11.9 million in BreastCheck.</P>
        <P>The investment and appointments in cancer services have resulted in substantial increases in activity levels across the three modalities of care of radiation oncology, medical oncology and surgical oncology. There has been a 36% increase nationally in surgical procedures for breast cancer, with an additional 500 procedures performed in 2002 compared to 1997. Substantial progress is being made in developing radiation oncology. In 2004, an additional &euro;3.5 million is being used to develop the radiation oncology services at the supra regional centres at University College Hospital Galway and Cork University Hospital. The immediate developments in the south and west will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity.</P><Col N="564"/>
        <P>The appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists is under way. We have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term. Additional funding of &euro;15 million and 130 staff for these centres have been approved recently to develop radiation oncology services regionally.</P>
        <P>The national roll-out of the BreastCheck programme to remaining counties is a major priority in the development of cancer services. This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group throughout the country have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where required. A capital investment of &euro;20 million has been approved to construct and equip two static clinical units, one at South Infirmary Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. This investment will also ensure that mobile units are available to screen women in the relevant age group throughout the country.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, there is a commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 5,600 extended care-community nursing unit places over a seven year period which will include provision for people with dementia. Provision of the above facilities was contingent on the provision of the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>In relation to subvented beds, the Deputy may wish to note that, in 1994, the first full year of implementation of the nursing home subvention scheme, 3,200 people received subvention. At the end of April 2004 over 9,900 people were in receipt of subvention.</P>
        <P>In addition, public private partnerships, PPPs, are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units, CNUs, for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are <Col N="565"/>complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment-rehabilitation; respite; extended care; convalescence and, if the PPP pilot demonstrates success, it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 178 together.</P>
        <P>Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine departments reflect system-wide issues. Therefore, in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments, it is necessary to take a whole system approach involving primary care, acute care and sub-acute and community care.</P>
        <P>Already the Government, over the last few years, has introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving the delivery of acute services and alleviating the pressures on accident and emergency departments. I have previously said that the delivery of such services will be an area for particular attention during my term as Minister for Health and Children. I intend to identify the particular pressure points within the health system that affect the efficient delivery of emergency services. I will be working with the relevant authorities to ensure that the most pressing problems are addressed as a matter of urgency and, as such, I intend to introduce a package of measures to address these problems.</P>

	<P>The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, aims to shift the emphasis from the current over-reliance on acute hospital services to one where patients will be able to access an integrated multi-disciplinary team of general practitioners, nurses, health care <Col N="567"/>assistants, home helps, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and social workers in their local community.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the team based model of service delivery has the potential to meet 90-95% of all health and personal social service needs in the primary care setting. As the primary care teams are developed, a wider primary care network of other professionals, including speech and language therapists, community pharmacists, dieticians, dentists, chiropodists and psychologists will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team.</P>
        <P>Primary care planned and organised on this basis, can lessen the current reliance on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services. Based on available evidence, it has the potential to reduce the requirement for specialist services, reduce hospitalisation rates, reduce lengths of stay for those who are hospitalised and improve efficiency.</P>
        <P>The strategy also envisages the development of extended-hours and out-of-hours cover for defined primary care services. The management of this wide range of care within the primary care setting represents the most appropriate, effective and user-friendly approach to the organisation of service delivery. Clearly, a significant element in the development of future primary care teams must involve the reorientation of the substantial staff and physical resources currently within the primary care setting. The health boards are currently working to map the general configuration of future teams and networks and to develop team working and collaborative working in the existing primary care services. The mapping exercise involves an examination of service needs, demographic and other relevant data to ensure that primary care services are organised and developed on the basis of identified need.</P>
        <P>The strategy recognises that the provision of modern, well-equipped, accessible premises will be central to the effective functioning of the primary care team. It emphasises the need to gain full benefit from existing buildings and to fully exploit any opportunities for public-private partnerships in implementing the development programme. I intend to develop policy in such a way as to encourage innovative approaches that have the potential to result in the provision where appropriate, of modern, well-equipped, user-friendly buildings to support the development and operation of primary care teams and networks.</P>

	<P>In respect of people availing of public long-stay care, charges can be made under two regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person&rsquo;s income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges. Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants. Under the Health Act 1970 the determination of eligibility for health services, including charges, is primarily the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. I understand from the health boards that the person&rsquo;s home is not considered during such assessment. Under the Second Schedule of the Nursing Home Regulations 1993 (S.I. No. 227 of 1993), provision was made for including the value of the person&rsquo;s home in respect of the subvention of private nursing homes only.</P>
        <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person&rsquo;s personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

	<P>The provision of health centres to meet the needs of local communities and the maintenance and upgrading of such centres within its functional area is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of Youghal, County Cork, this responsibility rests with the Southern Health Board.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Health boards are not statutorily obliged to provide chiropody services. It is not one of the attendant benefits of being a medical card holder. Decisions to make chiropody and other services available are a matter for the local health board to make, bearing in mind their priorities and the funding available to them.</P>
        <P>Where chiropody services are provided, they are normally given to persons aged 65 years and over and those suffering from particular medical conditions. There are a variety of arrangements in place nationally for the provision of chiropody service to clients, with a mixture of public and private practitioners in different locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Persons were not obliged to pay the supplementary charge for chiropody services. In cases where payments were made, it was a matter between the chiropodist and the client, and therefore outside of the medical card scheme. As a consequence, there is no record of the numbers involved or the amounts paid.</P>
        <P>When it became known that chiropodists in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region were imposing an additional charge the Department wrote to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and stated that these were inappropriate and should not be levied on people who were deemed eligible for the service under the Eastern Regional Health Authority scheme.</P>

	<P>The drugs payment scheme, with a monthly threshold of £42, &euro;53.33, replaced the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme on 1 July 1999. Under this scheme, families and individuals only had to meet the first &euro;53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The drug cost subsidisation scheme threshold was £32, &euro;40.63, per month per individual, and for the drug refund scheme it was £90,&euro;114.28, per quarter for each eligible person and dependants. Under the drug refund scheme, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter.</P>
        <P>The drug refund scheme threshold was raised from &euro;53.33 to &euro;65 on 1 August 2002, from &euro;65 to &euro;70 from 1 January 2003 and from &euro;70 to &euro;78 from 1 January 2004.</P>

	<P>The development of performance indicators in relation to the services funded by my Department is a continuing process which has been carried out jointly with the health boards. It would not be possible to effectively measure the performance to the entire health and personnel social services concerned by way of just five performance indicators. My Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has been developing a range of performance indicators in association with service plan developments. A suite of 84 indicators have been specified to cover all services funded by my Department. Because these indicators are still developmental in nature, in many cases, and have only been in use, in the main, during the past three to four years it would not be possible to present a picture of the movement of these indicators since 1997.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to an appeal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal for a primary medical certificate for eligibility for tax relief under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. In this respect, I wish to advise that my Department has no direct involvement in the operation of the disabled drivers medical board of appeal. However, I am informed that there is currently a backlog of appeals to be dealt with by the board.</P>
        <P>At present, there is a waiting time of over two years for appellants to be seen by the board. I am advised that the backlog of appeals, approximately 600, is caused by a number of factors, in particular the general increase in applications for a primary medical certificate and the significant number of persons who are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but nevertheless insist on exercising their right of appeal.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental review group was established to examine the operation of the scheme and the group&rsquo;s report was made public in early July 2004. Following on from the report&rsquo;s recommendations concerning the appeals process, amendments to the regulations governing the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme were drafted to improve the operation of the medical appeals board. These were signed by the Minister for Finance on 23 July 2004.</P>
        <P>The amendments provide for changes to the existing regulations as follows: expanding the panel of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal from three to five and amending the appeals process by introducing a six month waiting period between an appeal and a subsequent application, and introducing the requirement for a second or subsequent application to be certified by a registered medical practitioner to the effect that there has been material disimprovement in the medical condition since the previous application.</P>
        <P>In regard to the first change, on the recommendation of the Minister for Health and Children, I hope shortly to appoint two more doctors to the board. A panel of five doctors should allow for the board to meet more regularly and hence reduce the backlog. As regards the second change, it should be noted that a further factor in the backlog of appeals is that a number of those who are seen by the board and are dissatisfied with its decision are re-appealing immediately and this is causing a build up of appeals. The change addresses this issue and should free up the appeals board to deal with existing appeals in the system and subsequent appeals where a change in an individual&rsquo;s circumstance requires a reassessment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the promotion of and admissions to live theatrical or musical performances, including circuses, are exempt from VAT under paragraph <i>viii</i> of the First Schedule to the VAT Act 1972, as amended. However, this exemption does not include dances or performances in conjunction with which facilities are available for the consumption of food or drink during all or part of the performance by persons attending the performance.</P>
        <P>On the issue of zero rating tickets for the performing arts, the position is that, under the EU sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, member states may only retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991 but are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. It is therefore not possible to apply a zero VAT rate to tickets for the performing arts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>I have no intention of intervening with regard to endowment loan shortfalls at present. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is already studying the situation, having commenced a survey earlier this year, to determine whether and to what extent there will be difficulties for customers. It would be premature at this stage to second guess the outcome of the survey. I will continue to review the adequacy of the relevant legislative framework as the information developed by IFSRA becomes available.</P>
        <P>There is already a substantial volume of legislation in place relating to these products. The Consumer Credit Act 1995, which commenced in May 1996, contains specific provisions in relation to endowment loans and in particular prescribes certain information which must be included in any application form or information document issued to consumers applying for such loans. For example, since the commencement of the Act all endowment loan application forms must contain a prominent notice to the effect that &ldquo;There is no guarantee that the proceeds of the insurance policy will be sufficient to repay the loan in full when it becomes due for payment&rdquo;.</P><Col N="578"/>
        <P>The Act also obliges that in instances where there is a possibility during the lifetime of an endowment loan that borrowers may be required to increase premium payments on the insurance policy relating to the loan, any document approving the loan must contain a prominent statement of this possibility. Similarly information documents on endowment loans must, where the possibility exists that early surrender of the insurance policy may result in a net loss to the consumer, taking into account premia and other charges paid in, contain a statement of this possibility.</P>
        <P>The Act also places an obligation upon insurers underwriting policies relating to endowment loans to issue a statement to the consumer every five years setting out not only the value of the policy at the time of issue but also a comparison of this valuation to the valuation at such date projected at the time the policy was first written and a revised estimate of the valuation at maturity.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations, which came into being in 2001, oblige insurers to provide policy holders, including holders of policies relating to endowment mortgages, with an annual written statement containing, <i>inter alia</i>, information on the current surrender or maturity value of the policy.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Government has already very considerably enhanced the regulatory and supervisory regime governing the financial services industry, primarily through the enactment of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, which established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, complements the Act passed last year and further enhances IFSRA&rsquo;s powers and strengthens the regulatory environment. Particular features of the 2004 Act are that it provides for an enhanced structure for dealing with consumers who have complaints about financial institutions and also provides consumer and industry consultative panels for the financial regulator. The consumer panel will have an important role in ensuring that the regulator is correctly reflecting the interests of consumers in its protective &mdash; issue of codes of conduct &mdash; and educational &mdash; information pamphlets &mdash; roles. These provisions will help IFSRA to ensure consumers have all necessary information to allow them to make considered and informed choices between differing financial products including mortgages.</P>

	<P>The most recent price comparisons that have been carried out by the Revenue Commissioners relate to June <Col N="584"/>2004. These provide a snapshot of the average retail prices of the main excisable commodities observed in the Dublin and Newry areas on 29 June 2004. The following tables provide a breakdown of the prices and tax on these commodities on that date. With respect to vehicles that are subject to vehicle registration tax, VRT, in the State, comparisons cannot be made with Northern Ireland as VRT is not imposed in that jurisdiction.</P><Col N="583"/>

	<P>A pre-budget submission from the Blind Car Owners and Users Association was received by my office in early October. This organisation also made submissions to the interdepartmental review group established to review the disabled drivers&rsquo; and disabled passengers&rsquo; tax concessions scheme. The group&rsquo;s report examined all aspects of the scheme including the qualifying medical criteria. The Government has agreed that the Minister for Finance will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme This submission, as with all other pre-budget submissions, will be considered in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 14 October which dealt with the matters raised. The position is as follows: The report of the interdepartmental review group, established to examine the operation of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme, was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in early July 2004. It sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme, the current benefits, the Exchequer costs, the various requests to broaden the eligi<Col N="587"/>bility criteria and various recommendations for changes to the scheme.</P>
        <P>Following on from the report&rsquo;s recommendations concerning the appeals process, amendments to the regulations governing the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme were drafted to improve the operation of the medical appeals board. These were signed by the Minister for Finance on 23 July 2004.</P>
        <P>The amendments provide for changes to the existing regulations as follows: expanding the panel of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal from three to five and amending the appeals process by introducing a six month waiting period between an appeal and a subsequent application, and introducing the requirement for a second or subsequent application to be certified by a registered medical practitioner to the effect that there has been material disimprovement in the medical condition since the previous application.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed that the Minister for Finance will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>

	<P>Ireland is not yet a member of the Council of Europe Development Bank, CEB. Although the bank was founded in 1956, Ireland did not join at that stage. However, negotiations for membership have taken place and the Council of Europe Development Bank Bill 2004, currently at Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will allow Ireland to join the bank. The terms and conditions of our membership and participation in the operations of the <Col N="588"/>bank were set out in the Second Stage speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, taken on my behalf, on 21 October 2004. Up to now, the Irish Government has not had a financial relationship with the Council of Europe Development Bank, but the CEB may well have had a relationship with Irish based financial institutions.</P>

The data from the central applications facility, CAF, operated by the Civil Service Commission, published last month showed that a total of 85 persons have applied for decentralising to Kanturk as their first choice. The Southern Health Board is not a participating organisation in the CAF and therefore its staff cannot apply.</P>

        <Quest>the five measurable performance indicators which he regards as target of greatest priority within his Department; the way in which this measure has changed in each year since 1997; his views on whether confining priorities to five indicators gives too partial a picture of departmental priorities; and if he will indicate the movement over the period 1997 to 2004 of other primary indicators of performance.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The performance indicators used by the Department since 1997 are set out in the statements of strategy for the Department published since that date. Given the diversity of the Department&rsquo;s objectives and their impact on all aspects of the economy and the community in general, it would be inappropriate to attempt to draw any meaningful conclusions about the Department and its work based on just five performance indicators. For example, our statement of strategy for the period 2003-2005, which was published in April 2003, sets out approximately 80 high-level objectives and 50 indicators of progress. These were addressed in the context of the Department&rsquo;s seven strategic priorities, as follows: To support sustainable growth and employment creation, social progress and improved living standards through the formulation of appropriate economic and budgetary policies; to maximise delivery of the Government&rsquo;s economic and social objectives through the development and management of effective taxation and public expenditure policies; to develop policies that continue to promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests at EU and international level and which support the social and economic progress of the EU; to promote the effective regulation of the financial services sector; to promote and implement policies in relation to incomes, with particular reference to the public service, which take account of the financial position of the Exchequer and support competitiveness and the delivery of better public services; to support and improve public service management; and to provide an efficient, high quality service to our customers in line with the standards and targets set out in our customer service action plan.</P>
        <P>Given the number and complexity of our objectives and their associated indicators of progress, along with annual changes in our business environment since 1997, it would be inadvisable for the Department to confine its strategic analysis of the economy as a whole over the period in question to a limited subset of objectives and their relevant indicators.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>At this time of the year I receive a large number of pre-budget submissions requesting funding for a wide range of issues. Each one will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>As I have previously indicated, there is already a significant level of investment by Government in disability specific services through a number of Departments. At present, some &euro;2.5 billion, representing 7% of gross current public expenditure on services, is provided specifically for people with disabilities. This includes health sector services specifically for persons with an intellectual disability or autism, physical or sensory disabilities and mental illness; first and second level special needs education funded through the Department of Education and Science; the specialised training and employment support services provided by F&Aacute;S; the cost of various tax relief schemes; and local authority spending to adapt accommodation specifically for people with disabilities. These figures do not take account of the income support and other services provided through the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the fact that many people with a disability participate in, or benefit from, mainstream public service programmes and services. For example, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and other similar key services for people with a disability are provided as part of the mainstream health services. Similarly, improving access to public transport services for persons with mobility and sensory impairments is an integral requirement of all Exchequer funded new investment in buses, rolling stock and station infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Disability Bill was recently published and was accompanied by an announcement of new funding arrangements for capital and current spending on disability support services. On the capital front, a multi-annual capital investment programme for disability-specific services will be developed within the overall system of five-year multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004. This was a major change in the treatment of capital spending. It provided for a rolling investment programme and a structured and planned approach to capital spending. These envelopes will be reviewed and rolled forward in the current Estimates and budget process. Decisions in relation to the investment programme for disability-specific services will be announced as part of that process.</P>
        <P>On the current side, the Government has decided on a fundamentally different approach to current funding for high priority disability support services. In contrast to the traditional year-to-year basis, a multi-annual funding package for <Col N="591"/>current expenditure on these services will be agreed within the Estimates and budget process. This is the first time that Government has adopted this approach in the case of spending on services. This new approach shows the Government&rsquo;s commitment to funding for disability support services and overall to implementing the initiatives announced with the publication of the Disability Bill.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, under the regulation of ComReg, the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>In its report on Ireland&rsquo;s Broadband Future, published in December 2003, the Information <Col N="592"/>Society Commission concluded that the market has failed to respond to the demand for broadband connectivity, and there is a proven need for Government intervention to accelerate the provision of infrastructure and the driving of demand.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s broadband action plan, which was launched in December last, will see broadband connectivity rolled out to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and over, using community broadband exchanges and strategic fibre. A spend of &euro;35 million each year from now until 2007 has been committed to the broadband action plan. Five towns in Kildare, Kilcullen, Kildare, Maynooth, Newbridge and Rathangan, have submitted proposals under the current call for proposals and are being evaluated.</P>
        <P>In addition to this initiative, the group broadband scheme, which was launched in March last, will allow smaller communities to pool their requirements and obtain broadband connectivity from a range of service providers, with &euro;25 million in funding assistance from Government. Full details of the broadband rollout programme are on my Department&rsquo;s websites,<i> www.dcmnr.ie</i> and <i>www.gbs.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 the functions of sea-fishing boat licensing and registration were transferred from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act. All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are considered by the Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats. The head of the licensing authority is the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior official in my Department. The licensing authority has informed me that the vessel concerned has been approved for entry onto the fishing boat register and that a certificate of registry for the vessel has now issued to the owner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>An independent Licensing <Col N="593"/>Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats, which is responsible for both the licensing and registration of fishing boats, was established last year under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003. The processing of licensing applications had to be suspended for much of last year pending the finalisation of a new EU fleet policy and the consequent introduction of a new national licensing policy. The licensing authority has since been working through a backlog of licensing applications. It has informed me that it expects, by the end of next month, to have processed all licence applications currently on hands and to be in a position whereby a substantive reply will issue to all future applicants within four weeks of the date of receipt.</P>
        <P>The licensing authority has informed me that it has processed all licence applications received in 2003 to the greatest extent possible. In many cases licence offers have been issued but all of the conditions of offer have to be complied with by the vessel owner before a licence can issue. With regard to licence applications made in 2004, the licensing authority has processed the vast majority of applications to the greatest extent possible other than those relating to the specific and aquaculture fleet segments. The licensing authority found it necessary to review the position with regard to the licensing of certain vessels in these fleet segments but hopes to shortly be able to issue a substantive reply in all of these cases.</P>
        <P>The processing to finality of registration applications has been delayed in certain cases, mainly due to the need for the licensing authority to resolve, with the European Commission, a technical issue arising from new EU requirements in relation to the reporting of fleet changes. This issue has resulted in a delay in entering some vessels on the fishing boat register. The licensing authority is hopeful that the technical issue can be resolved very shortly so that the processing of any currently outstanding registration applications can be completed. The licensing authority hopes to shortly be in a position to have all registration applications processed within three weeks of their receipt.</P>

	<P>My Department has six high level goals, which are set out in our current strategy statement. They are to work to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the sustained operation of all its institutions, promoting co-operation, mutual understanding and respect between both traditions on the island, between North and South in Ireland and between these islands. The second goal is to pursue Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy in accordance with the ideals enshrined in the Constitution and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter, through the development of our bilateral relations with other states and our active and principled participation in international organisations. The third goal is to promote and protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests at the heart of the European Union as it enlarges and develops, including at the convention and subsequent IGC on the Future of Europe, while ensuring an efficient and effective EU Presidency in 2004 during which the historic enlargement of the European Union is due to take place.</P>
        <P>The fourth goal is to promote Ireland&rsquo;s trade, investment and other interests, including its culture, in close co-operation with other Departments, State agencies and the private sector, ensuring that the State&rsquo;s network of diplomatic and consular missions adds real value to this task. The fifth goal is to make a substantial and effective contribution to lasting poverty reduction and sustainable growth in developing countries through the policy and programmes of Ireland Aid, and by working for a just and stable international economic system. The sixth goal is to protect the interests of Irish citizens abroad, maintain and strengthen links with people of Irish ancestry, and provide a modern and efficient passport and consular service.</P>
        <P>These goals reflect the priorities with regard to the main policy work areas of the Department at the time the last strategy statement was prepared. The policy areas to which these goals refer have remained my Department&rsquo;s main priorities throughout the period from 1997 to date.</P>
        <P>In the intervening period, certain goals have been achieved, such as conclusion of negotiations on the EU constitution and the conduct of an effective EU Presidency in which enlargement of the EU was successfully concluded.</P>
        <P>Other primary indications of performance in the period 1997-2004 can be judged in the suc<Col N="596"/>cessful election to and term of office for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council. There are also specific and measurable indicators to show progress in the achievement of all of the goals during the period from 1997. These include developments in North-South relations, expansion of the Department&rsquo;s support for Irish economic efforts aboard and the response to the very significant increase in demands on our consular passport and visa service at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the goals as listed give an adequate picture of the Departmental priorities. My Department is about to commence work on a new strategy statement in the course of which we will be reviewing the priorities for the period ahead.</P>

        <P>Following this report, the Irish Embassy in London made contact with the Foreign Office, and subsequently the Home Office, conveyed the initial details, and requested an explanation.

I will respond directly to the Deputy when in receipt of a reply from the British authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department does occasionally receive complaints with regard to how security checks are handled by the British authorities.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be recalled at the outset that states are obliged, under international law, to protect the rights of all civilians in their territory, including aid workers, even in time of war or armed conflict. Ireland has consistently called upon all states to respect these obligations.</P>
        <P>With regard to a convention to provide protected status for aid workers, the Deputy may be aware of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel of 1994, to which Ireland acceded in March 2002. The convention applies in respect of UN personnel on defined UN operations, and associated personnel, that is, personnel provided, with the agreement of the UN, by governments, intergovernmental organisations, or humanitarian non-governmental organisations, to assist in the fulfilment of the mandate of such UN operations. The convention obliges states parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of UN and associated personnel and to protect them from murder, kidnapping or other attack. It also requires states parties to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, and to co-operate with one another in any such criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P>A number of weaknesses have been identified in the legal regime created by the convention, in particular the narrow definition accorded to the term &ldquo;UN operation&rdquo;, which prevents the application of the convention to non-peace keeping operations without a prior declaration of exceptional risk by the General Assembly or Security Council. In response to this, the strengthening of the scope of the convention has been discussed by the Sixth (International Law) Committee of the UN General Assembly.</P>
        <P>In meetings of the sixth committee, Ireland and its EU partners have been consistent and strong supporters of the strengthening of the convention. In the meeting of the sixth committee on this matter, held earlier this month, Ireland and the EU called for the application of the convention to be extended to all UN operations delivering humanitarian, political or development assistance. Discussions on this matter are expected to be resumed in spring 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.</P>
        <P>South Dublin County Council has applied for grant aid under the local authority swimming pool programme for a proposed new swimming pool in Jobstown in west Tallaght and the replacement of the existing swimming pool in Clondalkin. In June 2004, I approved the contract documents for the pool project in Jobstown and this approval allows the county council to invite tenders for the work proposed. Once the tender documentation has been submitted to my Department, the project can be considered further. The position in regard to the Clondalkin pool is that the contract documents for the project are under consideration in my Department.</P>
        <P>Grant aid is not allocated until the tenders have been approved for a project. The maximum grant available under the programme is &euro;3.8 million, which is available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. The local authority must provide the balance of the financing directly or in a combination of local authority funding, community group financing, private sector etc.</P>
        <P>Projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly in regard to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Depart<Col N="599"/>ment&rsquo;s annual Estimates provision for the programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has been working closely with the National Library and the National Museum to achieve implementation with effect from 1 January next of the key sections of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997. This will mean that the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland will become non-commercial semi-State bodies from this date, with statutory boards. It is my intention in the context of the 2005 Estimates process to seek a level of funding for both institutions which would permit them to discharge fully their current functions together with the additional administrative responsibilities, that they will be required to discharge as a result of autonomy.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the Act will affect the existing staff members in two ways. First, under section 30(4) of the Act, those members of staff who are engaged for the performance of duties exclusively in the museum or library, as the case <Col N="600"/>may be, shall, with effect from establishment day be transferred to, and become members of the staff of, the board of the museum or the board of the library. They will in effect become public servants from 1 January next.</P>
        <P>Second, under section 31(1) of the Act, those staff serving in a general service capacity will be given an option to continue to work with their respective institution after establishment day, on a secondment basis, for a specified period of time within which they will be required to decide whether to transfer to the new boards or return to the general service. Details of this secondment arrangement are still being finalised.</P>
        <P>In all cases where staff are transferred to the new boards, the Act provides that they shall not while in the service of the boards receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less beneficial terms and conditions of service than those to which they were subject immediately before the establishment day.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for safety of the collections, which are and will remain the property of the State, in both institutions will be no less than at present. Maintenance of the buildings will remain a function of the Office of Public Works. A financial provision will be made in the form of grant-in-aid to both new institutions to enable them take out their own insurance to cover public and employers&rsquo; liability.</P>

	<P>The difference between upper and lower tier establishments, in terms of Directive 96/82/EC, is based on the levels of dangerous substances held at that establishment.

        <P>All establishments, subject to the directive, are subject to general requirements including that they must be notified to the Health and Safety Authority. A major accident prevention policy document, MAPP, must also be prepared and held by the establishment. All are subject to the land use planning provisions of the directive.</P>
        <P>Upper tier establishments, in addition to the general requirements, must produce and submit to the authority a detailed safety report and must notify the public within a specified area of safety measures to be taken in the event of an emergency.

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio, including decisions regarding location and size of land owned by the authority, are day-to-day operational matters for the authority and not matters in which I have a function.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has informed me that it purchased approximately 48 hectares, 120 acres, in five lots from separate owners at Belcamp, County Dublin, in 1997. As is standard practice, a site acquisition report was prepared by consultants engaged by the agency, which involved opening sample trial pits on the land. This report did not indicate any impediments with the purchase of the site and subsequently the purchase was executed.</P>
        <P>In June 2001, illegal waste was discovered on approximately two acres of this land when Dublin City Council contractors were conducting excavation works for the laying of the major north fringe sewer. The nature of the illegal waste discovered is bio-hazardous clinical/general waste and, from analysis, was deposited in the 1980s prior to IDA Ireland acquiring the land. IDA Ireland has begun legal proceeding against the vendors in regard to this matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.</P>
        <P>Since the discovery, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s primary concern has been, and continues to be, health and safety. The agency took immediate action by fencing off the area, erecting signage and capping the area with clean soil pending the implementation of a solution.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has assured me that it is managing the situation according to best international practice. It appointed experts to advise on the extent of the problem and its implications with particular emphasis on health, safety and environmental issues. Specialist environmental consultants were retained to provide expert advice on solutions and extensive consultations with the appropriate regulatory and local authorities were held.</P>
        <P>The containment solution was proposed to IDA following consultations with the experts as the best means of solving the problem and addressing concerns regarding the welfare of the surrounding community and environment. This containment solution is the subject of a recent planning application by IDA Ireland to the plan<Col N="605"/>ning authorities, Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council, as the land straddled both council areas.</P>

	<P>The CSO consumer price index statistics show that there was a reduction of 19.3% in motorcar insurance between the months of April 2003 and September 2004. The CSO index is based on averages but many individual policyholders have done much better as is evidenced from data provided by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB. Examples provided by MIAB for three specific companies between March 2003 and March 2004 indicate the following reductions: 10% to 16% in comprehensive insurance for a 30 year old male, 10% to 41% in comprehensive insurance for a 50 year old female, and 10% to 45% for third party, fire and theft insurance for a 21 year old male.</P>
        <P>Motor insurance market losses from 1997 to 2001 were reversed in 2002 and 2003 and profit levels in 2003 have been very significant. However, the cumulative profit margin in motor insurance between 1997 and 2003 was only<?oasys _jy?>4.8%. I strongly welcome the premium reductions we have seen to date and I expect that further premium reductions will follow from the new market conditions now in place.</P>
        <P>EU law prevents Governments from intervening directly in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Governments are free to take steps to improve the functioning of the market, and the Government&rsquo;s concern for motorists and businesses regarding insurance premia has been pursued in the insurance reform programme. A significant number of the MIAB recommendations, which were central to the reform programme, have been fully implemented, and the majority of the remaining recommendations are being progressed.</P>
        <P>Reforms such as the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, action in the areas of road safety and driver behaviour and the Civil Liability and Courts Act tackling fraudulent and exaggerated personal injury claims will further benefit consumers and genuine claimants and drive premium reductions.</P>
        <P>Competition from new entrants attracted by the improvement in market conditions will be an important element in ensuring continuing downward pressure on premia. New entrants in the motor and liability areas authorised to operate on a freedom-of-services basis in Ireland include Brit <Col N="606"/>Insurance and ARB Underwriting. Great American Insurance International was authorised by IFSRA in June 2004. Santam Europe Limited, with a parent company based in South Africa, was authorised by IFSRA in August 2004. Quanta Europe Limited, a subsidiary of Quanta Capital Holdings, Ltd., Bermuda, was authorised by IFSRA on 1 September 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Competition Authority have undertaken a joint study to identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. A preliminary report and consultation document on competition issues in the non-life insurance market was published on 18 February 2004. Following a consultation period, a final report will be published, which will contain recommendations based on its findings. I expect these reforms will result in further premium reductions going forward.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that following the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, my Department no longer regulates the insurance industry. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, retains overall responsibility for policy and legislation in relation to the provision of financial services in Ireland, including insurance.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Transport, in the light of broader responsibility for legislation regarding motor insurance, including negotiation and transposition of EU motor insurance directives, the operation of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, the requirement for motor insurance and road safety, will shortly take over the lead role in relation to policy and legislation on the availability and cost of motor insurance, including related interdepartmental co-ordination.</P>

	<P>My Department has a broad range of responsibilities and activities. These are grouped together in the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2003-2005 under five pillars covering the following areas: enterprise, innovation and growth; quality work and learning; making markets and regulation work better; quality, value and continuous improvement; and the European Union. High level performance indicators are set for each of these five pillars.</P>
        <P>An example of a high-level goal under pillar one is the prioritisation of investment in science, technology and innovation and the development of the knowledge society. High-level performance indicators for this goal include business expenditure on research and development, and gross expenditure on research and development. A high-level goal under pillar two involves ensuring that labour market policy responds to changing skills needs and prioritising investment that delivers better jobs, life-long learning for all and enhanced social inclusion. High-level performance indicators for this goal include: complete reviews of supports to the long-term unemployed and of the national employment service; and an action plan to implement policy for lifelong learning to be completed by the end of 2003 in agreement with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Under the Public Service Management Act, each Department is required to prepare an annual progress report on the implementation of the strategy statements. The Department&rsquo;s most recent annual report, published in May 2004, sets out progress against the achievement of goals set out in the Statement of Strategy 2003-2005.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing the way in which Departmental performance indicators are set and reported on in the context of the Public Service Management Act requirement to prepare a new strategy statement within six months of the appointment of a new Minister and also to progress the roll-out of the management information framework. That process will establish a set of key performance indicators against which progress will be reported in subsequent annual reports. I envisage that, in line with practice in the current strategy statement, the diversity of my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities will require significantly more than five performance indicators.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243, 249 and 258 together.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are paid under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
        <P>There are no circumstances in which women in domestic violence situations have to remain in such situations due to changes introduced into the rent supplement scheme earlier this year. Equally, there is no question of vulnerable persons being denied rent supplement for the first six months after lodging an application.</P>
        <P>All applicants for rent supplement who have been assessed by a local authority as being in need of housing, receive rent supplement immediately regardless of how long they have been renting in the private sector or even if they never rented before. Nobody who needs rent supplement is refused if they have a housing need.</P>
        <P>If an applicant for rent supplement has not been assessed by a local authority as being in need of housing, they are not excluded from receiving rent supplement on that account. First, a number of categories of people are exempted from the requirement to be assessed by the local authority, including: elderly people; people with disabilities; people regarded as homeless by a local authority; people leaving institutions such as prisons; and existing bona fide private sector tenants, defined as people who have been renting for six months or more, who have an income maintenance need, for example, because they have just become unemployed.</P>
        <P>Second, a person who applies for rent supplement who is not in one of the exempted categories may apply to their local authority for an assessment of their housing need. If the local authority considers that they have a housing need and the local authority cannot immediately meet that housing need, then rent supplement is payable without delay.</P>
        <P>The health boards have discretion to award rent supplement in any cases where they feel it is appropriate to do so even if the person in question is not an existing private sector tenant and does not fall into one of the exempted categories. The instructions issued to health boards on implementing the new arrangements earlier this year state that the new arrangements do not restrict <Col N="609"/>the discretion given to them to award a supplement in any case where it appears to the board that the circumstances of the case so warrant.</P>
        <P>The principal criteria upon which such a determination might be made include the safety and well-bring of the applicant or a situation where an applicant is being made homeless or forced to use homeless facilities unless rent supplement is paid. Such cases could include people who find themselves caught up in violent domestic situations who have to move accommodation because of fears for their safety or well-being. My Department is not aware of anybody in such circumstances who has been refused rent supplement since the new measures were introduced.</P>
        <P>In the past it had been possible for people to refuse a housing offer, or multiple offers, from their local authority in favour of availing indefinitely of rent supplement from the health board for private rented accommodation. Rent supplement is no longer payable to those who refuse two such offers of accommodation from their local authority.</P>
        <P>In a related development, a new initiative announced in July 2004 will progressively transfer responsibility to local authorities for meeting long-term housing needs, including those of people dependent on rent supplement for 18 months or longer. These new arrangements will see local authorities put solutions in place for people with long-term housing needs, while the rent supplement scheme will continue to provide short-term income support in appropriate circumstances. These measures are intended to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to deal with actual housing needs in their areas.</P>
        <P>A working group was established earlier this year under the Sustaining Progress agreement to enable the social partners to assess the impact of the changes to the rent supplement scheme. The working group, which was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, included representatives from ICTU and the community and voluntary pillar, as well as my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This group concluded that the new measures were not having any significant adverse impacts, taking account of the continuing appropriate levels of discretion available to community welfare officers in respect of particularly vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>As previously stated, I have instructed my Department to conduct a review of a number of adjustments to particular welfare schemes that were introduced last year. That review is currently under way and I expect that it will be concluded soon.</P>

	<P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their food needs may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
        <P>Diet supplements are subject to a means test. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical advisor and the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
        <P>The basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement had remained unchanged since 1996. Subsequent increases in social welfare rates and in the cost of special diets had not been taken into account in assessing entitlement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2004, the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation since 1996. In the case of new applicants for diet supplement, the amount of supplement payable is based on revised diet costs, &euro;44 for lower cost diets, or &euro;57 for higher cost diets, less one third of the applicant&rsquo;s income or one sixth of the joint income in the case of a couple. People who were in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations on 1 January 2004 continue to receive their existing rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in their circumstances that would warrant a review of their case.</P>
        <P>In order to inform future consideration of the scheme, my Department has commissioned a short study by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute to establish what constitutes a standard healthy nutritional diet and how the cost of such a diet relates to the current rate of social welfare payments. The study will also examine the special diets currently prescribed in legislation which attract assistance in the form of a diet supplement and examine the appropriate level of assistance required to allow individuals cater for any additional costs involved in providing for special diets. The study is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>As previously stated, I have instructed my Department to conduct a review of a number of adjustments to particular welfare schemes, including alterations to the dietary supplements, that were introduced last year. That review is currently under way and I expect that it will be concluded soon.</P>

	<P>There is no specific number of job applications which would be automatically accepted as evidence that a person is available for or genuinely seeking work. The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 21 September 2004 when, following a review of his claim that took account of all the available evidence, including replies to seven job applications, the deciding officer disallowed the claim on the basis that he was not available for full-time employment and was not genuinely seeking employment.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The appeal has been referred to the appeals officer, who is of the opinion that an oral hearing is required. He will be advised of the date and venue for the hearing when the necessary arrangements have been made.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension, it is necessary for a person to have paid social insurance contributions, at an appropriate rate, over an extended period. The rate structure is designed to enable as many as possible to receive pensions, while at the same time giving appropriate recognition to the different levels of contribution which people have made to the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Government has introduced a number of measures designed to make qualification for old age contributory pensions easier for people with reduced or broken social insurance records. In 1997, the average yearly number of contributions required for a minimum pension was reduced from 20 to ten. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available for people with insurance contributions at different rates or from other EU countries or countries with whom Ireland has signed a bilateral agreement. In addition, special pensions were introduced for those with pre-1953 contributions and for the self-employed who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for that group.</P>
        <P>Rather than creating inequities, the measures introduced, including the creation of half-rate pensions, have enabled many people, who up to 1997 would not have qualified for a payment, to qualify. The pensions being received by those on reduced rate or <i>pro-rata</i> pensions represent a very good return for the contributions paid. All persons are entitled to an old age non-contributory pension, subject to a means test.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider exempting part of payments of redundancy lump <Col N="616"/>sums from the means test for unemployment assistance on condition that this part is put into a pension fund; his estimate of the cost of exempting &euro;50,000 of any lump sum in this way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. Amounts held in occupational pension schemes and personal pension products such as PRSAs and retirement annuity contracts are not assessed as capital for means testing purposes while they are held in such schemes. In addition, the origin of such pension contributions, be it a redundancy lump sum or otherwise, is not relevant in this context.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of persons that are now depending on non-contributory old age pensions; his views on whether many of these, as self-employed persons, were not eligible to make any PRSI contributions until 1988; if he will consider removing the strict means test that is imposed on these persons and provide them with a full pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of September 2004, there were 85,381 people receiving an old age non-contributory pension which represents a decline of over 20% in the last ten years. Figures in relation to the previous employment status of those receiving old age non-contributory pension are not available.</P>
        <P>This decline in the importance of the old age non-contributory pension reflects improved social insurance coverage and increased labour force participation, particularly for women. Successive changes to the social insurance system throughout the period 1974 to 1995 extended coverage to new groups of workers and this extended coverage is resulting in additional numbers now qualifying for contributory payments.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to extending contributory based pensions to as many people as possible through easing the qualifying conditions and catering for special groups who marginally fail to qualify for a pension. However, the basic principle underlying entitlement to social welfare contributory schemes, which requires a certain level and type of social insurance, remains an important feature.</P>
        <P>Self-employed people who were over 56 years in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for the self-employed were one of the groups for whom a special pension was introduced. In April 1999 a flat-rate pension of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, was <Col N="617"/>introduced based of the payment of 260 contributions. There are currently 16,116 people in receipt of the self-employed pension.</P>
        <P>The old age non-contributory pension is a social assistance payment which is designed to provide financial support for older people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes it is payable subject to a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. There are no plans to remove the means test for this pension.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the financial support currently available to help lone parents to re-enter the workforce; and if he will introduce a new back to work scheme to support them.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26533/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The main financial support available to lone parents is the one parent family payment which was introduced in 1997 to replace a number of schemes which catered for different categories of lone parent. These schemes included lone parents allowance, deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit and the non-contributory widow and widower&rsquo;s pension for those with dependent children.</P>
        <P>The one-parent family payment is based on the need for social welfare support for parents with children where a person has not secured adequate, or any maintenance from the spouse or the other parent. One of the objectives of the scheme is to encourage lone parents to consider employment as an alternative to welfare dependency, while at the same time supporting them to remain in the home if they so wish. It is generally accepted that one of the most effective routes out <Col N="618"/>of poverty for people in the active age groups is through paid employment.</P>
        <P>The main element of this policy is an earnings disregard of &euro;146.50 per week. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of &euro;293 per week. The earnings disregard is designed to facilitate lone parents in entering or re-entering the workforce by enabling them retain entitlement to their payments until they become established in employment. It also facilitates them in availing of training opportunities to prepare them for employment. Lone parents who exceed the upper income limit applying under the scheme may qualify for the family income supplement. This scheme is designed to provide income support for employees on low earnings with children. It helps to &ldquo;make work pay&rdquo; for employees with children in circumstances where otherwise they might only be marginally better off in work than if claiming other social welfare payments. The employment support services currently in place in my Department offer a number of options which are designed to assist certain social welfare recipients, including lone parents, return to work. These options are provided through the Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators who assist people to access work, training or further education.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce. Courses covered under the scheme range from second level through to third level courses of study. Persons awarded the allowance receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the relevant social welfare payment prior to participation. An annual cost of education allowance of &euro;254 is also payable. Almost 1,300 lone parents availed of the scheme in the 2003-04 academic year.</P>
        <P>The back to work allowance scheme is designed to assist the return to work by allowing persons to retain a reducing rate of their social welfare payment over a three-year period, when they take up employment, or four years, if entering self-employment. The allowance is payable to employees at 75% in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in year three. For those engaged in self employment the allowance is payable at 100% in the first year and at 75%, 50%, and 25%, respectively, over the following three years. There are currently 1,204 lone parents on the scheme, 337 of whom are self employed. The impact and effectiveness of these provisions and schemes is being kept under review, in pursuit of the commitment given in my Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. The main purpose of the review is to establish the extent to which obstacles remain to recipients taking up employment. Account will be taken in the review of the <Col N="619"/>research carried out to date, not least the review of the one parent family payment, published by my Department in September 2000 and the OECD review of family-friendly policies, &ldquo;Babies and Bosses&rdquo; Volume II, published in November 2003, which contained a detailed analysis of the position in Ireland from a cross-country perspective. The entire OECD study is currently being finalised and conclusions and recommendations, which will inform my Department&rsquo;s review, are expected shortly. Account is also being taken of policies and programmes pursued in other EU countries, as set out in their national action plans on social inclusion.</P>

	<P>Social welfare legislation places an obligation on people applying for a means-tested payment to disclose their full means at time of application and to notify my Department of any subsequent changes. The requirement to submit a schedule of assets in the case of deceased old age non-contributory pensioners is to ensure that the correct rate of pension was payable for the duration of the person&rsquo;s entitlement. There is provision in legislation for the recovery of any overpayments from the assets of the deceased&rsquo;s estate. The number of means-tested pension cases where my Department assessed overpayments since 2000 is as follows.</P>

	<P>I welcome the study, to which the Deputy refers, and like many others am concerned at its findings. It demonstrates the urgency of the action required to combat poverty, which impacts on our most vulnerable citizens, especially our children.</P>
        <P>The study is based on a sample of 187 children drawn from 79 households in Tallaght west. The area differs from the average in this country in the following important respects. The population is much younger than the average, 54% under 25, compared with the national average of 37%, and 33% under 15, compared with the national average of 21%; almost 7% of the population lives with a disability of whom 14.6% are under 15 years age, compared with an national average of 5.3%; the proportion unemployed, at 10.6%, is more than twice the national average, while a further 4.6% are unable to work; almost one in three, 32.6%, of households are headed by a lone parent, with just under 24% of lone parent households having a child under 15 years, compared to national averages of 12% and 5.3% respectively; the numbers leaving education early are significantly higher than the national averages. Those living in the area are, therefore, at a much higher risk of poverty than the national average.</P>
        <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, which has been in operation since 1997, is being constantly developed, a process being co-ordinated by the office for social inclusion in my Department. It is designed to meet the type of challenges highlighted by this study. A report on implementation of the plan for the period 2003 to 2004 is being finalised and will be published shortly. It is intended that this will provide a basis for evaluation of the progress made so far in combating poverty and social exclusion and what the priorities should be for further action. The evaluation will take place in consultation with the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and other interested parties, with a view to a report being forwarded to the EU in June.</P>
        <P>A key priority will be to further develop a more effective regional and locally based approach to combating poverty, within the context of the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID programme. This programme, launched in 2001, is designed to improve the quality and delivery of services and facilities in identified areas of urban disadvantage, which includes parts of west Tallaght. The ongoing review of the NAPS will examine how national policies in areas such as income and employment supports, child care, health, and education can be better integrated with locally based services to combat more effectively concentrations of poverty, especially in areas of deprivation. Above all it will seek to identify priorities for immediate action, given the urgency of significantly improving the well being of the children, whose situation is so well documented in the study.</P><Col N="621"/>
        <P>The findings of studies such as this are being fully taken into account in this process. I have also asked my officials to contact the authors of the study with a view to discussing their findings and identifying other priorities for action.</P>

        <Quest> the five measurable performance indicators which he regards as target of greatest priority within his Department; the way in which this measure has changed in each year since 1997; his views on whether confining priorities to five indicators gives too partial a picture of departmental priorities; and if he will indicate the movement over the period 1997 to 2004 of other primary indicators of performance.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy suggests, the range of activities in which my Department is involved makes it difficult to convey an adequate picture of the Department&rsquo;s performance through a small number of specific indicators.</P>
        <P>The process of producing period statements of strategy, as Departments are now required to do under the Public Service Management Act 1997, requires that Departments set out key objectives and performance indicators for the different areas of business in which the Departments are engaged. The learning process which this involves is helping to clarify the key indicators of progress for Departments in delivering on their remit. </P>
        <P>The production of performance indicators also requires investment of resources in technology to support this. In that regard the management information framework project which is being implemented as part if the programme of modernisation of the public service will enable the production of more comprehensive indicators and improved systems for measuring and reporting on inputs, outputs and outcomes.</P>
        <P>Over the period since 1997, my Department has used a range of indicators to measure progress on the delivery of its responsibilities. The key areas in relation to which performance is measured are, first, customer satisfaction, second, processing times for new claims and, third, the level and effectiveness of control and anti-fraud activity.</P>
        <P>In relation to customer satisfaction, my Department carries out periodic surveys of customers and consultation exercises to determine levels of satisfaction and obtain views on the service provided. While these surveys show consistently high levels of overall customer satisfaction, the exercises are used to identify specific areas where improvement is required and to target resources towards these areas.</P>
        <P>In relation to processing times, my Department publishes a set of targets covering the different payment schemes for which it is responsible and these are used to assess performance and to redirect resources where necessary. Between <Col N="622"/>1997 and 2003, the number of claims in payment by the Department rose by 8.6% with particularly high levels of increases in certain scheme areas. These increases have presented a significant challenge to the Department in maintaining overall service levels over this period.</P>
        <P>In relation to control activity, the Department&rsquo;s control strategy involves a wide range of measures and activities to control fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. The main indicator of performance in this regard is the amount of savings arising from control activities. The overall amount involved increased by 53% between 1997 and 2002.</P>

	<P>Comhairle, which comes under the aegis of this Department and is the national agency responsible for information, advice and advocacy on social services, funds a network of citizen&rsquo;s information centres around the country. Citizen&rsquo;s information centres provide comprehensive information on the full range of social services available to citizens from state and voluntary agencies.</P>
        <P>The citizen&rsquo;s information centre in question receives its core funding from F&Aacute;S under the social economy programme. Comhairle provided a supplementary grant of &euro;95,630 to the centre in 2004 which enabled the centre to have a level of staffing that is above the norm for CICs. The social economy programme is due to finish in mid-November 2004 and F&Aacute;S has indicated that it does not intend to allocate any further funding to the centre. The board of Crumlin CIC was informed in 2001 by Comhairle that on the conclusion of the social economy programme in November 2004, the centre would have to revert to staffing levels that are consistent with citizens information centres countrywide.</P>
        <P>To develop further outreach services, Comhairle has decided to provide funding for an additional part-time information officer post. Staffing levels will be reviewed on a yearly basis with the board of the CIC and additional resources allocated if deemed appropriate.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person is regarded as being engaged in systematic short-time working where his or her full-time working week is reduced by his or her employer due to a downturn in business and where there is a clear repetitive pattern of employment each week. The number of days of benefit payable each week to a systematic short-time worker is limited to ensure that the total number of days paid and the number of days worked do not exceed five.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the criteria for classification as a casual worker are also set out in legislation. A person who is not classified as either a casual worker or a systematic short-time worker is considered to be a part-time worker for unemployment benefit purposes.</P>
        <P>Where it comes to light that a systematic short-time arrangement no longer applies, it is open to the deciding officer to re-classify the claimant as either a part-time or casual employee, and to revise the unemployment benefit claim accordingly. The date from which the revision is effective depends on the circumstances of the individual case in accordance with the criteria set out in legislation. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer, he or she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

I am <Col N="624"/>informed, however, that the runway was never extended beyond 7,500 feet and it was withdrawn from service in 1990.

        <P>Under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, as amended by the State Airports Act 2004, Dublin Airport Authority, formally Aer Rianta, is responsible for any proposals to compulsorily acquire land in accordance with sections 17 and 18 of the 1998 Act.

Since the coming into force of the 1998 Act, my Department has not compulsorily acquired land at the State airports nor has it lodged objections or appeals in connection with planning applications at the airports.</P>
        <P>As regards the period preceding the coming into force of the 1998 Act, I do not believe that I could justify the significant use of resources and expense required to examine relevant records, which date back as far as the 1930s. However, if the Deputy wishes to write to me in relation to any particular compulsory acquisition order at a State airport or in relation to an objection or appeal concerning a particular planning appli<Col N="625"/>cation, my Department will endeavour to assist with his inquiry in a helpful and practical manner.</P>

The interpretation of law is a matter for the courts.</P>
        <P>In a reply to a similar question on 29 June 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Brennan, pointed out that the High Court, in a judicial review case between Mr. Sean Liddy and the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Irish Aviation Authority, Aer Rianta Teoranta, Ireland and the Attorney General, ruled in February 2003 that the use of either section 14 orders or the planning process is permissible for restricting development in the vicinity of airports.</P>

	<P>The statutory basis for the use of cycle tracks is set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The regulations provide for two types of cycle tracks. The first is delineated by the provision of a full white line. Mechanically propelled vehicles may not be driven along or across such a cycle track except for the purpose of accessing or egressing a place adjacent to the track. That restriction does not apply in respect of a cycle track that is delineated by a broken white line.</P>
        <P>The offence of breaching restrictions on driving a vehicle on a cycle track is scheduled in the Road Traffic Act 2002 to be rolled out as a penalty <Col N="626"/>point offence. A driver who commits this offence will incur three penalty points on conviction in court and one penalty point on payment of a fixed charge in lieu of going to court. The aforementioned 1997 and 1998 regulations also prohibit parking in a cycle track. That offence will not attract penalty points as is the case in respect of all parking offences with the exception of the offence of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position.</P>

	<P>Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority in its annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report is in respect of 2002 and that report, with reports relating to previous years, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The 2002 report shows that, in respect of Dublin city, four motorcyclists were killed and 235 were injured. This compares with a total of 44 motorcyclists killed and 971 injured nationally during that year. Of that total figure, 12 drivers and two passengers killed were not wearing helmets and 231 drivers and 18 passengers were injured while not wearing helmets.</P>
        <P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp;  Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus-based public transport. The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
        <P>An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. However, representations have been received by my Department seeking to extend access to bus lanes with regard to a wide range of other road users including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists. A review of the access issue was carried out in 2001. As part of that review, the views of the director of traffic in Dublin City Council, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were sought. All of those <Col N="627"/>bodies suggested there should be no change to the current position. I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users.</P>

        <P>There are no plans to amend the legislation since, of itself, the absence of a motor tax disc or an insurance disc does not necessarily mean that motor tax has not been paid or that motor insurance cover is not in place and would not therefore constitute sufficient grounds for forming such opinion.

	<P>I am informed by Irish Rail that since 1994 over &euro;50 million has been invested in the Mallow-Tralee railway line. This involved the total relaying of the line and the replacement of old track with new continuous welded rail, CWR, and the upgrading of customer facilities on the route. The Kerry route re-signalling project, which commenced in February 2004, is due to be completed in the spring of 2005. The project involves the replacing of the old semaphore mechanical signalling system by a computer-controlled colour light signalling system on the Tralee-Mallow section of the line. The re-signalling project is designed to deliver significant service improvements to rail customers who use the Tralee-Dublin route.</P>
        <P>Irish Rail has already placed a &euro;116 million order for a fleet of 67 new purpose built <Delete>I</Delete><Insert>i</Insert>nter<Delete>C</Delete><Insert>c</Insert>ity carriages. When delivered late next year, they will be used on all Cork-Dublin services, and when the full fleet is in service in 2006, they will allow Irish Rail to deliver an hourly service in each direction on the Cork-Dublin route. They will also allow the carriages currently operating <Col N="628"/>on the Cork-Dublin route to be allocated to other routes, including the services to Kerry.</P>
        <P>In the December 2004 timetable, a number of additional services were introduced to facilitate travel on the line between Tralee and Cork and I understand that these services are proving popular with Irish Rail&rsquo;s customers.</P>

	<P>I would firstly like to welcome this report, which has highlighted a number of issues facing the community in west Tallaght. As the Deputy is aware, this matter is being debated in the House this week in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; motion and I took the opportunity during the first part of that debate yesterday evening to fully outline the extent of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to respond positively to the recommendations in the report.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Government is committed to the continued effort to address the challenge of anti-social behaviour. This effort includes such initiatives as the ongoing Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na youth diversion projects and juvenile diversion programme which operate in communities nationwide, including Tallaght. A review is ongoing by Garda management of current and future accommodation requirements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Tallaght, with a number of different options being considered with a view to finalising proposals in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Government has given an ongoing commitment of significant funding for the support and creation of child care places in the Tallaght <Col N="631"/>area, with over &euro;4.4 million allocated to the area to date for this purpose. The improvement in early school provision is also a priority through initiatives such as the provision of Early Start pre-school places for children at risk of social disadvantage. Other educational measures include reading support programmes and extra teaching resources to decrease pupil-teacher ratios. Additional support to reduce early school-leaving is provided through the disadvantaged areas scheme and the school completion programme.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to further improve the environment in the estates surveyed and continue with the housing estate enhancement scheme initiated this year under the RAPID programme. Some &euro;7 million of investment in RAPID areas under the second phase of the equality for women measure is earmarked for projects benefiting women in these areas and includes a number of applications from groups in the west Tallaght area. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expects to be in a position to allocate funding under the measure by the end of the year. The Government is also developing mechanisms which will lead to better delivery by the RAPID programme, including better local co-ordination, the leverage fund for small works, and the ring-fencing of funds under the dormant accounts fund towards RAPID areas. We will continue to develop the RAPID initiative in all its strands beyond 2006, including an ongoing commitment to the further prioritisation of RAPID areas in decision-making by Departments.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, section 10(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003 provides for the simultaneous publication in both official languages of a limited number of key governance documents such as annual reports and accounts. The area partnership companies are public bodies for the purposes of the Act. An annual report is one of the key documents by which public bodies account back to the general public, to their specific customers and to the Oireachtas in relation to how they have, in the previous year, discharged their public functions.</P>
        <P>The question of provision of funding for specific administrative costs for individual public bodies &mdash; whether these relate to the Official Languages Act or any other service delivery or policy obligation arising &mdash; falls to be assessed against formal business cases or proposals submitted as part of the normal annual Estimates <Col N="632"/>and budget cycle. Given its position as the first constitutional language, my objective is to ensure that delivery through the Irish language of public services by public bodies &mdash; including provision of information about services and activities &mdash; is seen as normal and appropriate to meet minimum standards of customer service. With regard to area development partnerships, the position is that each partnership receives an overall sum of funding to meet its operational costs and, within that overall amount, is responsible for managing its various spending requirements and priorities.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the extent to which a number of public bodies have incorporated, even in advance of the Official Languages Act being implemented, Irish language publications and website material into the mainstream of their service provision.</P>

	<P>The person named stated that he wished to apply for premium on 25 animals under the 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 suckler cow premium schemes, 25 being the number of quota rights on record for him. While he submitted 25 cattle identity cards with his 2001 application, he only submitted 12, 16, and 20 cattle identity cards respectively with the other applications. He has not been paid on foot of these applications because of delays in replying to queries issued to him concerning the identification and registration of some of the animals to which his application related. A final decision on eligibility for payments on the 2001 and 2002 applications will be taken in the coming week by my Department and will be notified in writing to the person named. He is being given more time to answer the queries with regard to the 2003 and 2004 applications.</P><Col N="634"/>
        <P>The person named lodged no applications under the 2001, 2003 and 2004 EU special beef premium scheme. An application was received under the 2002 special beef premium scheme on 31 December 2002 in respect of two animals. Payment on this application cannot be processed until outstanding suckler cow queries are resolved. Eligibility for the 2001 EU slaughter premium has been determined in respect of one animal. However, payment did not issue in respect of this animal as the person named did not return a duly completed producer acknowledgement form to my Department. Should the person named return this form at this stage, payment will be considered.</P>
        <P>With regard to the extensification premium, the person named participated in these schemes in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. For 2001 and 2002, he opted for the census system for the purposes of determining the stocking density of his holding. To be considered for payment under both years&rsquo; schemes, herd owners must have submitted the CEN.1 and CEN.2 forms, declaring the numbers of bovine animals present on their holdings at each census date. The person named did not lodge these forms with his local district livestock office and, for this reason, he cannot be considered for payment of the premium. With regard to the 2003 extensification premium, the position is that the stocking density of the holding cannot be determined until the outstanding issues already highlighted with regard to the identification and registration of animals have been resolved. Payment of the extensification premium where due is based on the numbers of animals on the holding on which the herd owner in question has already qualified for payment of the suckler cow premium and-or the special beef premium. The person named has also submitted an application under the 2004 extensification premium scheme. Payments under this scheme will commence in June 2005. The application will be considered in due course.</P>
        <P>Payments under the 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 area based compensatory allowance scheme were made to the person named on 24 September 2001, 16 October 2002, 19 September 2003 and 17 September 2004 respectively. The final year payment under a REPS 1 contract issued to the person named in February 2002. He has not made an application to re-join REPS since then.</P>

        <P>The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. No decision regarding the allocation of the proposed increase in the strength of the force has been made to date.</P>
        <P>Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to increase significantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing and will have a real impact.</P>
        <P>Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review by Garda management and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Garda stations in the DMR will be fully <Col N="641"/>considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

        <P>I am further informed that these vehicles are disposed of in two ways. First, vehicles may be reclaimed by their owners on production of documentation indicating that the vehicle has the relevant motor tax and insurance and upon payment of the fees which have occurred since the date of seizure. Second, vehicles which are not reclaimed by owners are disposed of by way of scrappage once sanction has been given by the Garda Commissioner. This can happen with or without owner consent.</P>
        <P>Currently, all vehicles which have been seized are stored at Tallaght Garda station. However, I understand from the Garda authorities that the Garda national traffic bureau is examining the issues pertaining to the seizure, storage and disposal of vehicles seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Acts. As part of this examination, the Garda national crime prevention office has held preliminary discussions with South Dublin County Council and the matter is currently being pursued by the Garda national traffic bureau.</P>

	<P>As the cost of child care is normally a commercial arrangement between parent and provider the State does not have a role in the collection of data on costs such as is sought by the Deputy. However, in order to establish a clear picture in relation to the child care sector, my Department asked the Central Statistics Office to review child care as an element of the quarterly national household survey and this was completed in the period from September to November 2002 and the findings of which were published in mid 2003.</P>
        <P>The survey found that the average cost of child care per hour for pre-school and primary school-going children in the September to November 2002 period was &euro;3.25 and &euro;4.70 per hour respectively. The survey also provided a breakdown of the average cost of paid child care per household per week for pre-school and primary school-going children in different regions of the country.

        <P FLI="0">The child care sector in Ireland comprises both community based and privately owned centre based services together with a significant element of child care delivered by childminders. In the year 2000, there were about 56,000 centre based child care places in Ireland of which 39,500 were part time places and 17,285 were full time places. It is known that the total funding committed under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, to date will lead to the creation of 31,200 new centre based child care places &mdash; 12,704 full-time and 18,496 part-time &mdash; when all the projects have been completed. Of these new places, about 12,500 part-time and 8,000 full-time places were completed by end June 2004.</P>
        <P>However, my Department does not have the detail of the number of new services which have been developed independently of the EOCP. My child care directorate is currently concluding an update of the key elements of the 2000 census of centre based services and this material will be lodged in the Oireachtas Library when it comes available. It will contain data on a county basis.</P><Col N="644"/>
        <P>In the interim, the Deputy will be aware that detail on the implementation of the equal opportunities child care programme was circulated to all Deputies in the report, Developing Childcare in Ireland, during summer 2004. I expect to lodge an update of these data in the Oireachtas Library later this year.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, it is not, understandably, possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for Garda CCTV systems relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P>To this end, a grant-aid scheme has been launched to facilitate community-based groups who wish to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such systems.</P>
        <P>A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. I am advised that in excess of 200 expressions of interest in this scheme have been received from entities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The code of practice for the operation of the community based CCTV scheme has been drawn up by my Department in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. Detailed technical specifications have been drawn up by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are currently under consideration by officials in my Department.</P>
        <P>I expect that both the code of practice and the technical specifications will be finalised by my Department in the coming weeks. At that stage copies of same will issue to all communities and organisations who have expressed an interest in the community based CCTV scheme. Any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed in accordance with the conditions set out in the prospectus.</P>

The applicant stated on his visa application form that he is a student in his home country, yet no documentation was submitted to support this claim. No evidence of finances was submitted to show how the applicant intended to maintain himself while in the State. The application was supported by an unsigned letter which did not confirm the duration of the proposed journey to the State. The application was refused because the visa officer was unable to conclude, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department, enclosing additional supporting documentation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 310 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has responsibility for the delivery of the equal opportunities child care programme which aims to expand the availability of child care places to support the child care needs of parents who are in employment, education and training. My Department is not involved in the direct delivery of child care services, which in Ireland is done by a mix of community based and private providers of centre based services and by childminders. As a result, no data are systematically gathered on the percentages and numbers of children in the zero to two age group who are cared for in cr&egrave;ches, or in the three to four age group who are in receipt of pre-school education.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, quarterly national household survey on child care usage which was published in mid 2003 does provide some data which may be of interest to the Deputy. In the September to November 2002 period, when the survey was undertaken, it was estimated that 36,700 pre-school children availed of child care in the cr&egrave;che-Montessori category, with a further 6,100 primary children using the category cr&egrave;che-Montessori. In that survey, the CSO grouped a number of child care services under the category cr&egrave;che or Montessori, namely, cr&egrave;che, na&iacute;onra, nursery, Montessori school, playgroup, pre-school, and sessional child care.</P>

        <P>I believe this is an opportune moment to ensure that the criteria for entry meet the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the society it serves. One particular aspect which I know the Commissioner has already studied is the maximum age of entry, and arising from that I will be proposing to Government that the age should be increased from 26 to 35 in respect of recruitment from now on. There may also be other criteria which would benefit from review. I think it is right, for example, that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society, and I am anxious to see if there are any possible changes to the existing criteria which might facilitate recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our community. This review will be concluded in advance of the next Garda recruitment campaign, which I expect to commence shortly.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the equal opportunities child care programme provides grant assistance towards the staffing costs of community not-for-profit based child care services which have a clear focus on disadvantage. The programme has an underlying economic prerogative in terms of promoting opportunities for parents to participate in education, training or employment. Such applications are assessed against five distinct criteria, as set out in the programmes guidelines, which are as follows: the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the general quality of the application; the capacity of the group to implement the project; the level of integration/co-ordination of the <Col N="649"/>service; and the cost and value for money of the project.   </P>
        <P>  With respect to the application referred to by the Deputy I have made inquiries of the child care directorate of my Department and I understand that the original application from this group was turned down in July 2003 because their application did not adequately satisfy all the criteria of the programme. The group subsequently appealed this decision and, in June 2004, were informed that their appeal had been unsuccessful. </P>
        <P>The group was informed of the reasons why their application was turned down. Staffing grant assistance is only made available to community based not for profit groups which show a clear focus on disadvantage and which support the child care needs of parents who are in employment or who are preparing for labour market participation through education and training. This project failed to demonstrate a strong focus on disadvantage while the service catered for a very small core group of children and the short operating hours did not facilitate parents to access either education, training or employment. Accordingly the project did not comply with the terms of the programme and therefore was not eligible for funding which is linked to the aims of the European Social Funds as the key funding source for staffing grant assistance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 323 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to the childminder development grant that forms part of the national child minding initiative. I launched the national childminders initiative in November 2003 as part of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. Funding of up to &euro;2.89 million has been made available to the city and county child care committees for the implementation of the initiative during 2004. Funding for the 2005 implementation of the initiative is currently under review by my Department.</P>
        <P>The initiative links a small development grant scheme for childminders to a quality awareness programme, QAP, which consists of a series of short lectures for child minders addressing quality issues. The development grant scheme provides <Col N="650"/>grants of up &euro;630, subject to a maximum of 90% of total expenditure, to childminders to cover quality and/or safety enhancement costs.</P>
        <P>The initiative is implemented locally by the city and county child care committees. A review of the initiative by my Department in August 2004 revealed that by end June 2004, 325 childminders had received grant approval while over 900 childminders attended the QAP in its first six months of operation. At that time, an additional 117 grant applications were being processed with over 300 childminders scheduled to attend the QAP. Figures for applications that have been rejected are not available, but are thought to be negligible at this stage.</P>
        <P>Given that this is a new initiative and that the city and county child care committees have only had a limited amount of time to implement this new initiative, particularly in setting up the quality awareness training element, I am very pleased with the initial response and believe that this initiative will serve as a very useful support for childminders. I expect that there will be a significant increase in the number of grants taken up as the initiative becomes widely recognised.</P>
        <P>To obtain the development grant, childminders must provide an expenditure return detailing their eligible expenditure with original itemised receipts attached. This ensures that all successful applicants of the development grant are or will be engaged in child minding of children, other than their own children, on a commercial basis and be in receipt of payment for the services provided. In light of this, the development grant could be seen to be a start-up grant as well as a quality improvement grant.</P>
        <P>In light of the above and given the relatively small amounts of money involved in each grant offer and the large number of potential grant recipients, which could exceed 3,000 in a single full year of operation, I have no plans to change the payment procedures of the child minder development grant scheme as proposed by the Deputies, as this would be administratively cumbersome and expensive to operate and monitor.</P>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In recognition of the many achievements of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 up to December 2003 the funding for the programme was recently increased to &euro;449.3 million following the mid-term evaluation of the national development plan. Every locality has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector.</P>
        <P>The total funding committed under the equal opportunities child care programme up to the end of September 2004 is over &euro;264.3 million. Over 2,600 grants have been awarded to child care providers and community groups, which will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of approximately 29,700 new child care places, and will support almost 28,000 existing places. In the Dublin 12 area alone funding, totalling &euro; 2.25 million, under the programme has been allocated to 17 projects to date. This funding will lead to the creation of an additional 261 new child care places in the area and will support a further 403 existing places.</P>
        <P>I understand that there are a number of applications on hand in my Department for capital grant assistance to establish new services in the Dublin 12 area. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of &euro;114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to end 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5- ?>
        <P>In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP including the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme&rsquo;s <Col N="657"/>objectives and this has brought to &euro;157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently exceeds &euro;30 million, of which about &euro;25 million is being earmarked for community based not for profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.</P>
        <P>I understand that the recommendations in relation to the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight time frame. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it may be considered again should additional capital resources come available and if the project has adequately demonstrated that it would merit funding under the programme during the review process. The allocation of any additional funding which might come available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>

	<P>There are 703 Garda stations in the country. PULSE is available at 181 locations including divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations throughout the country. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. Garda personnel in other stations have also the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly. It is considered by the Garda authorities that the correct balance between cost and availability has been achieved with this level of coverage.</P>
        <P>However, this is a matter to be kept under review in the light of advances in technologies and experience gained from the use of the system over time. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a decision has recently been made to carry out such a review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336, 350, 358 and 366 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the proposed new system for resource teacher allocation involves a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs &mdash; borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability &mdash; and those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The proposed allocation mechanism is as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher <Col N="663"/>incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.</P>
        <P>In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. The rationale for a pupil teacher ratio of 150 pupils for every teacher in mixed schools to support pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and learning difficulties/delays is that the pupil teacher ratio for a learning support teacher was approximately 300 pupils; 10% of pupils would be expected to have learning difficulties in the fields of literacy and numeracy and, on that basis, approximately 15 out of a group of 150 pupils would be expected to have learning difficulties. This is considered half of a teacher&rsquo;s caseload. A further 3%, or 4/5 pupils, in this cohort would be expected to have higher-incidence special educational needs and would expect to receive 2.5 resource teaching hours per week. This would account for the other half of a teacher&rsquo;s caseload.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the different pupil teacher ratios in boys&rsquo;&mdash; 140:1 &mdash; and girls&rsquo;&mdash; 200:1 &mdash; schools is twofold. First, international literature on the incidence of disability indicates that, across all disability types, there is a greater incidence in boys than in girls. Second, international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy have found that these difficulties are more common among boys than girls.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the level of support proposed for schools in areas of urban disadvantage is that evidence shows that there is a significantly higher incidence of literacy and numeracy difficulties in urban disadvantaged compared to other schools, including those in areas of rural disadvantage.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that applications may be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs regardless of gender of pupil or status of school.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise with the proposed model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I will be reviewing the model to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year.</P>

	<P>My Department received an application for refurbishment from the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy in May 1998. A design team was appointed on 23 September 1999 to commence the architectural planning of the project and to examine a number of options to provide improved accommodation for the school. Following an examination of the options presented it was decided to proceed with the provision of a new school building.</P>
        <P>The stage 1/2/3 report &mdash; developed plans/costs &mdash; was approved by my Department on 2 May 2001 and approval was given to the board of management to proceed to stage 4/5. The building project is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning and has a band 3 rating.</P>
        <P>My Department is not in a position to indicate the estimated cost for the project as this is regarded as commercially sensitive information. The total amount spent on the building project to date is &euro;58,942.84. My officials are nearing completion of a review of all projects which did not proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual programme from 2005.

	<P>Earlier this year the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, introduced a new planning model for educational infrastructure to ensure that, in future, school provision will be decided after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested <Col N="665"/>parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</P>
        <P>The main feature of the new model, being introduced initially on a pilot basis in five specific areas, is the publication of an area development plan which will set out a blueprint for education infrastructure in the particular area into the future.</P>
        <P>The components of the draft area development plan are as follows: details of existing primary and post primary provision; examination of the demographics of the area; commentary on the data; and recommendations for the area into the future.</P>
        <P>Following publication of each draft area development plan, the Commission on School Accommodation will conduct a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process in each case will culminate in the publication of a final area development plan against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.</P>
        <P>The location of the proposed new school to which the Deputy refers is being considered through the process outlined above, as it forms part of one of the pilot area development plans, for which the draft area development plan will be published in the near future.</P>

	<P>An internal committee of my Department meets from time to time to ensure effective liaison in the area of special educational needs. It includes representatives of the inspectorate, special education section and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. As part of its work, the committee commissioned a screening project with the aim of informing policy and practice on the effective use of resources to support children with special educational needs, including children with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The project was overseen by NEPS, with assistance from the educational research centre in St Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra. It involved the assessment of all pupils in second to sixth class in mainstream primary schools in the town of Dundalk and in the county of Leitrim. Teachers in 55 schools administered group tests of cognitive ability and of reading and mathematical attainment to 3,897 pupils and also completed questionnaires on individual pupils, on concerns not amenable to normal screening methods.</P>
        <P>Statistical analysis of the results has proved to be time consuming, but I understand that the final report on the project will be presented to me before the end of 2004. I shall consider the findings in the report with my officials and decide on the appropriate response.</P>

	<P>The new school building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. It has a band 2 rating. My Department&rsquo;s technical staff are currently examining stage 3 documentation, covering detailed plans and costs, and the school authorities will be kept advised of developments.</P>
        <P>My officials are nearing completion of a review of all projects, which did not proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual programme from 2005. All projects are being assessed against the published prioritisation criteria, agreed earlier this year with the education partners. Each project will be assigned a band rating and the progress of all projects will be considered in the context of the programme from 2005. Following conclusion of the current Estimates and budgetary process I intend to publish the 2005 building programme, which will operate in a multi-annual framework.</P>

The school authorities were informed in a letter dated 26 August 2004 that the pupil did not meet the criteria for such support under the relevant Department circulars. Additional supporting documentation was submitted to my Department recently.

	<P>The Registration Council is the statutory body which determines, with the approval of the Minister for Education and Science, the qualification requirements for the purpose of registration as a secondary teacher. The council prescribes that each applicant for registration as a secondary teacher must, among other requirements, hold a relevant third level qualification which in the opinion of the council, is adequate to enable the holder to teach at least one of the approved subjects or areas of study approved for the purpose of a course of instruction as set out in the rules and programme for secondary schools together with a suitable training in teaching qualification acceptable to the council which is directed towards the age range 12- 18 years.</P>
        <P>Applications for the recognition of qualifications for the purpose of registration are considered by the council at meetings, which take place on a periodic basis. For the council to assess the suitability of qualifications for teaching purposes, full details of the courses of study pursued must be submitted.

	<P>At present, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS has 127 psychologists in including 67 psychologists at entry level. Five more psychologists are due to take up employment in NEPS, three in November and two others shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>Recruitment of permanent staff to the Department, including psychologists has, to date, been undertaken by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, OCSLAC, under the terms of the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956. The commissioners have provided an independent recruitment and selection service to Departments. The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 was recently enacted. The OCSLAC no longer exists but has been replaced by two new bodies. The Commission for Public Service Appointments is now the regulatory body for recruitment, while the Public Appointments Service will provide a recruitment, selection and advisory service. The legislation also broadens the options to Departments and Civil Service offices by enabling them to undertake their own recruitment.</P>
        <P>The current Civil Service Commission panel of 69 psychologists has recently been exhausted and discussions regarding a new panel will commence shortly. Further recruitment of psychologists to NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>
        <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS to cover all schools, those that are not yet served may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessment, SCPA. The SCPA is an interim measure and was specifically introduced to minimise delays for those children who need to be assessed. Under this scheme, individual psychological assessments may only be administered by psychologists whose names appear on a panel compiled by NEPS. Psychologists on the panel are private practitioners who have satisfied NEPS that they are graduate members of the Psychological Society of Ireland or the British Psychological Society; that they are registered or chartered psychologists or, if not, that they have at least one year&rsquo;s supervised experience of administering psychological tests to children; that they have obtained Garda clearance; and that their tax affairs are in order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 361 together.</P>
        <P>We must respect the fact that education systems across the EU differ in how they prepare children and young people for participation in social and economic life, for active citizenship and for lifelong learning. The education system in Northern Ireland is closely aligned with that of England, Scotland and Wales and differs to that in the Republic, especially in regard to the treatment of upper secondary education.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has carried out a comprehensive public consultation process on the future direction of senior cycle education in Ireland. This concluded with the publication by the NCCA of Directions for Development &mdash; Developing Senior Cycle Education, which was presented at a national forum in Dublin Castle on 23 September 2003. The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals for reform build on extensive <Col N="674"/>consultation with stakeholders in Ireland as well as on research on developments in upper secondary education internationally.</P>
        <P>The NCCA has submitted initial advice on the reforms in June 2004. This will be followed by a second stage at the end of the year which will include an elaboration of the possible configuration of subjects, short courses and transition units, details of how assessment might be managed, an analysis of the implications for staff development and infrastructure, and a detailed action plan for implementing the proposal. This will enable decisions to be made on implementation issues.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate to seek to harmonise our education systems. Rather, policy is focused on seeking agreement on the alignment of the various levels of qualification in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales, so that there will be clarity as to what levels qualifications are broadly comparable. This will provide important information for learners, employers and education institutions.</P>
        <P>In that context, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland has hosted a network of qualifications and regulatory authorities in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom to promote co-operation and share practice, and consider the potential for aligning frameworks of qualifications and levels, or agreeing linkages. The network has had a number of meetings and a process is under way to develop a &ldquo;ready reckoner&rdquo; which will show key points of convergence of qualifications levels within the frameworks across the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This is expected to be ready at the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, a North-South working group has been established, co-chaired by officials from the Department of Education and Science in the Republic and Department of Employment and Learning in the North to identify where recognition arrangements are not in place and need to be advanced and to report and make proposals in this area.</P>
        <P>On 6 February 2004 it was announced that Irish leaving certificate awards at ordinary and higher level would be included, with effect from 2006, in the UCAS tariff, the points system for admission to higher education colleges in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
        <P>In addition, the work is progressing at EU level on the implementation of the Bologna and Copenhagen process regarding common approaches to the transparency and quality of qualifications in higher education and vocational education and training, and is beginning on the development of a European framework of qualifications. The developments in Ireland regarding the national framework of qualifications in Ireland are attracting considerable international interest in that context.</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P>During the Irish Presidency of the EU political agreement was reached on Europass, a set of transparency tools to improve information on qualifications, work experience and language proficiency which are now being introduced across the EU. Political agreement was reached on a draft consolidated EU directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.</P>
        <P>A key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</P>
        <P>The wide variety of measures in place in Tallaght and in other similar areas for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflect these concerns. These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth and in providing second chance education for young people and adults.</P>
        <P>As part of the roll out of services of the National Educational Welfare Board, which is the national body with responsibility for school attendance, four educational welfare officers have been assigned to the Tallaght area. The school completion programme is my Department&rsquo;s main programme for tackling early school leaving. There are six school completion clusters in Tallaght, comprising six post-primary and 19 primary schools. The Tallaght youth service has been allocated funding of &euro;700,000 to help targeted groups, including early school leavers, young mothers and Travellers. My Department also provides support for second chance education in west Tallaght through the Youthreach <Col N="676"/>programme, the back to education initiative, and the local senior Traveller training centre.</P>
        <P>Despite the range of difficulties identified in the report referred to by the Deputy, 68% of the parents surveyed for it reported that their child was achieving his or her potential at school. I welcome the report as a useful contribution to this complex area of policy and I have asked my officials to consider its wider policy implications in the context of finalising work on an overall review of educational disadvantage programmes at national level.</P>
        <P>As part of a wider system of structural reform, my Department is establishing a network of ten regional offices, including one in Tallaght. This network of offices will help to identify education issues arising at local level, particularly gaps and overlap in social inclusion provision, and provide regular reports to my Department. This local presence will help my Department to continue to target resources at those most at risk of educational disadvantage in Tallaght and other similar areas. My priority as Minister for Education and Science will be to continue targeting resources at those areas and people most in need.</P>

	<P>There are five children detention schools under the aegis of my Department which provide residential care, education and rehabilitation for children, generally up to age 16, who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts. The operational capacity of the five schools is 114 of which there are 15 places for girls and 99 for boys. Officials from my Department have confirmed that on Friday, 22 <Col N="677"/>October 2004, a total of 81 of the 114 beds were occupied.</P>
        <P>St. Joseph&rsquo;s school, unlike the other four schools, caters for both offending children referred by the courts and non-offending children on placement from various health boards across the country in accordance with the Health Acts.</P>
        <P>Of the 81 occupied beds in the schools on 22 October 2002, 18 were occupied in St. Joseph&rsquo;s school by children pursuant to the Health Acts. The remaining 63 beds were occupied by children detained on foot of court orders. Alternative placements are being sought for nine of these children, of which alternatives have been secured for two of the cases as of Friday, 22 October 2004.</P>
        <P>The Special Residential Services Board was established pursuant to the Children Act 2001. Its function is to provide policy advice to my Department and to the Department of Health and Children on the remand and detention of children and to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made. The mission statement of the board is that detention is a measure of last resort. The board liaises with the courts and, advises on request, with regard to suitable bed placements or alternate child care options depending on the case circumstances.</P>
        <P>Since April 2004, all requests for beds in the children detention schools from the courts are channelled centrally via the Special Residential Services Board. There is on-going co-ordination by this board with the various agencies, including my Department, in order to provide for alternate placements including the necessary child care plans and services most appropriate to meet the needs of the individual child.</P>

        <Quest>the course which is open to parents of children with disabilities and chronic health problems to seek appropriate educational provision for their children without having to resort to litigation against the State; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an <Col N="688"/>integrated basis in ordinary schools with special back-up supports.</P>
        <P>The nature and level of the special educational response provided is largely based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. The National Educational Psychological Service, which was established in 1999, employs qualified educational psychologists to provide the assessment service.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with special needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of special resource teachers and/or special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 108 special schools in the country at present. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and other staffing supports. For example, each class catering for a maximum of six children with autism or children with severe/profound general learning disability will have a staffing of at least one teacher and two special needs assistants. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>Where placement in a special school is not considered necessary, children with special needs can attend special classes attached to ordinary main<Col N="689"/>stream schools. Each special class is dedicated to a particular disability group. All special classes enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers. A total of approximately 654 special classes are in place in the primary system at present. While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure if appropriate.</P>
        <P>Since 1998, the following dedicated resources have been deployed to support children with special needs in the primary system: more than 2,600 resource teachers, up from 104 in 1998; more than 1,500 learning support teachers, up from 1,302 in 1998; more than 1,000 teachers in special schools; more than 600 teachers in special classes; more than 5,000 special needs assistants, up from 300 in 1998; more than &euro;30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; more than &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials; up from &euro;0.8million in 1998.</P>
        <P>To appreciate the scale of improvement in the provision of resources to primary schools for special needs, it is worth reflecting on the fact that, at approximately 10,700, the number of adults providing services to children with special educational needs in primary schools today equates to more than half of the 21,100 primary teaching force in 1998.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42 day limit.</P>
        <P>Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil. The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The welfare board has indicated that it will treat children for whom an appeal under section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance.</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 sets out the rights and entitlements of children with special needs to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. In addition, the national council for special education, which will have a local area presence, <Col N="690"/>will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in the establishment of the national council and 70 special education needs organisers, SENOs, have recently been recruited. The SENOs will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents as well as processing individual applications for resources for special educational needs. It is anticipated that the council and the SENOs will become operational shortly.</P>

	<P>Casement Aerodrome, which is the only secure military aerodrome in the State, has been operated by the <Col N="691"/>Defence Forces since the foundation of the State. It provides facilities for military aircraft training and operations, including fishery protection patrols, ministerial air transport, Garda air support, etc.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for planning and development in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome currently rests with the planning department of South Dublin County Council and all planning decisions are made by that authority. The practice down the years has been for the local planning authority to consult the Department of Defence in respect of planning applications for proposed developments which may affect Casement Aerodrome.</P>
        <P>My Department commissioned a review of its air safety policy at Casement Aerodrome in June 1999. The review was carried out by Sir Frederick Snow and Partners Limited, and following extensive consideration of their report, a formal statement of the Department&rsquo;s revised policy was notified to South Dublin County Council on 26 June 2000. The current safety policy reflects best international practice in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations and provides for military training in the area.</P>
        <P>The position is that weekly planning lists as issued by the planning authority of South Dublin County Council are examined in my Department. Where any such application may conflict with my Department&rsquo;s air safety policy or affect the safety and operation of Casement Aerodrome, my Department&rsquo;s observations and/or objections, as appropriate, are conveyed to the council.</P>
        <P>The detailed information in relation to applications requested by the Deputy is not readily available and the compilation of such information would require a disproportionate allocation of staff resources.

        <Quest>the five measurable performance indicators which he regards as target of greatest priority within his Department; the way in which this measure has changed in each year since 1997; his views on whether confining priorities to five indicators gives too partial a picture of Departmental priorities; and if he will indicate the movement over the period 1997 to 2004 of other primary indicators of performance.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In the period 1997-2001 my Department had four strategic objectives and a number of associated strategies and performance indicators which were set out in successive strategy statements. A fifth objective, dealing with emergency planning, was added in 2001. Successive annual reports detail the progress made in respect of each of the objec<Col N="692"/>tives in terms of the associated strategies and performance indicators.</P>
        <P>The strategic objectives have been essentially the same since 1997, except in emergency planning, and are currently set out in the Department of Defence strategy statement for 2003-05. The objectives are to contribute to the security of the State principally against the threat of armed aggression and thus contribute to political and economic well being &mdash; the security objective; to promote the co-ordination of emergency planning functions across all Departments and agencies and to oversee the emergency planning process in general &mdash; the emergency planning objective; to facilitate through the local authorities Civil Defence responses for emergency relief and support to ensure the operation of vital services and the maintenance of public life and to provide all other supports as directed by Government &mdash; the Civil Defence objective; to continue the modernisation of the Defence Forces by implementing the White Paper on Defence and related modernisation initiatives &mdash; the White Paper objective; and to provide the Minister for Defence with the best policy advice and support on the management of defence &mdash; the policy advice and support objective.</P>
        <P>Given that these objectives closely follow the Defence commitments made in the programme for Government, each of the objectives is important, as are all of the related strategies and performance indicators. It would be invidious to try to isolate any five or more as of greater priority than the others.</P>

	<P>Air quality assessment is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and air quality management a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data. The EPA&rsquo;s air quality monitoring annual report 2002, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, contains details of all air quality monitoring stations operated by the local authorities and the EPA, including those in County Kildare. Monitoring of air pollution is also undertaken as a condition of some integrated pollution control licences issued by the agency. Information on all aspects of IPC licences is available from the EPA.</P>
        <P>The extent to which adequate air pollution monitoring exists throughout the country and <Col N="693"/>whether the technology involved is sufficiently modern and adequate to meet requirements, are matters for the relevant local authorities, and the EPA at a national level under Article 4 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999. The Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 specify the reference methods for the sampling, analysis and measurement of concentrations of air pollutants.</P>
        <P>The reporting and making available of information on ambient concentrations of pollutants within the scope of the 2002 regulations is the responsibility of the EPA. In addition to its annual monitoring report for 2002, the agency&rsquo;s website, <i>www.epa.ie/OurEnvironment/Air</i>, provides the public with real-time information, updated on an hourly basis, on air quality from a number of monitoring points around the country.</P>

	<P>Revenue generated by Repak from membership fees is primarily a matter for Repak and its members. I have no function in this matter and as such it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are obliged to collect or arrange for the collection of household waste within their functional areas. However, this obligation does not apply in certain circumstances, including where an adequate waste collection ser<Col N="694"/>vice is otherwise available. In those areas where a local authority collection service is in place, the determination of charges for the service is a matter for the local authority itself. In areas where the local authority is not involved in the collection service, the determination of charges is a matter for the private collectors concerned. Based on returns received from local authorities in respect of their 2004 adopted budgets, income from domestic refuse charges applied by local authorities themselves is estimated to amount to &euro;113 million in 2004.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The amount of development contributions collected in 2003 is currently being compiled and will be available shortly. In addition to any increase in the contribution rate charged by local authorities, the total income generated reflects the significant rise in construction activity during this period, for example, housing output increased from 38,842 in 1997 to 57,695 in 2002.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have estimates of any changes in the amount accruing to local authorities arising from the adoption in March 2004 of the new regime, due to the lead-in time between the grant of planning permission for a development and the start of construction. It should be noted that, in a number of cases, the local elected members who adopted the development contribution scheme introduced lower charges than those applying under the previous system. It is likely that the full impact of new development contribution schemes will not be measurable until 2006-07.</P>

	<P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a body established by statute under the Planning and Development Act 2000 which operates completely independently in performing its functions. Members are appointed on the basis of nominations from 37 bodies. An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to make an independent determination of appeals on planning authorities&rsquo; decisions. In dealing with an appeal, the board must consider all submissions on the file, together with the inspector&rsquo;s report and recommendation. The board reaches its own conclusion in each case, in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. The board must also have regard to ministerial policy and guidelines, including the recently published draft sustainable rural housing guidelines.</P>

	<P>Landlords are obliged to register their tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and have until 1 December 2004 to register tenancies in existence at 1 September 2004. The board has responsibility for pursuing compliance with the registration requirement. A wide range of action to promote registration is being undertaken including information, publicity and direct contact with landlords. Unregistered accommodation will also come to attention where tenants refer disputes to the board. A double fee will apply to late registrations and conviction for an offence relating to registration requirements, will carry a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or imprisonment <Col N="699"/>for a term not exceeding six months or both, along with a daily fine, of up to &euro;250 for continuing non-compliance.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 prescribes various obligations of landlords and tenants, including an obligation on landlords to enforce tenants&rsquo; obligations where a person, such as a neighbour, would be adversely affected by a failure to do so. Complaints regarding failure to comply with obligations can be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board under provisions of the Act to be commenced shortly. Third parties affected will have a right to refer a complaint against a landlord who has failed to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligations. The board can direct the landlord to ensure that the tenants comply with their obligations and if necessary, enforce compliance through the courts.</P>
        <P>Complaints relating to the standard or condition of particular properties can be made to the relevant local authority, Dublin City Council in the case of the street in question. Local authorities are responsible for enforcing the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, including inspection of premises, notifying landlords of necessary improvements and, where appropriate, instituting court proceedings. The regulations prescribe minimum physical standards of private rented accommodation, including maintenance of dwellings in good repair, and require common areas, yards, forecourts and items such as walls and fences to be kept in good repair and clean condition. Conviction for an offence in relation to accommodation standards carries a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and up to &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the steps which have been taken to prevent persons, political parties, third parties, any other local authority or the Office of the Revenue Commissioners from deleting names from the register of electors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the interests of the democratic process that the register of electors details as accurately as possible those persons who are entitled to vote at elections. Moreover, additions to and deletions from the register should be made in an open and fully transparent manner. Under electoral law, any person may claim to have a correction made to the draft register of electors following publication on 1 November. The claim must be made to the registration authority by 25 November and it may include, in particular, a claim to have the name of a person added or deleted. Such claims are ruled on, in public, by the appropriate county registrar and interested parties must be given notice of the time and location of the proposed hearing. An appeal may be made in the Circuit Court in relation to a decision of a county registrar.</P><Col N="700"/>
        <P>In regard to removing electors from the register in the course of its preparation, authorities are required under a ministerial instruction issued under section 18 of the Electoral Act 1992 to send a notice to a person, whose name it is proposed to omit from the draft register, indicating that they have failed to establish that the person is still resident at the address and, unless evidence to the contrary is provided within ten days, his or her name will be removed.</P>
        <P>After the final register comes into force, a person&rsquo;s name can only be removed if they have applied successfully for entry on the supplement to the register as a result of a change of residence to a new constituency or local electoral area. In such cases, the person&rsquo;s name on the register in respect of his or her previous address is deleted and he or she are registered at their new address.</P>

        <Quest>the five measurable performance indicators which he regards as target of greatest priority within his Department; the way in which this measure has changed in each year since 1997; his views on whether confining priorities to five indicators gives too partial a picture of departmental priorities; and if he will indicate the movement over the period 1997 to 2004 of other primary indicators of performance.</Quest>

My Department is currently preparing a new statement of strategy which will cover the period 2005-07. Progress in implementing the statement of strategy is set out annually in the Department&rsquo;s annual report. Copies of the annual reports for 1998 to 2002 are available in the Oireachtas Library. The annual report for 2003 will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>The administration of the shared ownership scheme is a matter for individual local authorities. Authorities must assess each application under the scheme on its merits and must have regard,<i> inter alia</i>, to the ability of applicants to manage the mortgage and rental commitments arising from a shared ownership transaction. It should normally be possible for this criterion to be satisfied by a range of different employment tenures.</P>
