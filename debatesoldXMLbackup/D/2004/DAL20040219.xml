   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the backlog of post which is building up in the Tuam post office area in County Galway where more than 30,000 letters have not been delivered, to request the management of An Post to confirm in writing if it has purchased or intends to purchase alternative sorting accommodation in Tuam to replace an existing building which has long outlived its usefulness and could possibly be in breach of health and safety regulations and to request An Post to make an immediate and urgent arrangement to have all backlog post delivered within the next few days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance and concern, namely, the cancellation of elective surgery on an ongoing basis at Cavan General Hospital, which is a direct consequence of the fact that Monaghan General Hospital has been off call since 2 July 2002 and the possibility of placing Monaghan General Hospital back on call to alleviate the situation at Cavan General Hospital and thus enable both hospitals to become productive and to play a complementary role in the provision of comprehensive health services in the Cavan-Monaghan area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment explain to the House how a company, CG Services in Ballycurreen industrial estate in Cork, which services the pharmaceutical industry in the Cork region, could reach a <Col N="758"/>situation where it will be liquidated with the loss of 120 jobs and the impact this announcement will have on the industrial policy of the region, given the recent F&Aacute;S survey which shows that jobs growth for 2004 is likely to be the slowest since 1992 and that the public sector is producing more jobs than the private sector.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order Of" RHead="Business">
   <Title>Order Of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 13<i>b</i>, Finance Bill 2004 &mdash; Financial Resolutions; No. 13<i>c</i>, motion re sittings and business of the D&aacute;il; No. 1, Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence ) (Amendment) Bill 2003 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Second Stage; and No. 2, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 7 p.m. and that Nos. 13<i>b</i> and 13<i>c</i> shall be decided without debate and, in the case of No. 13<i>b</i>, Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 to 23, inclusive, shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13<i>b</i> and 13<i>c </i>without debate agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards No. 13<i>c</i>, in view of the number of times that both the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach referred in the House to the publication of appropriate findings from the Nally report, which dealt with the Omagh bombing, will the Taoiseach be here tomorrow for that debate? I know he is in Omagh today. As the matter will be discussed in the House tomorrow, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to make a statement here about whether he intends to meet the families or to give them a copy of an appropriate edited version of the Nally report?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I am advised the Taoiseach will not be in Dublin tomorrow. He will, therefore, not be here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the motion on Friday sittings, this type of sanitised sitting with no Order of Business, no parliamentary questions, no Adjournment debate and no possibility of a vote or challenge is not a sitting of the House because the Government cannot be called to account. That is the function of the House. These types of sittings are a farce and they should be recognised as such by the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Stagg. We call for real D&aacute;il reform every week. Will such reform <Col N="759"/>be introduced before 11 June? Will the Government live up to its promises on D&aacute;il reform or will we&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about Friday sittings and this is essential when talking about D&aacute;il reform. We have asked for real Friday sittings and not these bogus ones.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards No. 13<i>b</i>, a different element in the proposition, the Financial Resolutions before us cover a wide range of areas. While I have noted that traditionally these go through without debate, nevertheless they cover a raft of measures under the taxation code. That they are taken without debate is inappropriate, particularly in the number of instances I have gone through them in detail. I object to the fact that they are being taken without debate, although I understand the technical requirement that they must be passed before the Finance Bill is addressed in committee. Nevertheless, I hope it is noted that this is an inappropriate way to deal with matters that have a significant impact on the taxation code and on some of the controversial reliefs that operate under same.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stagg has already spoken on behalf of the Labour Party. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13<i>b</i> and 13<i>c</i> without debate agreed to?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, two motions are being taken together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>When a question is being put, we do not hear a point of order.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13<i>b</i> and 13<i>c</i> be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>May I raise my point of order now? There have been objections before to the taking of two separate and disconnected items together in one motion. Completely different cases need to be made in respect of Nos. 13<i>b</i> and 13<i>c</i>. There is no connection. By putting them together, the Ceann Comhairle did not allow separate arguments to be made on these matters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair did not put them together. There was one proposal before the House and one Member from each party was entitled to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a procedural point, will the Ceann Comhairle, as Chair, request the Government Whip that, where entirely separate <Col N="760"/>issues are before the House, each should be heard separately?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a matter for the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>To roll together such matters is an abuse and limits the rights of Members to have meaningful debate on issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. I call Deputy Kenny.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>For whom is this a matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past items have always been grouped.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle should not mind the prompt sheet and should answer the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A proposal grouping one or more items of business in one proposal is in order as the proposal arrangements to be followed are more or less the same for all items to be taken without debate. The items themselves are voted on separately when put to the House after the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that is the case. However, what is the answer to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s point of order?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair had one proposal to put to the House at that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They were separate issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that, and the Ceann Comhairle did so in accordance with Standing Orders. It is disposed of. Deputy Howlin has raised a procedural point about taking two separate and different matters in the one motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That has always been the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not always the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have pointed out, the grouping of one or more items in one proposal has been a long tradition for as long as I can remember in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been as long as the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, has been Government Chief Whip.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be put to the House separately to be voted on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we ask the T&aacute;naiste if it is not a reasonable point that the House should have the opportunity to hear two entirely separate, independent and different matters <Col N="761"/>separately? Is that not a reasonable way to proceed with these matters in the future?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal we put was to take these items without debate. Essentially they are both technical. One is to refer the financial resolutions to a committee where they will be fully discussed and the other is the business for tomorrow. To avoid reading out a very long motion that outlines the agenda for tomorrow, it is being done in this way. We are dealing with a technicality and we are asking that this be done without debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice that the Ceann Comhairle referred back to as far as he could remember. I can remember a little further back and recall such items being voted on separately on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct. They will be put to the House separately and, if necessary, voted on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>However this is being done without debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste consider it appropriate that Government contracts of a multi-million euro nature are awarded when politically appointed advisers are allowed sit on the determining body? Is the T&aacute;naiste happy with that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Public money is involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter which was dealt with in the House yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>A Bill was promised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have another matter which is in order about which the T&aacute;naiste spoke on the radio yesterday. I note from this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that the Elan corporation is to launch a new multifunctional drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that IDA Ireland discusses with the Elan corporation the fulfilment of a commitment to provide 300 jobs in Macroom, County Cork?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the T&aacute;naiste in her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are two important questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that they are two important questions, which is why they should be dealt with in the correct way.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="762"/>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us hear the answers now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should answer the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste recall the commitment given by the former Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, when the enabling legislation to introduce electronic voting was put through the Seanad that it would not be implemented without the support of the parties in Opposition, whichever ones they were at the time? Is that still the position of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. We had a long debate on this matter on Tuesday and Wednesday. It was also raised and allowed on the Order of Business for the past two days and the matter was dealt with.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Some Government Members should also be concerned about this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste campaigned on the basis of not having a single party Government. I am beginning to think we have such a Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have. Does the T&aacute;naiste support the enactment of the promised legislation on this matter prior to the local and European elections?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a valid question that needs to be answered now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of who supports legislation can be debated when the legislation comes before the House. It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about the debate that was promised at the time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the intention of the Government, of which Deputy Harney is T&aacute;naiste, to enact this legislation before the European and local elections?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question has already been dealt with this week and answered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Outside the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="763"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has come a long way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gormley.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has gone with the mother party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a separate matter of legislation. I remind the T&aacute;naiste of a Bill she introduced entitled the National Lottery (Amendment) Bill 1988. I have a number of quotes stressing her opposition to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Quotes are not necessary. Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to give the tenor of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows he is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not quote what she said. However, the House can take my word for it that the T&aacute;naiste was in high indignation about slush funds and the lottery funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government introduce amending legislation to change the arrangement to have independent trustees disperse the dormant accounts fund?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was dealt with yesterday as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the Bill. It did not pass because the Labour Party voted with the minority Government of the day and, unfortunately, the Bill was rejected.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a bad Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot have it every way. The dormant accounts legislation will be published this year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gormley.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This week saw the emergence of the alternative Government and the decline of the current one. The issue that brought it to a head was electronic voting. Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that there is no way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Some would be excluded.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree there is no way to get this legislation passed before 11 June?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Hogan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is on promised legislation. When will this legislation come before the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question was dealt with yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the answer?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Shortly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Are Ministers often delayed because they know something?</P>

	<P>That is why he is in Malaysia.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is present and not on another golden Thursday run around the country with job announcements. What is the status of the transposition of the 5th EU motor insurance directive? When will it be debated in the House? Does the T&aacute;naiste have any plans to amend the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act to ensure greater transparency of the costs and premia of insurance companies and brokers arising from a Competition Authority report yesterday?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am flattered to think the boardrooms of America would meet to help my election campaign and approve projects.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>They got the T&aacute;naiste three seats.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear Deputy Hogan talk about competition because according to the newspaper last Sunday, he wanted me to close down the independent inquiry by the Competition Authority into bank charges.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should deal with the question of legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should deal with the question she was asked.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>If the fifth motor directive is agreed during the Irish Presidency it will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the T&aacute;naiste doing about it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste about the promised electoral (amendment) Bill to deal with electronic voting. Has the Government considered the heads of the Bill? If not, when <Col N="765"/>does she expect it to do so? Can she give an approximate date for the publication of the Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a short but important technical Bill, the immediate purpose of which is to ensure that Judge Mahon as chairperson of the tribunal to inquire into certain planning matters and payments, previously chaired by Mr. Justice Flood, can make orders regarding applications for costs incurred during the tenure of the previous chairperson. The issue became apparent following the resignation, in June 2003, of Mr. Justice Flood as chairperson of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>More specifically, the issue arises with regard to the determination of costs concerned with certain modules dealt with in the already published interim reports of the Flood tribunal. These modules were dealt with at a time when Mr. Justice Flood was the sole member of that tribunal and the reports were accordingly prepared by him. The determination of costs had not been made at the time of Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s resignation.</P>
    <P>A key provision in the Bill, accordingly, is section 2. It provides by way of amendment of section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act of 1979, for the insertion of a new subsection 1A under which the sole member of a tribunal, or the chairperson, if there is more than one member, may make an order on any costs that were incurred before his or her appointment and which have not already been determined. In exercising this power, the sole member or chairperson must have regard to any report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment. The Bill makes clear that the new provisions will apply to tribunals appointed and costs incurred before or after the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate in the Seanad on 9 December last, where the Bill passed all Stages, some concerns were expressed that the Bill, in making provision to permit a new chairperson of a tribunal to make orders regarding costs that were incurred before his or her appointment and which were not already determined by a previous chairperson, was somehow retrospective in effect.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, and the Attorney General agrees, that such concerns are justified. The new chairperson is permitted only to make orders on costs which were incurred before his or her appointment and which have not already been determined. If in fact the previous chairperson had made determinations on costs, and the new chairperson sought to amend or reconsider such determinations, then it could legitimately be argued that there was retrospective action involved. Moreover, the Bill makes clear that in making a determination on costs, the new chairperson is required to have regard to any report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment. In <Col N="780"/>this way there can be no doubt but that the chairperson is acting within certain prescribed parameters.</P>
    <P>Another key provision of the Bill is contained in section 3. It provides an express power for a tribunal to seek the direction of the High Court relating to the performance of the functions of the tribunal, including costs. This provision mirrors similar provisions provided for inspectors appointed under the Companies Act 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also provides that the High Court may hear an application otherwise than in public, if satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because of the subject matter on which the direction is sought, the risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings, or any other matter relevant to the nature of the evidence to be given at the hearing of the application.</P>
    <P>The High Court is also asked to give such priority as it reasonably can to the disposal of the proceedings in the court concerning an application made to it from a tribunal and the court rules committee is empowered to make rules to facilitate giving effect to this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill also provides an express power to the chairperson to direct other members of the tribunal, where there is more than one member, to sit as separate divisions and to determine the conditions that will apply, including the preparation of reports.</P>
    <P>There is, it is fair to say, fairly widespread dissatisfaction on all sides, including the Government, with regard to the costs associated with tribunals. These have become quite significant. Many Deputies would wish that the Government was bringing forward today a more comprehensive Bill regarding the operation of tribunals, particularly in regard to legal costs. We are conscious that changes are needed in the organisation and administration of tribunals in an effort to reduce the levels of legal costs associated with tribunals. To that end, I mention two initiatives currently under way.</P>
    <P>Following approval by the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published in July 2003, the Commissions of Investigation Bill, which, it is hoped, can provide for an alternative, more timely and cost-effective mechanism for investigations into matters giving rise to significant public concern. This will not be a single or permanent body but it is planned that commissions may be established as required and that more than one may sit simultaneously.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the legislation to establish commissions of investigation will not amend or alter any of the legislation relating to tribunals, nor will it alter in any way the powers available to tribunals currently under way or any other inquiry or investigation mechanism already available. It is envisaged that commissions will, instead, provide a new and alternative mechanism. In certain instances, they will be a precursor to a tribunal of inquiry. Commissions will be required to establish the factual position. <Col N="781"/>A commission may be followed by a tribunal where it is unable to establish clear facts.</P>
    <P>In those situations, the evidence collected by a commission will be available to the tribunal, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with tribunals. In reducing the time and cost involved, while ensuring fair procedures and respect for confidentiality, the proposed commissions of investigation will add significantly to the mechanisms and instruments available for public investigations. It is hoped that further progress will be made towards the enactment of this Bill in the present session.</P>
    <P>I also direct the attention of Deputies to the work of the Law Reform Commission, which has been examining all issues concerning tribunals. The commission issued a lengthy consultation paper in March 2003, which traced the history of public inquiries in general, dealt with the legal and constitutional issues which have arisen, the type of proceedings involved and the issue of costs. The consultation report made a number of recommendations with regard to the totality of issues involved with tribunals. It is expected that the final report of the commission should be available later this year. It will surely provide an important input into how public inquiries might be conducted in the future. However, the Bill we are considering today, though critical, is primarily concerned with the issue of determination of costs, with particular reference to an existing tribunal.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party will not oppose this Bill. It is eight months since Mr. Justice Flood retired, and we welcome the fact that it has come to the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill can essentially be described as a technical Bill. It is worth reminding the House of the circumstances which gave rise to the need for certain aspects covered in it. In June 2001, Mr. Justice Flood requested extra judges but only in March 2002 was that request acceded to. On 16 June 2002, Mr. Justice Flood announced his decision to step down as chairman but said he would remain on as an ordinary member thereby enabling him to determine the question of costs. However, in late June 2003 he announced his decision to resign completely. I understand that up to a certain point in time he was willing to remain on and determine costs but that following a meeting with the Attorney General he decided to resign fully.</P>
    <P>This legislation will allow Judge Mahon to adjudicate on the costs issue arising from the first five years of the tribunal. It is necessary. I agree that without the legislation, Judge Mahon&rsquo;s decisions could be open to legal challenge. Currently, the legal costs submitted lie between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million. Mr. Ray Burke&rsquo;s legal team has submitted a bill of approximately &euro;10.5 million. I hope that when this legislation is enacted and Judge Mahon decides on the costs issue, he will take a firm stance with those people <Col N="782"/>who obstructed and did not co-operate with the work of the tribunal. I will be delighted if he takes a firm, frank line with those individuals. This would send out a necessary and meaningful message.</P>
    <P>Any legislation represents a potential opportunity to disrupt and delay the work of the tribunal. A well drafted provision would deter potential challenges. Section 2 of this Bill will be heavily scrutinised by the legal teams of particular individuals.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State confirm if the Attorney General was personally involved in the drafting of this legislation? Will he assure us that he is convinced of the strength of this provision? This is an important matter and the legislation needs to be watertight. I hope the Minister of State will provide us with these assurances when he concludes the debate.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill allows the tribunal to seek direction from the High Court in matters relating to its function and costs. The purpose of including this safeguard in the legislation is to reinforce the finding of Judge Mahon, which I support. The second part of section 3 allows tribunals to sit in divisions. It gives the Mahon tribunal potential to sit in three distinct parallel units. In theory this could mean the work of the tribunal will be three times faster, but it may be too optimistic to say that. Modules in these tribunals are intertwined and, in many cases, the same characters play a leading role in each module. I am not convinced this measure will result in any great breakthrough at the tribunal, but I hope I am wrong about this. Uncovering the truth can be a slow process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to what may be more pertinent legislation in terms of the working of tribunals and the history of tribunals in this country, namely, the Commissions of Investigation Bill. As I understand it, under this legislation new inquiries would be conducted in private and a public hearing would only be held if this type of inquiry did not succeed. I welcome the fact that this measure is due to come forward and I urge that it be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has tabled four Committee Stage amendments. We do not oppose this Stage of the Bill and recommend its passage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party will not oppose the Bill either. It is a fairly straightforward and short Bill which has arisen from the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood who dealt with the planning tribunal. If he had been treated in a proper fashion, and if his concerns had been given due consideration, the Bill before us may not have been required.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Justice Flood requested extra resources and that other judges be appointed, a deaf ear was turned towards him and no response came from Government. In tendering his resignation he offered to stay on to deal with the matter of costs which is a legally tricky aspect at the heart of this legislation. If Mr. Justice Flood <Col N="783"/>had been requested to remain in place this legislation would not have been required. However, the Government did not make this request and, in fact, created a limbo situation at that time through Government spin.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach misled the House in the manner in which he presented the case. He gave the impression that he had just heard about it when, in fact, he had the letter from Mr. Justice Flood for over a month before he announced it in the House. He informed the House that he had not properly considered the issues because he had just received the note, this, however, was not the case, as he already knew all about it. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, declined to consider the offer of Mr. Justice Flood to stay on.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this has taken place is most strange. It is too much of a coincidence when we observe that Ms Justice Laffoy also expressed severe reservations about the way in which the Government handled the problems which she was facing and that she also received no co-operation. She went as far as saying that there was deliberate obstruction.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach constantly informs us that he was the man who began the process of a number of these inquiries. However, the Government appears to be extremely reluctant to co-operate enthusiastically with any of the inquiries. It appears to be more intent on putting obstacles in the way of inquiries conducting their business and putting out a spin to the effect that they will continue for many years. The Taoiseach used a figure of 15 years at one time in regard to the Flood tribunal and then a figure of 30 years.</P>
    <P>Any citizen listening to that spin would remark on the terrible waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. The beef tribunal concluded with nobody being held accountable; nobody went to prison. This led to frustration and to people calling for an end to the tribunal system. However, the tribunals, are doing much good work. The context in which the tribunals were established reflected a lack of accountability and transparency in the conduct of public administration. The point should be reached where tribunals will no longer be necessary. Although they were occasionally a thing of the past, the plethora of tribunals at present reflect a diminution in public standards and a lack of accountability by the organs and institutions of State. We have all failed in that respect. It behoves us to ensure that everybody gets their house in order and that we, as legislators, construct a proper framework to govern the way in which we do our business. This will assist the various servants of the State in how they conduct their business and ensure the private sector is sufficiently monitored and scrutinised that it does not become a law unto itself or operate in an illegal or rogue fashion.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to ensure that we put in place structures and amendments to allow the Mahon tribunal, formerly the Flood tribunal, to <Col N="784"/>conduct its work properly and that it will not be delayed again by a legal challenge. I hope that what we put in place regarding the manner in which costs are prescribed and adjudicated will be sufficient. I think it will be, even though it means the new chairman will operate in a retrospective fashion.</P>
    <P>It is important that this matter be rectified by means of a statutory amendment. It is also important that the chairman is provided with a backup allowing him to seek direction from the High Court on the performance and functions of the tribunal, including the matter of costs. I hope both of these measures will have the desired effect in allowing the allocation and determination of costs.</P>
    <P>Large sums of money have already been mentioned. The former Minister, Mr. Burke, is allegedly seeking in the region of &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million in legal costs. He wants the taxpayer to foot his bill when there are serious findings in regard to his activities. The matter is an extremely delicate one and it must be got right, otherwise the taxpayer will foot the bill in all of these cases.</P>
    <P>The third matter dealt with in the Bill is the question of the tribunal sitting in separate divisions. I welcome the appointment of the two other judges, Judge Mary Faherty and Judge Gerald Keys, which will make the Mahon tribunal a three-person one. I hope this will expedite the business of the tribunal so modules do not have to be dealt with by a single member or the tribunal as a whole, but that its business can be dealt with in a modular fashion. We are forever talking about the question of costs and the timescale that will be required.</P>
    <P>A motion was debated in the House in July 2003 on the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. This sought approval for Judge Mahon, Judge Faherty and Judge Keys to be appointed as new members of the tribunal. There had been a number of exchanges on the issue of sitting in parallel in separate divisions that would be established to expedite the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Labour Party wrote to the Taoiseach on the possibility of tribunal members sitting in parallel. It reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P LI="1">I write in reference to the exchanges between us during the D&aacute;il debate last Thursday on the Planning Tribunal. I had expressed regret at the ruling out of order of my proposal seeking to enable the Planning Tribunal members to sit in parallel, where feasible and appropriate. [While it could have been done at that time, the Government obviously knew best.]</P>
    <P LI="0">The Minister, Deputy Cullen, intervened to say: &ldquo;That is a matter for the judges. It is not for us to dictate how they order their business.&rdquo; We now know it was not. And you [the Taoiseach] said:-</P><Col N="785"/>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;We are not changing any of the terms of reference. If we tried to change the terms of reference we would have another difficulty. There is no reason to do so. I hope they do sit in parallel for some of the modules. I agree with the Deputy, but they can do that under the present terms of reference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P LI="1">If that is the case, why is this Bill being introduced? I have quoted what the Taoiseach said when the appointment of the Mahon tribunal members was being dealt with.</P>
    <P LI="1">The leader of the Labour Party replied:</P>
    <P LI="2">I merely raised the point for discussion because when many people saw three extra judges being appointed to the tribunal they assumed it was going to speed up. They also assumed that different modules could proceed in parallel and that the work would be done simultaneously but they have been surprised to find that is not the case.</P>
    <P LI="1">Even though there were three judges, there was no provision to expedite the work.</P>
    <P LI="1">The letter continues with a quote from the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who intervened at a later stage in the proceedings:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;... I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on one point. I shared his misapprehension that when three judges were assigned to the work of this tribunal of inquiry, it might be possible for them to sit separately and determine issues in a separate way. Were that done, I have no doubt that it would expedite the work of the tribunal. Again, as was made clear in the course of this debate, that is a matter for the tribunal itself to determine. I welcome Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s stating of the fact in the House that he would like to see that happen. If it does assist in expediting the work of the tribunal in dealing with more of these modules, then all the better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P LI="2">The purpose of this letter is to seek explicit clarification in relation to the issue, which is not I believe contentious, politically or otherwise.</P>
    <P LI="2">Are you advised that it is possible under the present legislation and terms of reference for the tribunal to sub-divide, so that individual members could be allocated separate modules to be inquired into and reported upon by them sitting alone? Could there be two or more divisions of the tribunal sitting, in relation to separate matters, at the same time?</P>
    <P LI="2">Clearly, my own belief that such a procedure is not at present permissible is not shared by you or your colleagues in Government. But, on checking the record of the second stage debate on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002, it seems to me that the then Minister for <Col N="786"/>Justice, John O&rsquo;Donoghue, interpreted his legislation in much the same way I do. Has there been a change in the advice offered between then and yesterday?</P>
    <P LI="2">Section 4 of the 2002 Act amended s. 2 of the 1979 Act and inserted a provision to the effect that, subject to rules governing the awarding of costs, &ldquo;a decision or determination of a tribunal consisting of more than one member may be that of a majority of its members and, in the case of an equal division among its members as to the decision or determination to be made, the decision or determination shall be that of the chairperson of the tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P LI="2">The Minister said (22nd March, 2002, col. 5): -</P>
    <P LI="3">&ldquo;The phrase &rsquo;may be that of a majority of its members&rsquo; rather than &rsquo;shall be&rsquo; is to take account of the possibility that decisions and determinations may be unanimous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P LI="2">Later (at col. 8), he repeats that: -</P>
    <P LI="3">&ldquo;I have already outlined, section 4 provides that a decision of a tribunal consisting of more than one member is to be that of a majority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P LI="2">And at cols. 6 and 7 the Minister considered a situation where -</P>
    <P LI="3">&ldquo;the original tribunal member has left the tribunal and that person was the sole member when particular evidence was heard, while the additional member(s) were not members or reserve members at that time. The tribunal might, in those circumstances, conclude that it would unduly prejudice a person&rsquo;s legal rights were it to make findings on evidence it did not hear and to which it has access, perhaps, only in the form of transcripts... &rdquo;</P>
    <P LI="2">Two conclusions seem apparent from the framework of that Act and the Minister&rsquo;s common sense explanation of its workings. First the decision of a tribunal is that of the majority of its members. Second, a member should not contribute to decision-making on an issue in relation to which that member has not heard the evidence. That being so, it seems to me to follow that it is not at present possible for a single member sitting alone to receive the evidence and decide the issues arising in respect of a discrete module. The member cannot decide it alone because that member is not a majority of the membership of the tribunal. Yet the other members cannot contribute to the decision-making because they have not heard the relevant evidence.</P>
    <P LI="2">You will appreciate that members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad have a legitimate interest in arriving at a clear, common and consistent <Col N="787"/>view on this question. We are all of us concerned to ensure the efficient and economical workings of the tribunal and this issue is relevant in deciding whether there is any need for either legislative change or future amendment to the governing terms of reference.</P>
    <P LI="2">Thank you for any light you can shed on this matter.</P>
    <P LI="3">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P LI="3">Pat Rabbitte T.D.</P>
    <P LI="3">Leader of the Labour Party</P>
    <P FLI="0">This letter was dispatched to the Taoiseach on 10 July 2003. It sought guidance in a matter on which there was a difference of opinion in the D&aacute;il some days earlier. The Taoiseach replied by letter on 21 July 2003 stating:</P>
    <P LI="1">Dear Deputy Rabbitte,</P>
    <P LI="1">Thank you for your letter of 10 July 2003.</P>
    <P LI="1">I am glad that you recognise that the objective of ensuring that members of the Tribunal may sit and hear different modules concurrently is one that is shared by all sides of the House. Our common desire to achieve an efficient and working inquiry system &mdash; which reduces the exposure of the State to legal costs &mdash; is something that should inspire political cooperation, in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>
    <P LI="1">The public are, rightly, concerned at the level of costs incurred in connection with various tribunals. Proposals to reduce the costs of conducting inquiries are contained in the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003. [I wish we had that Bill before us now]. However, that Bill does not, of itself, address the problems of costs and of duration that affect the operations of current tribunals. Thus further legislative changes require consideration.</P>
    <P LI="1">It is correct that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 2002 contains provisions dealing with tribunals of more than one member. As you know this effect of the legislation of 2002 was set out by the then Minister for Justice, Mr John O&rsquo;Donoghue TD in his speech in the D&aacute;il at the Second Stage of the debate on what was then the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill 2002. But there is other legislation that also needs to be considered in relation to the operations of tribunals. My advice is that our existing legislative code does not prevent parallel sittings.</P>
    <P LI="1">As you are aware, in light of the recent resignation of Mr Justice Flood, it will be necessary to bring new legislation before the D&aacute;il and Seanad at the earliest possible date in the coming session. This legislation will facilitate the Tribunal in making orders as to costs, arising from the hearings which give rise <Col N="788"/>to the Tribunal&rsquo;s second interim report, in the absence of the former Chairman who alone had presided over those hearings.</P>
    <P LI="1">The Oireachtas will undoubtedly wish to avail of this opportunity to make additional legislative changes which might, for example, simplify existing statutory procedures including the conferring of an express power on a multi-member tribunal to sit in divisions of the same Tribunal. [On the one hand, it is supposed to be there, but on the other, we need legislative provision to do it]. As I made clear in the D&aacute;il last month, I and my colleagues in Government will carefully consider these issues in their entirety in order to produce an effective and legally sustainable set of proposals.</P>
    <P LI="1">I look forward to your cooperation in respect of the forthcoming changes to our tribunals legislation. I will revert to you when the Government has completed its consideration of the possible options for further amendments to the tribunals legislation.</P>
    <P LI="2">Kind regards.</P>
    <P LI="2">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P LI="2">Bertie Ahern T.D.</P>
    <P LI="2">Taoiseach</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is the type of confusion that exists and unwillingness to come to grips with the issue and deal with it properly. The original decision was not to accept Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s offer to deal with costs and stay on, though it would have avoided most of that. However, the simple amendment that is now being put in statutory form to allow the tribunal to examine modules separately was sought for a considerable time. One of the things that Mr. Justice Flood wanted was extra judges and resources so that he could conduct his business properly. Ms Justice Laffoy also wanted extra resources, for the same reason.</P>
    <P>I raise that now because, while we support the legislation, we do not want to give the Minister the impression that we feel that everything is hunky-dory in the tribunals area, since it is not. We would not be in this situation at all today if proper responses had come from the Government. If the Government were doing its job, properly resourcing the tribunals and listening to their chairpersons, who have been writing letter after letter to it protesting at the inadequacies of its response regarding documents and so on, this sort of <i>ad hoc</i> plugging of the gaps when something could have been dealt with generously and properly to ensure that the work of the tribunals is expedited would not have happened.</P>
    <P>When we consider Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s second interim report, produced in 2002, we see the enormous amount of work that he has done. There was a range of activities which no one could have envisaged might come within his ambit. Who would have thought that? When he began the work of looking into Mr. Burke&rsquo;s <Col N="789"/>activities, which obliged him, as he says in his preface, to investigate substantial payments made to Mr. Burke in the course of his long political career, the terms of reference looked good. However, when the ripples went out and the pathways were scrutinised, it was discovered that Mr. Burke had been involved in an enormous plethora of activities with several question marks over virtually all activities where money was involved. That meant that Mr. Justice Flood had to continue his work and expand his area of activity to include land rezoning, radio broadcasting, offshore trusts and corporations. We cannot therefore blame Mr. Justice Flood for the length of time that it has taken the tribunal. It is the subject matter that has required so much time and such an extensive trawl. However, despite all that having taken place, Mr. Justice Flood states in his preface:</P>
    <P LI="2">All citizens have a duty to co-operate and assist a Tribunal and to tell the truth when summoned to appear at a public hearing. It is with considerable regret that I have concluded that I must report, as one of my findings, that certain parties who appeared before me chose not to co-operate with the Tribunal in its task and, further, having been duly sworn did not tell the truth.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is a very serious allegation to have to make. Mr. Justice Flood goes on to say:</P>
    <P LI="2">The extent to which their actions may have involved them in breaches of the criminal law is a matter upon which the Director of Public Prosecutions has absolute and exclusive jurisdiction.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We would have expected that every citizen of this country would co-operate. He goes on to point out that he is mindful of the significant costs incurred in conducting the inquiry to date. He says that he has endeavoured to conduct the inquiry in as economical a fashion as possible, having regard to the rights of the persons appearing before it. He also points out that the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau have informed him that &ldquo;to date, in excess of &euro;34,500,000 has been paid to these bodies in connection with inquiries into Revenue compliance issues arising directly or indirectly from this Tribunal&rdquo;. He says that he believes that to be a significant consequence of the work of the tribunal to date. The impression has been given by the Government&rsquo;s spin doctors that the tribunal is a total waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. However, a great deal more money has been recovered from sources which received corrupt payments or had offshore accounts as a result of Criminal Assets Bureau and Revenue Commissioners investigations.</P>
    <P>The enormous abuse in the planning arena, bribery and corruption, and the unholy trinity of politicians, public servants and developers working hand in hand blighted this city, with ugly developments on greenfield sites turning them <Col N="790"/>into concrete jungles. We really had a party of cowboys riding roughshod over planning. Rezonings should not have taken place, and the brown paper envelope became the motto of the developers in those years. Now the city of Dublin sprawls as far as Kildare and Meath. I noticed that yesterday&rsquo;s big story concerned commuters having to travel up to Cavan to get decent affordable housing. At the moment we have the fiasco over Carrickmines, the Southern Cross and the Jackson Way consortium. Underhand, disreputable, abusive activities took place to allow people motivated only by greed to redesign major sections of this city and rezone it according to the wishes of the developers. That is what this is about, and it is important that it all comes into the public arena. It is very important that we get matters right regarding costs and that there is no opportunity to contest matters in the courts. We must get how the tribunal conducts its business right so that it can do it more expeditiously by having simultaneous parallel modules.</P>
    <P>One issue that has never been addressed, and is not being addressed in this Bill or the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the Commission of Investigations Bill, is costs. It is no good saying that it is being dealt with. Almost all the costs come from the legal profession. Tribunals would cost extraordinarily little if there were not enormous payments of fees to those members of the legal profession participating. The Minister&rsquo;s contribution to this matter, when he was Attorney General, was to increase those fees by &euro;800 a day. That is the man who talks to us about doing something regarding fees. He tells us that the situation is not good enough. He had the chance to do something about it by prescribing terms and conditions and putting in place a package remunerated by a scale of fees. Did he do anything of that nature? No, he merely increased the fees and allowed those members of the legal profession working in the tribunal to become millionaires. This matter must be addressed and the first thrust of legislation should be to ensure that taxpayers receive value for money, not from the tribunal, as that is already the case, but in respect of payment to the legal profession for the work it does.</P>
    <P>The future of tribunals is another important issue. The tribunal of inquiry is the Rolls Royce of inquiries and, as such, it will always be an expensive item. In many cases, however, this type of inquiry is not necessary. To some degree, the Minister, in his Commissions of Investigation Bill, outlines proposals, with which I largely agree, to institute measures, procedures and mechanisms which would result in a gradual approach being taken and the establishment of a full-blown tribunal of inquiry as a last resort.</P>
    <P>While the proposal to have different types of investigation is welcome, the Minister omitted the most important area. Essentially, Members of the Houses are elected to make legislation, govern and ensure that the public administration is scrutinised and nobody is above the law. <Col N="791"/>Although the Oireachtas has a wide-ranging role and broad responsibility, it seems to be regarded as a talking shop which does not exercise the range of powers it should. In other jurisdictions, notably the United States, the committee system has assumed a major role and has considerable powers to deal with matters of this nature, ranging from powers of scrutiny and monitoring, to the power to call to account public servants and those involved in the private sector. This House embarked on that process but was suddenly short-circuited and stymied by the Abbeylara decision.</P>
    <P>The Abbeylara inquiry was an anomaly which did not fall within the normal range of investigations a committee of the House could conduct. Essentially, the case involved a manslaughter offence. The manner in which the House dealt with it &mdash; through a committee &mdash; was not appropriate. The fact that the House ran into a brick wall in that inquiry is not a reason for suddenly stopping and deciding it no longer has any role or powers in this area.</P>
    <P>We should make all the constitutional or legal changes necessary to enable the committee or sub-committee system &mdash; I am currently engaged in the Barron inquiry being conducted by a sub-committee of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights &mdash; to conduct investigations. This could involve the appointment of a parliamentary investigator to perform the role carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the DIRT tax scandal, after which a relevant sub-committee or committee could conduct an investigation. The considerable potential for the committee system to deal with matters requiring investigation should be explored and I hope the Minister takes this on board in the commission of inquiry Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party welcomes this worthy Bill, which fills a gap and thereby creates certainty with regard to the ongoing tribunals. I have, however, three concerns about the legislation with regard to timing, costs and organisation. On the issue of timing, the current tribunals are taking an extraordinarily long time to conclude. It is worse than watching paint dry because we are effectively watching people grow old. I do not believe I had a grey hair on my head in 1997 so time is passing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello&rsquo;s party leader mentioned walking along on his zimmer frame discussing matters with the current Taoiseach following his retirement. The danger is that with time passing, similar concerns persist regarding what is currently unfolding. I am getting a seven year itch about the tribunals as I had hoped to get swift, sharp conclusions. Instead, their progress is akin to walking through treacle and there is a feeling of slow motion to almost every aspect of their deliberations. I suspect that this is allowing further damage to take place not only in Dublin, but throughout the State. I look forward to <Col N="792"/>changes which will allow much sharper, shorter tribunals to be held.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it will not be necessary for tribunals to be as short and sharp as the recent inquiry by Lord Hutton across the water, which, while cheap &mdash; it cost some £1 million or £2 million &mdash; did not produce results with which all of us are enamoured. A happy medium could be found between a timeframe of seven or 14 years and one of several months and I hope we proceed in that direction.</P>
    <P>On the issue of costs, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Costello. It is extraordinary that some of the best legal brains in the country continue to be employed on an hourly basis for years. This is wrong and I am saddened the legislation does not address it because incredible amounts of money are being made by those working for the tribunals. Lengthy tribunals, such as those currently under way, should be permanently staffed by people on secondment from the Civil Service and I regret the Bill does not address the enormity of staff costs.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Although I do not have a legal background, as a planner I am familiar with the workings of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which deals with matters of a quasi-judicial nature on a daily basis and does so in an effective, clear and successful manner. While some of those involved in planning cases use legal teams, the inspectors who consider appeals before An Bord Plean&aacute;la listen carefully to the arguments made by members of the public in layperson&rsquo;s language and translate them into the framework of the planning legislation. It must be possible to do something similar in the case of the tribunals we have established, whether through the Oireachtas committee system or a standing commission of inquiry. The steps we have taken to date on this issue have been wrong, as demonstrated in recent years by the slow pace of progress in the tribunals.</P>
    <P>I will now address a more serious issue, namely, the scope of the tribunals, particularly the Moriarty and Flood tribunals in the area of planning. We should remember that these tribunals only deal with allegations concerning specific land parcels in Dublin. Dubious rezonings are occurring on a monthly basis all around Ireland. Those rezonings are at best bizarre and at worst grotesque. They are neither unbelievable nor unprecedented. We need to get to the heart of the planning difficulties. The curious patchwork of rezonings that took place in north Dublin in the early 1990s is being repeated in the development plans that are currently being compiled around the country.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the process of compiling a development plan must be undertaken. At the very least we should ensure that development plans are referred to an examining body which can examine the sustainability of those plans. Many of the present development plans are not sustainable.</P><Col N="793"/>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to Carrickmines. As we speak the lands north, south-east and west of Carrickmines are being rezoned for development and I am not convinced that is in the best interests of the people of Dublin. I am not convinced that the kind of rezonings that are taking place in Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim and elsewhere in Ireland are in the best interests of the communities they purport to serve.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that planning corruption is not a victimless crime, it affects families, the young and the old. These people are unable to walk to and from a church or the shops and young children are living beside busy main roads without a playground, shops and other amenities nearby. Those decisions are being made as a result of rezonings that appear to be made more in the interests of developers than of communities.</P>
    <P>We should consider the implications that should stem from the planning tribunal, but it is too late because these zonings are being cast in stone and concrete all around the country. It is too late for a generation of Irish families who will be left marooned miles away from public transport and a local shop where they can buy a litre of milk or a newspaper. They are increasingly car-dependent, increasingly caught in traffic and increasingly finding it impossible to buy housing at an affordable price. That is the legacy of the dubious rezonings of the 1980s and 1990s ,and unless there is a swift conclusion to the tribunals, that will also be the legacy for the first decade of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the report of the Law Reform Commission and to the committee of investigations legislation being enacted. I am concerned that by not moving fast enough and by not making fundamental reforms to the process of land zoning and land development, we will be sowing the seeds which will cause problems for future generations of Irish families.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is designed as a contribution towards ensuring the better conduct of the Flood, now Mahon, tribunal. Anything that endeavours to improve the conduct of tribunals is to be welcomed. It must be acknowledged that as sole member, Mr. Justice Flood acted in an impeccable and impartial manner. He rendered the State a considerable service in producing two interim reports that stand out as models of lucidity and clarity of expression. However, there were indications of Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s discomfort with the Government&rsquo;s attitude to the then Flood tribunal as far back as June 2001. At that time, Mr. Justice Flood sought additional assistance by way of extra judges to deal with the massive volume of work that was accumulating. There was a distinct tardiness about the Government&rsquo;s response to his request and the response finally came nine months later just in time for the general election in 2002. No doubt the general election and all the subsequent political machinations were trotted out as reasons for the <Col N="794"/>lengthy delay of another 12 months until Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s request was acceded to. Mr. Justice Flood was willing to remain on as an ordinary member of the tribunal but within the next two weeks he received sufficient bad vibes from the Government to precipitate his absolute and complete resignation.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s attitude to politically sensitive tribunals was clear for all to see in the fumbling, bumbling response to the changing circumstances brought on by the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. There is something that is somewhat strange and sinister about the circumstances that forced two eminent, distinguished members of the Judiciary such as Mr. Justice Flood and Ms Justice Laffoy to take the ultimate step of resignation from tribunals of inquiry into two of the most fundamental issues which are of concern to most people in Ireland today, corruption in planning matters and child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>This Bill is largely concerned with the matter of the current chairperson in dealing with costs that were incurred prior to his appointment and which were not determined by Mr. Justice Flood. This task could have been made considerably easier had the Government acceded to Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s expressed willingness to remain as an ordinary member of the tribunal. This was an excellent and logical offer and I do not understand why the Government refused it. Apart from the clarity of Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s opinions and judgments, it would have ensured continuity and would have been of considerable assistance to the chairperson in the determination of costs.</P>
    <P>The Flood-Mahon tribunal has been of significant importance in revealing the seedy side of the planning process, particularly in County Dublin. It brought the activities of a coterie of individuals to public notice. The tribunal has had a domino effect in that each revelation spawned further revelations of improper practice and various whistle blowers emerged to open further cans of worms. I wonder how many other cans of worms exist which are undiscovered, never mind unopened. I am sure there are people who are not sleeping well at night. It would be foolhardy to think that Dublin is the only area where planning corruption happens. I have no doubt that the rest of the country is not snow white in this regard.</P>
    <P>The investigations have been aided by many crusading journalists such as the irrepressible Mr. Charlie Bird, Mr. Frank Connolly and Mr. Jody Corcoran, with nightly reprises by Mr. Vincent Browne and the tribunal team. It became an excellent radio soap, regrettably based on fact, even though it sounded like fiction. Unfortunately, the pace of tribunals has been slow and ponderous and they have been extremely expensive and somewhat unwieldy. The findings cannot be used as evidence in subsequent legal proceedings. A further question <Col N="795"/>arising from this tribunal is the reason so few powerful people have been brought to account.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a growing dissatisfaction with tribunals generally. I have no doubt that legal firms and lawyers lick their lips at the possible mention of a tribunal. It is a little like winning a lotto without buying a ticket. The public are sceptical and rightly so. It is important the Judge Mahon be facilitated to the greatest extent so that public cynicism can be eliminated and the tribunal enabled to act with improved efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Bill will shore up the legal position of Judge Mahon against the demands of those who have been judged to have hindered and obstructed the tribunal during Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s service. I am happy to note this provision will have a retrospective effect and those whose activities have been exposed by the tribunals will have no such redress against the taxpayers. It is important that Judge Mahon&rsquo;s other judicial colleagues on the tribunal will be enabled to sit separately and to conduct various modules of the tribunal concurrently.</P>
    <P>I wish the Flood-Mahon tribunal well and hope it will complete its investigations and deliberations with all due speed.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. It is a sad day when the House must deal with an issue such as tribunals of inquiry. It saddens me because the integrity of politics is damaged when we must deal with this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Ireland, once known as the land of saints and scholars, is now better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. There has been an erosion of confidence in sectors such as politics, banking, the media, the Church and the legal profession in the wake of the scandals I have mentioned. The consequent profound impact on our value systems has forced many people to seek other sources of moral and ethical guidance.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s development as a fairly prosperous country has led to certain dilemmas. Society has to make difficult decisions about awkward questions such as the distribution of resources. Many people&rsquo;s credibility has been seriously tainted by the damaging scandals which have been investigated by tribunals. Poverty is endemic in many areas of Irish society, but perhaps the most serious form of poverty that exists in this country is the poverty of leadership. The Ireland of the thousand welcomes is dying. It is time to draw a line in the sand and to stop the rot. Our people are not looking for miracles &mdash; they want straight answers, decent leadership and political guidance.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House deals with an issue of concern which arose following the resignation in June 2003 of Mr. Justice Flood as chairperson and a member of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, or the <Col N="796"/>Flood tribunal. The issue relates to the determination of applications by parties for costs arising from the tribunal&rsquo;s findings, in respect of certain modules contained in the Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, which was published in September 2002. The modules were dealt with at a time when Mr. Justice Flood was the sole member of the tribunal and the second interim report was accordingly prepared by him.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for an express power for a tribunal, on its own volition, to seek the direction of the High Court relating to the performance of its functions, including those relating to costs. Similar provision is provided for inspectors appointed under the Companies Act 1990 and a somewhat similar provision is also contained in section 25 of the 2000 Act which established the Laffoy commission. It is also proposed to provide an express statutory power, vested in the chairp</P>
    <P>erson, to direct other members of a tribunal which has more than one member to sit as separate divisions and to determine the conditions that will apply, including the preparation of reports.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill amends section 4 of the 1997 Act by providing for a new section 4A which provides for the tribunal, or the chairperson if the tribunal has more than one member, whenever it or he or she considers it appropriate to do so, to apply to the High Court for directions relating to the performance of any of the functions of the tribunal or the chairperson, including their functions relating to costs. I welcome this positive and progressive step.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions. However, we should not lose sight of the real issues in the debate about tribunals. When discussing tribunals, we have to examine the wider questions for society. I have raised such questions because the public will switch off in greater numbers if we do not consider them. Bribery and corruption are widely accepted as part of the political process. I totally reject the usual claim that all politicians, particularly those in this House, are all the same. The major political parties have to bear some responsibility for this perception. It is not good enough to say that political donations to major political parties from big businesses and large companies do not influence wider political decisions. I disagree with the three major political parties in this regard. The sad political reality is that the big boys and girls hang out with the big political parties. It is the shame of the tribunals and the scandals.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that officials involved in this game are not forgotten in this debate. When I travelled around the country recently, many citizens told me of their suspicions and genuine concerns that public officials, especially those involved in planning, are &ldquo;on the take&rdquo;. History has proved that such concerns are founded on a legitimate basis. It is essential that we root out all forms of serious corruption in this <Col N="797"/>State. The public demands confidence in politicians. Cabinet Ministers and others, such as the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, should show leadership by dealing with the suspicions and allegations I have mentioned. I accept that this Bill is part of that process. I demand action on these issues. Successive Governments &mdash; I do not blame this Government alone &mdash; have stayed silent on these important matters. We should speak openly in this debate about the crisis in our political life. I long for the day when these tribunals will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I support the legitimate concerns of many people about the length of time the tribunals are taking and the amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money that is being spent. I would like shorter and more efficient tribunals that stay within their budgets. We should seek a new and radical system of dealing with corruption and other tribunal issues. Constructive alternatives should be sought and good practice elsewhere should be examined. I have been told that there is an effective system in place to deal with such scandals in Germany. We should open our minds and look to other countries for examples of good practice which are more efficient and less time-consuming and which stick to their budgets. We cannot allow people to run up significant costs. People should be able to stay within their budgets. When tribunals are being established, a specific deadline should be set and the resources available should be made clear.</P>
    <P>I accept that we have to ensure that everyone is treated in a fair and just manner. We cannot allow politicians and those involved in big business to disrupt and delay tribunals &mdash; it is not an option. The people are sick to the teeth of the tactics employed by some people to delay tribunals. If we want to alleviate the public&rsquo;s boredom with tribunals, we should make them fair and efficient and we should ensure that they do not exceed their budgets. Such matters are the subject of this debate and this legislation, which I support.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that one of the reasons so many Independent Members have been elected to this D&aacute;il is that people have lost trust in the major political parties. The increase in the number of Independent Deputies has resulted from this loss of trust.</P>

	<P>The people lost trust in the three major political parties and decided to seek an alternative.

   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with scandals, so it is right that I should refer to this scandal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to refer to the Bill before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that I highlight the fact that elected Members of this House are being censored because of their political views. It is time for certain people in the media to take a look at themselves. It is sad and possibly a matter for another tribunal that democratic results are not accepted by some people.</P>
    <P>When one speaks about scandals, one does not refer only to politicians. I mentioned earlier that public officials are also involved in this regard. In the past, many people who had information about planning matters and similar scandals were intimidated into saying nothing about these issues. Staying silent about planning matters and corruption in public life is not an option. This debate on the tribunals is important for that reason. I will return to many of my criticisms of the media in the future. I will support this positive Bill, which contains some constructive proposals. Some of the problems encountered by tribunals result from the delaying tactics that are pursued by some people and the out-dated procedures that have to be followed. A new, radical and fresh look at these procedures must be taken. If other states have progressive ways of dealing with these kinds of issues, I urge the Government to investigate them in the interests of good practice. I welcome the Bill and will support it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity that Second Stage gives us to expand on its content and the issues around it. I am conscious that there are a number of different tribunals and it is a sensitive issue due to public reaction to them and politicians. At the same time, as politicians, we need to give leadership. If that leadership entails putting forward suggestions that are different and radical, then we should not be afraid to use this debate to do so. The Government has been upfront in dealing with all the tribunals. It has not only established various tribunals to deal with matters, it has also funded them and monitored their progress. The amount of paperwork that public representatives have to complete at national and local level is a further indication of the commitment of the Government to keep everything on the straight and narrow. Public representatives, selected by the public to hold important office, are reminded of their responsibilities in the work they undertake on behalf of the public on a daily basis. There is no harm in this.</P>
    <P>However, I urge caution because what is required in terms of accountability for public representatives could go overboard. As we continue to monitor accountability, establishing a norm in an ever-changing situation is difficult. However, we will arrive at a point of best practice as we move along. When we do, that best practice must be applied to everyone holding public office and public officials across the board. Deputy Finian McGrath referred to the various pillars of the community such as politicians, the Garda, the church and the State. These institutions, in which everyone had such confidence, are now being questioned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The media?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be no harm either.</P>
    <P>The public&rsquo;s confidence in these institutions is shattered. It was right to demand the establishment of the tribunals because what happened in the past was shocking. However, it must also be remembered that there were honest and decent people who were part and parcel of public life and these institutions and who never did wrong in their lives but served their communities well with distinction. It is unfair of us in this House, the media or the general public to tarnish every political party or profession with the one brush. As leaders in our communities and Members of the D&aacute;il, we must constantly remind people that it was a small minority who brought the various professions into disrepute, through what we see on a daily basis at the tribunals. Members owe it to themselves and the people they represent to do just that and not to be afraid of media criticism for doing so. I am conscious that it is a sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>While I agree that these tribunals were established to deal with certain issues, the framework in which they are working must now <Col N="800"/>be examined, particularly from a public accounts perspective. I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this matter. In one instance, I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle that the Minister in question had no official responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for these matters which fall within the remit of the tribunals, which are statutory independent bodies. I accept this but we are also responsible to the taxpayers as to how their money is spent. At the Committee of Public Accounts, members see the actual costs of many these tribunals.</P>
    <P>In answer to a parliamentary question in November 2003, I was informed that the Moriarty tribunal, up to the end of September, had cost &euro;14.2 million. At that time, senior counsel were paid &euro;2,500 per day; junior counsel, &euro;2,000 per day; senior research counsel, &euro;571 per day; junior research counsel, &euro;381 per day. Up to the 7 September 2003, the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments had incurred costs of almost &euro;30 million. Senior counsel earned &euro;2,250 per day while junior counsel earned &euro;1,500. The reply also outlined the number of solicitors employed, two of whom were paid &euro;1,000 per day while the remainder earned &euro;450 per day. These figures are not just for sitting days. Other costs accrue for the ongoing work of the tribunals on non-sitting days. Factored into those costs is also the time spent by the various Departments called for cross-examination. The time of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be included in this, which I am sure continues to be monitored.</P>
    <P>These are the costs we know. There are also costs that still have to be assessed. In a reply to another parliamentary question I tabled, I was informed that these costs will be dealt with after submissions are heard. However, it is not known what figures are involved. The reply stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">... matters pertaining to the award of costs are normally decided by the chairman at the end of a tribunal inquiry and his or her decision is then announced to a costs hearing. The costs hearing is held in public after the publication of his or her report.</P>
    <P FLI="0">There is an onus on the Government and this Parliament to get our heads around how much these tribunals will cost exactly. Members need to know, as any business would demand, to what costs the State will be exposed. There is a growing cynicism in this regard. People now ask how many hip replacements could have been done or how many MRI scanners put in place for the money that was spent on the tribunals. These are valid questions which Members need to answer. I am not undermining the tribunals or taking away from their work, but there must be a better way.</P>
    <P>The tribunals have been of some financial benefit to the State. In reply to another parliamentary question, I was informed that amounts recovered by the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau <Col N="801"/>from follow-up investigations of the beef tribunal, Moriarty tribunal and Flood-Mahon tribunal were &euro;5.4 million, &euro;6.9 million, &euro;35.7 million, respectively. This is a financial comeback to the State from the tribunals and the Revenue Commissioners are to be commended for the work they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? We should take the valuable work that has been carried out by the tribunals and look at introducing a different system. We must begin to wind down the tribunals as we know them but use their findings. This could all be then factored into the work undertaken by various Oireachtas committees. There is much talk about reform of the D&aacute;il and giving greater power to Oireachtas committees. Perhaps they can undertake some of the work of the tribunals at a much lower cost and bring it to a point where the findings can be handed over to other agencies of the State. Apart from the Oireachtas committees, the CAB and the Revenue Commissioners now have additional powers which should be taken into account. The findings of the tribunals should be handed over to those bodies, and perhaps a reformed set of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>If there is to be some form of ongoing tribunal structure it should be such that we would know where it begins and ends, what the cost is now and what it is likely to be. It is not sensible for the business of this House or this State to be conducted on the basis that we pay millions of euro some time in the future. That undermines the belief that people should have in the political structures. The public is quite cynical about these matters but it grows doubtful of the legal profession when it sees how much is paid to the tribunals and to the lawyers.</P>
    <P>The public is satisfied now that tribunals have confirmed that something went wrong in the past. It did not want the tribunals to continue indefinitely. If people are found guilty and are brought through the court system &mdash; which could also be used in the context of these tribunals &mdash; they should be penalised. I have no problem with that, my concern is the ongoing high cost of the tribunals. Perhaps that money could be reduced and used more efficiently in the delivery of services through other Departments to fulfil other agendas. We can spend only a certain length of time raking over the ashes of our cowboy past. People do not want us to do that forever. They want a beginning and an end.</P>
    <P>I urge the Members and the Minister to begin to consider where we go from here. With so many positive developments happening in our communities, we risk damaging our future by remaining trapped in this tribunal syndrome and not dealing with it effectively and efficiently. When I was first elected to this House in 1997, the tribunals began to roll out. Since then most of my time in national politics has been spent listening to this kind of debate and watching the tribunals. It is time we lowered the curtain on this, provided there is a new structure in place to <Col N="802"/>continue this work at a lower cost. I welcome the Bill and encourage the Government to consider the points I have raised and which other Members believe should be debated and finalised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Like most other speakers in this debate I give my full backing to this Bill. I have been following this matter reasonably closely over recent months. From a layman&rsquo;s point of view I cannot understand why we had to bring it in. If there was the slightest chance that this retrospective element could be challenged, we owe it to the taxpayers and every law-abiding citizen to let no one go by default. If, for whatever reason, there happened to be a successful court challenge, the people who were deemed to be corrupt and to have bribed their way through life would somehow or other get off on a technicality. That is the bottom line and people can see that.</P>
    <P>I have no legal background but I have a deep interest in these matters. Mr. Justice Flood did an excellent job given that the tribunal was fully public, and its every deliberation appeared in the national media, <i>ad nauseam</i>. It has been a staple media diet for the past seven years. Eminent lawyers challenged every comma and dot of any description at the tribunal, as their job required. I do not understand why, when Judge Mahon replaced Mr. Justice Flood, any thought of retrospection emerged or why anybody would go to the High Court or Supreme Court to argue that somehow Judge Mahon was not in a position to continue the work done by Mr. Justice Flood. It would be different if parts of this tribunal were not held in public or if the various parties were not properly and legally represented on the occasion. If there is the slightest possibility of an appeal to a higher court, we must ensure that route is closed off immediately. I assume we will achieve that by passing this legislation today. How many senior and junior counsel believe this was necessary? What is the personal view of the Minister of State who is a lawyer? It probably depends on whom one asks. Many members of the public cannot understand the basis for this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for us to reflect on the tribunal culture. I gave evidence in a peripheral way to the beef tribunal. One could argue that was not our finest hour but tribunals have become more successful since then. Deputy Costello spoke in detail about the future of tribunals. If Ministers had answered the questions they were asked in this House there would have been no need for the Mahon tribunal. I am a Member of this House for a long time and I have seen it all. There is a culture that full information is not given to Members who ask parliamentary questions. I find it difficult to understand that culture. If a question is asked on behalf of the people &mdash; that is what we are elected to do &mdash; it should be answered fully and truthfully. I am talking about the culture of drip feeding information and the <Col N="803"/>attitude that if a specific question is not asked, there is no need to give an answer.</P>
    <P>That culture has given rise to the new phenomenon of tribunals. Efforts were made over the years through various Garda investigations, particularly in terms of the Dublin planning problems, but they did not get anywhere. I do not understand why that was the case, but I assume the Garda did not have the necessary investigative powers or expertise because this was a new phenomenon. We would not know what we know today if it had not been for the Flood tribunal. What we know is nothing short of extraordinary. I assume the public cannot be blamed for saying that if it happened in one area, it must have also happened in many other areas. I would be the last person to say that the effects of the tribunals have been good for this country. However, the public can say that only for the tribunals, it would not have known what happened.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the coin, although I do not want to go back over everything that was said this morning. We must always get value for money. I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for the past year or two and sometimes I am goggle-eyed at what I hear there. We have a professional Comptroller and Auditor General, we cross-examine witnesses and there are certain powers associated with that. There is the potential to set up certain types of committees in the Oireachtas, as was proven conclusively during the DIRT inquiry. I agree with Deputy Costello about the Abbeylara incident. I understand how we could face big problems. I do not have a legal background, but when that controversy broke, I understood how it ran into trouble. The committee system could be used to examine other areas.</P>
    <P>I know the public is cynical about politicians and many other people. I do not spend a lot of time talking about this issue or studying the profession of which I am a part because that would mean I would not do anything. As regards the image of politicians, the more power we have, provided it is used properly and with dignity, the more the electorate will see that we are worth our salaries. Many people believe we are not worth what we get, regardless of what we do. One must work seven days a week to stay in this House.</P>
    <P>We have an ideal opportunity to talk about what will happen post-tribunals, which will not last forever. The public do not want that to happen. I have estimated the costs of all the tribunals to date at more than £100 million. That is a huge figure. There is no sign of the tribunals coming to an end, which means that figure could double or treble. If someone had come into the House on the day we introduced the legislation for the Goodman tribunal many years ago and said it would be the start of something which could cost &euro;300 million, there would have been another debate in the Chamber. We must strike a counter-balance. Some feeble efforts are being <Col N="804"/>made in that regard. I hope the new legislation ensures that tribunal modules are run in parallel with each other. That will not make the tribunals any cheaper, but it will speed up the process. It is a long time for someone to have to wait for seven, ten, 15 or 20 years for justice to be seen to be done. Many tribunals will have outlived their usefulness by then. We must decide the future of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for judicial reviews. However, we must use the Oireachtas committee system, as is done in the United States and other countries. We know the public will support that, particularly after the progress made at the DIRT inquiry. The public was happy with that inquiry.</P>
    <P>As regards tribunal payments, I cannot understand what is happening. If someone is lucky enough to be involved as a senior or junior counsel or as a legal researcher in a long-running tribunal, it is like having a golden goose. I find it difficult to accept the payment per day system. I know it has been ingrained in the legal profession for many years where they get so much money per day for court cases. However, when a deal is being made with someone to build a road, the Government knows the length of the road and the costs involved and people are given an opportunity to tender. Once it is established that the contractors are efficient, the lowest tender is accepted. That is the way business is done in the commercial world. However, that does not happen in the legal world. It seems that one only has to be lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time because the Government will not say a contract must be completed within a certain period of time. We must change that because the public will not accept it. It was all right in the past five or six years because there was plenty of money available. However, once the belt begins to tighten and people find it difficult to buy their own homes, they will become cynical and more questions will be asked. It is up to the Government and all Opposition parties to resolve that issue.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Justice Flood sought help for his tribunal, everyone, including the dogs in the street, knew he had a good reason for doing that. He knew the tribunal proceedings were dragging on too long and that more important information was in the pipeline. He knew in his heart that if it were allowed to continue the way it was going, it would be years before the culprits would be brought before the courts. It is difficult to understand the reaction of the Government at the time. It dithered and dallied for nearly a year before it did anything. Would it have been happier if the matter took 20 years? Perhaps it thought some of the nasty items raised would reflect badly on the Government. Had it reached the stage that it did not care what happened?</P>
    <P>As far as the Government was concerned, it could rumble along and to hell with what anybody thought. It is very difficult to understand. I believe the Government wanted it <Col N="805"/>to drift along for years so that the public would get tired of it. While I am not sure whether the public are getting tired, if they discover that another &euro;100 million has been spent on an item when better value could have been found elsewhere, there will be more debates in this House and there will be more controversy.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is delighted to back the Bill before us. In effect it will ensure the big day is coming for the people who were involved in bribery and corruption, those on the inner circle, the viruses of this life, the highway robbers and those who ensured it was almost impossible for young people to buy a house. When that day comes it will send a signal to the people that anybody who gets involved in that kind of activity in the future is on the highway to nowhere. Whatever else we do in modern Ireland, we will not put up with that carry on. I will be happy if this Bill is a small stepping-stone towards that outcome.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I was going to refer to it as an important Bill. However, one has to understand that it only arises to deal with a technicality that may be used by some lawyers on behalf of those who have caused considerable difficulties to the nation in recent years. These people have made every effort to frustrate beyond belief the efforts of Mr. Justice Flood to bring this matter to conclusion. If his efforts to get to the truth had not been thwarted by some of these people, Mr. Justice Flood would have completed the tribunal long ago and we would not need to introduce this Bill to give Judge Mahon powers that may have to be used to decide costs etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and fairly concise and will allow the new chairman to address the matter of the costs of those who have frustrated the tribunal. It will rightly force those who should pay to do so. In his speech, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;section 3 of the Bill also provides an express power to the chairperson to direct other members of the tribunal, where there is more than one member, to sit as separate divisions and to determine the conditions that will apply, including the preparation of reports.&rdquo; This is very important, as it should speed up the operation of tribunals because it will no longer be necessary for one judge to hear all the modules.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers referred to the &ldquo;cowboy past&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; is certainly relevant when discussing the beef tribunal. Given events that have taken place in recent months, one has to wonder whether such activity is in the past. There was the case of the Punchestown millions. I was a member of the committee that discussed that matter. We were not informed how that decision was made. We were only asked to approve money for it. We took the word of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on that matter. However, having seen how it transpired, it is not possible to say that the cowboy past has gone.</P><Col N="806"/>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I was saying it was not just a matter of the cowboy past, we have a cowboy present also. I mentioned the Punchestown millions and the recent developments in Kenmare. The Taoiseach stood up in the House without apology and admitted he had helped out his good friend and colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, because he believed it was important for democracy. However, he is talking about taxpayers&rsquo; money. We have heard criticisms today that the tribunals are wasting money, but the matters I mentioned are typical examples of wasting money.</P>
    <P>In the past 48 hours we heard about the Government&rsquo;s intention to remove the power to distribute money from dormant accounts from a committee which was set up by the House, under legislation, for that purpose and give control to a Minister instead. I wonder what the reason for this is. Some people say it is for a slush fund, while others have other suggestions. Why were Members of this Chamber brought together to discuss a Bill to create an organisation to deal with what was then thought to be a small amount of money? When the Government saw there was much more money than previously expected, and much more political value to be obtained from its distribution, it dispensed with the committee and assumed control.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness mentioned the cowboy past, but we still have a long way to go before we can become true democrats, remaining true to what is said in the Chamber. A body was created based on the groups that were supposed to benefit from the dormant accounts. The Minister of State may sigh all he likes, but this is a retrograde step and the matter will hang around the Minister&rsquo;s neck.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this have anything to do with the Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Government&rsquo;s spokesperson who spoke of the cowboy past, so <Col N="807"/>what I am saying is relevant to the debate. The only reason this Bill is before the House is that scandals have occurred. The problem started with the beef scandal and it has continued in many other areas since then. The cost of these tribunals to ordinary people is large and they are becoming fed up with it. I presume the Government is happy to allow the tribunals to run on because the longer they run, the less relevant they become. People begin to believe these matters are all in the past. I have no apology, as an Opposition spokesperson, for telling the House that unfortunately it is not all in the past.</P>
    <P>The beef tribunal was buried in a valuable agreement with Northern Ireland. There was a real effort to bury it. It was a very important issue. The beef tribunal possibly saved the single biggest industry in this country from complete collapse because there was a realisation that things needed to be done in a proper and just manner. The cost of these tribunals, however, is an enormous problem. One of the first steps taken by the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s senior Minister when he came into the House was to increase the moneys available to the legal profession in this area. This has resulted in much cynicism among the public. While one group of people is being told to roll up their sleeves and make do with less money, those in lucrative positions are told they are doing well and are to have more.</P>
    <P>The cost of the tribunals is a real cause for anxiety. I am afraid this sort of discussion may put the public off tribunals even more. It is important to spell out that, with the cost, there are benefits. One benefit is that the system is being cleaned up. Another is that although the lawyers and other experts in the tribunals system are very highly paid, they pay very high taxes. When somebody says that &euro;40 million has been spent on a tribunal, that is not the real cost to the taxpayer as much of it comes back in tax. There is also the fact that through the Flood tribunal and others, taxes are being recovered because illegal actions that took place in the past are being revealed. Members of the House often cry about tribunal costs, saying they are unjust and they should be used for hospitals and other purposes, but those are not the real facts. The Government should make sure that money is available for hospitals and so on, but the tribunals must stand in their own right.</P>
    <P>The real reason for the tribunals is the Government&rsquo;s failure to answer questions. We recently had statements in the House and when it came to the time allotted for questions, two questions were asked in 20 minutes. To put it mildly, the waffle that was said in answer to those questions left much to be desired. In other assemblies, although Prime Ministers perhaps do not spend as much time in attendance, they certainly answer questions in a much more direct and positive way. If this Parliament is to mean anything we must make sure that genuine <Col N="808"/>answers are given when questions are asked and that Ministers do not burn up time speaking from a script for the two or three minutes allotted to them. We must make sure this is done.</P>
    <P>It is fine for the Minister to read out a script based on a Bill. I appreciate that is what we are here to discuss. The Bill has some valuable aspects. It is to be made legally possible for Judge Mahon to obtain costs from the relevant people. It is also to be made possible for others to take part in modules so that things may be speeded up. Former Deputies Burke and Lawlor have been through the process and now former Deputy Flynn is to come before the tribunal. Much of the problems we must deal with today exist because the former two have opted to frustrate the efforts of the Flood tribunal, and that is a fact. Anyone who studies the tribunals can plainly seen that the system has been frustrated throughout. There have been denials and refusals to produce literature. It is vital that the people who cause these problems should pay for them to be fixed. The honest citizens of the State should not have to pay. Those who caused the problems should pay the bill.</P>
    <P>There is a committee structure in the House, although the media do not give it much publicity. Deputy Perry, who is present, is Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts which does an excellent job. It highlights the waste and mismanagement that occurs throughout the system. We need to improve the structures of the committees so they can deal with the problems that arise. If answers are not given in the House, the committees could deal with the issues to a greater extent and avoid, as much as possible, matters going to tribunals. There is a list of tribunals and these give rise to costs which would not be incurred if committees of this House were strengthened. I accept that certain cases, such as the Abbeylara case, are legally difficult.</P>
    <P>The D&aacute;il has structures like the committees and Question Time and I am satisfied that they, especially Question Time, have been abused. This week, for example, I tabled a parliamentary question about a cross-Border road which I believed could have been dealt with through the North-South structures. The reply, however, stated that the matter would have to be dealt with by the National Roads Authority. The NRA has nothing to do with cross-Border roads until there is a political agreement. If there were such an agreement, they could be dealt with by the NRA if it is given that remit. These are the things that frustrate Members. I support the Bill but greater effort should be directed at making this House more workable and constructive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Timmins. I support this important Bill. One does not need to be a genius to see that public confidence in our public institutions will suffer a major blow if any decision on the issue of costs arising from legal representation before the Mahon tribunal is overturned on the grounds that <Col N="809"/>the tribunal must honour the established practice that costs must be decided by the judge who tried the case. Sadly, in spite of the importance of a prompt Government response to this challenge, it is no surprise to welcome this Bill over six months after the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and 18 months after the publication of the second interim report of the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <P>This lack of urgency is entirely in keeping with the lethargy of the Government in supporting the work of the several tribunals of inquiry under way. In one sense, I sympathise with the Taoiseach that the Mahon tribunal will begin hearings on the Gilmartin module at a time when the peace process is in stalemate, Ireland has the honour of holding the Presidency of the EU and the European Parliament and local elections are imminent. The next phase of the Mahon tribunal might place the leader of this country under even greater pressure given his already difficult schedule.</P>
    <P>At times it seems as if the Mahon tribunal has been hanging over the political and planning system for an eternity. The public&rsquo;s interest has flagged, as is reflected in their attendance at the hearings in Dublin Castle. However, the tribunals continue. The Taoiseach has only himself to blame for the fact that this module is only now being publicly scrutinised in the Mahon tribunal, seven years after it was established. It is an outrageous length of time. I am not sure if the Statute of Limitations applies to this tribunal, but it is extraordinary that it has been ongoing since 1997.</P>
    <P>Clearly, our tribunals have been under-resourced in comparison with their UK counterparts, most notably the recent Hutton inquiry and the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday. Approximately 55 lawyers are working for the latter inquiry. In contrast, the Government expects the Mahon tribunal, with only about a half dozen lawyers, to conduct an inquiry into the hundreds, if not thousands, of developments that fall within its remit. It is unbelievable, especially when one considers that this inquiry gives value for money because cash has come to the Revenue Commissioners as a result.</P>
    <P>The fact that some of the tribunal&rsquo;s investigations have encountered poor levels of co-operation should be reflected in future decisions on the legal costs of representation. It is baffling how one year of the tribunal&rsquo;s work was devoted to Mr. Raphael Burke&rsquo;s finances while another year, 2001, focused on the relationship between Mr. Burke and Century Radio. The tribunal only sat for 85 days, which is hardly satisfactory for a body established to investigate matters of urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the concept of value for money is of great importance to me. Would it not have made more sense for the Government to have given the tribunal sufficient resources to prosecute this inquiry in the shortest possible amount of time? <Col N="810"/>After all, the further one moves in time from an event, the less valuable information relating to that event usually becomes. The inquiry is dealing with modules dating from seven years ago and the timescale for its work in the future has not been determined. Mr. Justice Flood operated manfully within these constraints but why did the Government give such an impossible mission to this individual who has given such service to the State? Has the Government learned from this mistake by appointing tribunal members who are younger or is this a sign that the tribunal still has decades to run? The fact that Mr. Justice Flood had so little time left before retirement and that the tribunal was under-resourced put huge pressure on him in making a determination on fees.</P>
    <P>In a benign interpretation of history, the Government has shown the same lack of direction in this instance as when public spending went out of control in the two years preceding the previous general election. It is a matter of public record that almost a year elapsed between Mr. Justice Flood writing to the Government to ask it to appoint more judges to the inquiry and the Government agreeing to his request. That was extraordinary. One would have imagined that there would have been a quicker response in light of the public pressure for information. Instead, it took the Government a year to reply. It is unbelievable that this was the level of priority given to this important request.</P>
    <P>There are those who would argue that the Government is in no hurry to bring this tribunal to a speedy conclusion. That would be regrettable. There is a great deal of media interest in this inquiry and it is regrettable that it is only dealing with modules that occurred seven years ago and that it has taken so long in its task. Let us compare that with what happened in the Hutton and Saville inquiries in the UK. It does not convey the message that we are doing our business in an efficient, effective way. The snail-like progress of this tribunal has resulted in a cloud being cast over the profession of politics and all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that my professional colleagues on the Government side have not pressed the Government to act with genuine urgency in this matter. It is far more difficult to restore confidence in politics while it suffers Chinese water torture in Dublin Castle. This affects the perception of inquiries and planning matters. There is a level of apathy within the political system and this can be seen in the local elections. We urge people to exercise their right to vote but the inquiries and what happened many years ago cast a large shadow. The existence of ethics in public office legislation, which is welcome and generally complied with, is overshadowed by the investigations of events that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. The Mahon tribunal is in profit as more than &euro;34 million has been recovered by the Revenue Commission and the Criminal Assets Bureau as a result of the <Col N="811"/>revelations. This is welcome. However, politics continues to pay an inestimable price while this cloud hangs overhead. For how much longer can we continue to pay this price? We must get an answer to this question.</P>
    <P>The press is cynical of the political system and the level of delay in tribunals. For example, it has taken a full year to deal with the proceedings dealing with the finances of the former Minister, Ray Burke. Proceedings have been delayed also as a result of many of the key players taking cases to the High Court or not complying with Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s remit and powers. It is regrettable that we did not deal with this in a business-like manner, that the tribunal only sat 85 days and that the Government waited for a year before appointing additional judges.</P>
    <P>The most important element of the Bill, which I hope the Government will adopt, is the provision to provide an express statutory power for the chairperson &mdash; if the tribunal has more than one member &mdash; to direct other members of it to sit at separate divisions and to determine the conditions that will apply, including the preparation of reports. This is important. I hope the Government will take it on board and that it will ensure that other modules are set up to run in parallel with the tribunal. There is no reason this should not be done because the tribunal is self-financing and &euro;34 million has already been collected. There are also enough legal people eligible for appointment who could work in parallel with Judge Mahon to bring this matter to a swift conclusion.</P>
    <P>As a parliamentarian, I remind the Minister of State that certain matters at the heart of some of our costly long-running tribunals would never have occurred if this House had been allowed to do its job properly by the Government of the day. In this context, it is ironic that the Seanad debate on this issue was rushed through with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, refusing to take Opposition amendments on board. The Attorney General&rsquo;s office does not hold the monopoly on legal wisdom but, by guillotining important amendments, the Minister of State appears to believe it does. Constructive amendments made by the Opposition should not be dismissed out of hand. The fact that there was a guillotine on such an important issue is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The most radical proposal of the Bill is the provision allowing the chairperson of a tribunal to establish separate divisions of a tribunal of inquiry under another member of the tribunal. This vehicle, if used properly, has the potential to bring the Mahon tribunal to a speedy conclusion. While the issue of legal costs are of great importance, they come second to the democratic imperative of ending these tribunals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This amending legislation is critically important. There was a major debate on this issue back in 1997 when the tribunal was established. The powers given to Mr. Justice Flood at the <Col N="812"/>time, the lack of co-operation by the Government, the Chinese torture method of inquiry and the length of the inquiry &mdash; now seven years &mdash; are regrettable. A clear timescale should be set out for the conclusion of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is important to bring about a resolution. The Bill provides for an express power for a tribunal, of its own volition, to seek the direction of the High Court on the performance and functions of the tribunal, including costs. There would be a major outcry if the State had to take up the costs. This would be outrageous and a travesty of justice. A similar provision for the appointment of an inspectorate is contained in the Companies Act 1990 and in section 25 of the Act establishing the Laffoy commission.</P>
    <P>The express purpose of the Bill is to provide certainty to the current chairperson of the tribunal. This is important in dealing with issues concerning the awarding of costs and to avoid ambiguity. Owing to the current situation, it is proposed, out of an abundance of caution, to insert a new subsection (6), which is welcome, to the effect that a person who is the sole member of a tribunal, or the chairperson, may make an order with regard to any costs incurred before his or her appointment which have not already been determined. In exercising this power, the sole member or chairperson shall have regard to any report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment. These new provisions will apply to tribunals appointed and costs incurred before or after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These provisions of the legislation &mdash; the determination of costs, the power given to the chairperson and parallel inquiries &mdash; are of critical importance. The Bill is important and the Government must provide the resources for it. The tribunal is self-financing and the Minister should appoint several other judges who will run parallel modules. We do not need a continuance of the Chinese torture over many more years. I appeal to the Minister to bring politics back to the level of respect it should have.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing his time with me. This relatively simple Bill is <Col N="813"/>important. While the sole member will be given the authority to decide costs, what strikes the public are the costs involved in the running of the tribunals. A solicitor in whose judgment I put much store recently stated that a senior counsel will not get out of bed in the morning unless he is offered &euro;10,000. This is amazing. I am not that familiar with the legal profession but some of those on the Government side of the House are. The issue of legal fees has a knock-on impact. A similar situation arises in the case of housing. When a house in Sorrento Road in Deputy Andrews&rsquo;s constituency sells for &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million, the knock-on impact eventually affects a house in Kiltimagh or somewhere. We see the same effect on legal bills. I do not understand why they are so large.</P>
    <P>When driving home last night I heard an item about the Barr tribunal. I had to rack my brains to recall what the Barr tribunal was investigating. There are so many tribunals that I did not know whether it was investigating the smoking ban, the legal profession or what. We are almost losing count of the number of tribunals we have. We must examine a different mechanism to run them or by which to avoid establishing them. The present tribunals have almost become part of our folklore, like &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, but unfortunately, if they were television programmes, they would probably be censored. Some of the material coming out, while quite comical, is damaging and almost unbelievable. We must admit, as we listen to reconstructions, that they give us the odd chuckle.</P>
    <P>I would never have believed that corruption existed to the extent that it has been portrayed. We were used to the catchphrase &ldquo;All politicians are corrupt&rdquo;. Now we can see from where this belief emanated. A small percentage of politicians quite clearly were corrupt. The knowledge of that existed, it filtered out and we were all tarnished. The result now is that there is a plague on all our houses. When I think of some of the comments that have been made at some of the tribunals regarding some of the activities, I remember the 1972 All-Ireland hurling final between Cork and Kilkenny commentated on by M&iacute;che&aacute;l O&rsquo;Hehir. It was a great game and, during the commentary, M&iacute;che&aacute;l said &ldquo;Whoever wrote the script, God bless him&rdquo;. If the late John B. Keane sat down to write a script about politicians and tribunals, he would not have been able to come up with some of the terminology from the tribunals that will go in folklore.</P>
    <P>One of the upsides of the tribunal is that hopefully we will get to the truth and the corrupt will be found out. I am not sure the tribunals will stop corruption and we will have to examine other mechanisms to address that. However, one of the downsides of the tribunals is that, if a politician promotes something progressive, people will ask who he represents or what he wants? Any progressive or positive view expressed immediately draws questions but a <Col N="814"/>different view is taken if somebody opposes something.</P>
    <P>People who are against something are often influenced by forces from the opposite end of the spectrum. Such forces often have a vested interest and do not want things to go ahead. People who refuse to zone land for some reason are every bit as guilty as those who zone it when they should not. These are the two ends of the spectrum and it is important to realise this.</P>
    <P>I do not want the country to evolve into one where it is a crime to make a shilling. By the same token, politicians have got to be above reproach. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, referred to the extension of the Criminal Assets Bureau, I think a Bill is in the pipeline. There is great potential to extend the CAB and determine how we can address this once and for all. Whether I am a Member of the House for one year or 20 years, I do not want to come in here every other year to hear of accusations against politicians or officials. It is time to address the problem in a proactive way.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to prove corruption. Many of those who have given evidence at the tribunals, whom the public perceive to have been wronged, are no angels. Due to a falling out or a belief that they have not benefited to the extent they wished, they decided to spill the beans, so to speak. People who have given corrupt payments to officials or politicians are party to the crime and, therefore, are unlikely to come forward to give evidence.</P>
    <P>The notion of amnesty is not well regarded in this country, but if I were the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I would examine some such measure. While it is difficult to be prescriptive, I would look at the possibility of giving an amnesty to people who come forward with information that results in the prosecution of a politician or official involved in corruption. While people have a right to know their accusers, I would examine the issue of anonymity for those providing information of this nature. If such information is given vexatiously then the accuser should be subject to a charge.</P>
    <P>Some seven or eight years ago I was naive enough to believe that, with the exception of one or two cases, corruption was virtually non-existent. I never believed for a moment that it existed to the extent that has since emerged, or that people in such high places were involved. I have become a little bit wiser. I believe others are involved in corruption, albeit on a lesser scale. Such people prey on vulnerable people who think they have to hand over something to get something.</P>
    <P>Corruption is not the domain of one or two political parties, it goes right across the board. Neither is it the practice of the vast majority of politicians across the political spectrum. We have to be proactive in addressing the issue. Politicians have to be above reproach, but we have to devise a mechanism which can root out corruption and <Col N="815"/>bring guilty politicians and officials to task. It should not be hanging over our heads to be thrown at politicians in every public meeting across the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not as long in the House as Deputy Timmins, but I am also under the impression that the days of corruption are probably past. I wonder if in future there will be tribunals into matters that are occurring today. It is something about which we worry and I hope there is no activity of that kind happening today. I hope the great legacy of the tribunals will be a change in the nature of politics and, to a lesser extent, business. I hope they will restore faith in the body politic generally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is a technical one in many ways. Deputy Perry created a slightly erroneous impression by suggesting that the intention of the original legislation was not to allow for one member of the tribunal to separate into other areas of inquiry. That was always the intention of the original Act and in this Bill it becomes much clearer and is placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have had much discussion on whether we should wait until the tribunals have an opportunity to investigate matters of topical interest. Calls have been made for parliamentary parties to carry out investigations, for individuals to produce evidence and for Oireachtas committees to undertake inquiries.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned all of these stand as mere star chambers compared to the efficiency and fairness of a tribunal, in not only protecting the names of those people against whom allegations have been made, but also ensuring that the truth is ultimately arrived at because of the powers they have been given by the House over the past number of years. Those powers include the compellability of witnesses and the ability to discover documents. It allows us to have arrived at a state of knowledge in 2004 which was not the position in 1997. It is a matter of public record that when the Taoiseach gave his views in the House on Ray Burke in 1997, he categorically supported his good name. However, people are now saying he should have known then what it has taken seven years of a High Court level of inquiry to discover, that he should have known what the Garda fraud bureau has discovered, and what the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda have unravelled in the past seven years. This will be the legacy of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>We accept it is the correct forum for the investigation of these matters for two reasons, namely, to find the truth and to protect the good name of people being investigated until such time as a finding of wrongdoing has been made.</P>
    <P>I wish to follow on from Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s comments about lawyers. I declare an interest in that I am a barrister. The explanatory memorandum gives an indication of the fashion for lawyer-bashing that exists today and probably <Col N="816"/>has done since the profession of lawyers came into being. Under the heading &ldquo;Purpose of Bill&rdquo;, it states: &ldquo;To avoid any ambiguity and out of an abundance of caution in the situation which has arisen&rdquo;, and so on. The term &ldquo;out of an abundance of caution&rdquo; is the kind of lofty sarcasm that is now commonplace in the way people refer to work done by lawyers.</P>
    <P>In general, what lawyers do is examine legislation in the High Court. From time to time they discover loopholes in legislation and in that way they keep the Oireachtas honest. As parliamentarians, we are forced to go back to the drawing board and to correct the problems that have been exposed. That is a valuable service to the Oireachtas. It would be meaningless to produce legislation that has been examined through five Stages in the House unless there was some way of examining or exposing its loopholes at a later stage in a court. It is lawyers who do that work and this should be recognised. In my short time in this House we have had to revisit the Domestic Violence Act because of a finding in court and more recently the Immigration Bill for the same reason. The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act also had to be revisited because of something that was challenged in a court of law. These are valuable services by lawyers in that regard.</P>
    <P>The question of payment to lawyers often arises. When an advertisement was placed seeking barristers to assist the Laffoy commission investigation into child abuse, not enough barristers could be found, in spite of the fact that they were offering &euro;800 per day or something of that nature, which is a great deal of money. The reason for this is that when one joins a commission or tribunal of inquiry one must suspend normal practice. The Bar Council did not defend itself enough on this issue. This would be similar to a GP closing down his or her practice for a period of a year and a half without a locum and then expecting to come back and find it in a healthy state. The reality is that if one closes down one&rsquo;s business and disappears to work on an inquiry, one will come back and have to start one&rsquo;s business all over again. That is why they were not able to find barristers to do that work. It is time that we dispelled some of the myths about what is going on. While I agree that there should be a tendering regime, I do not think it will improve the costs paid to barristers. Barristers will work on these tribunals as long as it is worth their while to do so. I do not think barristers have anything to fear from tendering. If anyone has anything to fear from it, it is the Attorney General. If it is a free market, he might find that he has to pay more than he pays currently.</P>
    <P>I have not spoken in this House on Mr. Justice Flood or the work he did in the five years prior to his retirement. I knew him because he was chairman of a school in which I taught. He was a great servant of the community in which he lived and has done a great service to the nation. The <Col N="817"/>work Mr. Justice Flood did at the tribunal during his period of chairmanship was efficient. Deputy Perry talked about it being financially worthwhile and continuing to be financially worthwhile. It has other legacies than a simple balance sheet of its costs versus what it has gained in terms of tax. Other benefits have accrued to the nation and, while these cannot be measured financially, they will be recorded in the history books.</P>
    <P>The first is the Criminal Assets Bureau. Although it relates to another period, it has worked well with the findings of the tribunal in recent years. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to expand the powers of the bureau in light of Supreme Court decisions over the past two years regarding its powers. I look forward to the time when the CAB can investigate trusts. This is one of the difficulties it has had hitherto in getting at cash corruptly collected by criminals.</P>
    <P>Another legacy of the tribunals will be the changes in electoral law, to which most public office holders are now subject. We have a raft of legislation in place that requires Members of the Oireachtas to provide details of any money we are given or spend. We must have separate bank accounts at election times and our election spending is limited. These changes are attributable to an extent to the work of the tribunal. This is not calculated in assessing whether tribunals have been worthwhile. Changes in ethics law are also attributable to an extent to the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The question of costs is always a vexed one. I am glad to see this clarified in the Bill. I regret the phraseology in the explanatory memorandum; it is dismissive and a little bit sarcastic in tone. While I may be interpreting its tone wrongly, that is that way I read it. I am glad to note that express provision has been given to the right of the chairperson to appoint other members to carry out separate divisions of the inquiry. I am sure we will deal with the problems and delays referred to by other speakers.</P>
    <P>It is invidious to compare this inquiry to the Hutton or Saville inquiries. Those inquiries were investigations into single instances. For example, the Saville inquiry inquired into the happenings over the course of a day in Derry. The Hutton inquiry inquired into a single event, namely, the death of a government official and how this arose. The Flood and Mahon tribunals are inquiring into a series of events that will require considerably more unravelling. The support the House can give by way of technical amending legislation must be welcomed. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and support the Bill. I always speak about where I come from and what I am doing here. I came from the grassroots and was elected to the D&aacute;il two years ago. I have had a great opportunity to see life and assess the problems at the coalface. As a medical practitioner in a rural area, I link with all the <Col N="818"/>people and share their joys and sorrows when I attend weddings and funerals. I decided to run for election as I could no longer cope with the frustration of trying to deal with issues in my surgery as a general practitioner. I saw the deficiencies in the service for people that needed to access hospital, either for acute or non-urgent treatment. I bore witness to the deprivation experienced by the people in my area.</P>
    <P>I speak about the issues that are important to my area on every chance I get. Last night, I spoke about decentralisation. I said that so much could have been done in the past that was not done. Half our graduates must go to Dublin to find their first job. Many of those who went to Dublin and are nearing retirement live in bedsits. They would have been so much happier in their home area and would have contributed to the area. The political parties did not do what they should have. Facilities and infrastructure that should exist do not. Decentralisation could have done so much.</P>
    <P>Now that the Celtic tiger economy has passed, we have so little in our area that should be there. Mayo is the most economically deprived area in Ireland. It could have been so different and we now know from the tribunals how it could have worked. We know how the political parties, especially Fianna F&aacute;il, worked. In the past, it would have been terrible to say in the D&aacute;il that Ministers were involved in corruption. However, this is the reality. Those Ministers were no advantage to the good name of the Fianna F&aacute;il party. This is the legacy we must all bear. This is the burden that Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers especially and the body politic must bear. It is a heavy cross on those who were not involved in corruption. There are good people in every party who were not a part of this and wish it had never happened. This is the affliction Fianna F&aacute;il must bear.</P>
    <P>The tribunals are supposed to address this and purge Fianna F&aacute;il of those of its members who are guilty of wrongdoing, yet there is a perception that the tribunals are not doing this. They are seen as a mechanism to shift responsibility from those who should face up to dealing with certain individuals as they should be dealt with. What does one do with rotten apples in a barrel? One gets rid of them. Fianna F&aacute;il should have done this to remove the contamination that affects the entire body politic.</P>
    <P>People also feel the tribunals are being used to drag out proceedings and that the delays in the administration of justice will mean those who should have liability will escape from it. Seven years have already passed and, under the Statute of Limitations, these people will be untouchable. This is the perception the public has and why it is so cynical. Were it not for this cynicism and the history of neglect, I would not have been elected in the style in which I was.</P>
    <P>Anything that will change this perception is to be welcomed and this is why I welcome the Bill. It sensibly states that there should be a facility for more than one judge to be appointed. If there is <Col N="819"/>more than one judge, they can deal with several modules simultaneously. This happened in Britain and was quickly sorted out.</P>
    <P>However, here it takes Methuselah&rsquo;s years to sort such things out. It would give the public confidence again if there were a concerted effort and Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats were seen to be doing what was necessary, getting the right number of judges involved. People would judge them on what happened from now on. We have many laws, but it is their application that will make the difference. Their proper application will ensure that people have confidence again, enabling them to trust the body politic. That trust is gone, and that is terrible. The body politic must regain that confidence, otherwise we will have lost the plot.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not rocket science, it is straightforward. It is certainly overdue, but I wonder how long it has taken for it to come about. It is obvious that there is a vested interest in dragging out the process. That exists from the point of view of wrongdoers, who would love to escape their legal liability, which would expire after the Statute of Limitations ran out. There is also a vested interest on the part of the political parties affected. They do not want all that dirty linen coming out, so the longer they can drag it out to avoid those issues, the better &mdash; out of sight, out of mind. Crooked Members have a better chance of escaping liability the longer the situation is left as it is. There is also a vested interest on the part of lawyers, since they are cleaning up.</P>
    <P>No matter what is said or done, we must get real. We need infrastructure in the west. We need roads and a western rail corridor. A well-meaning Minister came down to the west for the day, but he did not have the promised &euro;250 million in his pocket, though it was needed. When one thinks about the underspend of &euro;322 million in the BMW area for public transport projects or the fact that in the order of 157% of projected spending went on the south and east compared with 51% in the BMW area, one sees that it represents money that should be going to the west. It should be there to ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure for balanced regional development so that we can keep our people living locally and half our graduates need not go to Dublin for their first job. That is being perpetuated all the time.</P>
    <P>Those millions would have been better spent doing all those things &mdash; and might still be better spent. Let us stop that flow and try to deal with the situation. Give us the infrastructure that we need and a future. To do that, we need this money, but tribunals and a gravy train have been eating it up. There is a vested interest in ensuring that it goes on <i>ad perpetuum</i>, for ever and a day.</P>
    <P>I have great faith in tribunals and in what they can do. However, let us fast-track the situation with multiple judges. Let us make it all happen. The more judges we appoint, the quicker things <Col N="820"/>will happen. The Bill is logical, referring to the chairman or tribunal members being able to go to the High Court. That makes a great deal of horse sense. It is a very useful and sensible contingency which will thwart those who seek to frustrate the quest for justice. I support the Bill, but I am talking about action. We have had many words, but we need action.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to the D&aacute;il the first time around, I could not understand why I did not have speaking time. We had to form the Technical Group to get it. Now the public talks and the press makes a field day out of it, saying that Jerry Cowley spoke only so many times in the D&aacute;il. They cannot say that now, because we formed the Technical Group. The perception is that we can simply walk into the D&aacute;il and speak, but there must be speaking time. It is obvious that there is a vested interest controlled by political parties. Independents as such do not have speaking time of their own. Now people are seeing things differently. I would not have got elected &mdash; the first to be elected &mdash; if people were not so cynical and could not see that there is another way. The power is in their hands since they are now getting it back. A whole new era is coming as a result of all these shenanigans. I see the wonderful vista of a D&aacute;il not populated by political parties but by Independents.</P>
    <P>It is a very good point that if we had proper D&aacute;il procedures, with committees meeting every day or second day, and meaningful debate in the D&aacute;il, there would not be so much need for all these tribunals since the work would have been done. Everything would be in the open and there would be a chance for meaningful debate. I saw that today in the Joint Committee on Health and Children, where it was obvious that things were coming out that would not have done so without that facility. For instance, people sent away by health boards and the Government to train in orthodontics could, simply by paying back the money afterwards, get out of the public system altogether and go off into private practice, leaving us bereft of a planned service. Fifteen thousand children who should have received treatment did not get it.</P>
    <P>The authorities were able to continue to pour money into the national treatment purchase fund when it should have been going into supporting local services, rather than taking them away, as the Hanly report is attempting. That was done instead of building up services, getting rid of waiting lists and applying logic to matters. However, those points are not getting out because of the vested interests of so many to keep matters as they are. I can see another vista though. The legal profession is a powerful gravy train of vested interests. When all this pans out, if people escape liability under the Statute of Limitations, who will carry the can for that? Will the lawyers do it?</P>
    <P>There should be an insistence on expediency and sanctions. In any contract, there are penalty clauses and so on, yet to what builder would one <Col N="821"/>give a blank cheque to build as big a house as he wanted, taking as long as he wanted to do it? One would keep giving him the cheque book and tell him to write as many cheques as he wanted, since it would not be our money but that of the people. That is not at all acceptable and must change. In the real world of business, this would not happen, since there would be penalty clauses. To whom would one give a contract without penalty clauses? One would not give anyone a limitless contract and a blank cheque.</P>
    <P>We need more accountability in all this since it is our money and it should have been used to do other things. Had it been so used, I would not be here, I would be at home in my surgery. It should be used to prop up the failing health service, which needs investment. Talk of a black hole is a fiasco. There is no black hole because we are only now getting the money that we should have got over the years. However, money is going into things that it should not go into. There are 200,000 people who deserve medical cards but are not getting them, supposedly because there is no money. Money is going into this sort of thing instead.</P>
    <P>I say once again that I am not against tribunals. I am all for them, but there must be some sense and logic here. Much can be done. There are unemployed barristers going around looking for briefs, but the few barristers with the big private practices may be earning so much compared with what they would get from the State that they may not wish to return. However, that is no excuse for not having justice done and seen to be done. We need systems that allow people to have faith in the body politic again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the last speaker. However, I question one or two matters regarding his reference to the political parties not doing the work. Everyone should speak for themselves. The political parties did the work, but what could and should have been done outside was not done. Regarding speaking time in the House, I have been here for some years, and there have been Independents and various groups in it. There was always time for all groups to speak in the House. I never saw restrictions, and I would never countenance any. The real difficulty was to ensure that members of bigger parties got an opportunity to speak in the House. Many of the regulations that have crept into the House in recent years exclude many of the members of my party and other bigger ones from speaking. I wish to set the record straight on that.</P>
    <P>I will deal with this specific tribunal in a moment. However, the issue of tribunals goes back a long way. In my time in this House, we have had inquiries and tribunals. We had the Kerry babies tribunal and one on a sea tragedy off the coast of Cork. There were several others. A tribunal or inquiry is called for where there are questions which have not been answered <Col N="822"/>adequately through the existing system. It illustrates a breakdown in the investigative authorities, the police in other words, or a lack of adequate powers to do the job.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>While the beef tribunal sat for a long time, it seems relatively short in comparison to the current inquiries. One can draw one or two conclusions from the tribunal&rsquo;s results. It was deemed to be extremely expensive. On the other hand, the DIRT inquiry investigated a much longer period of activity than any other inquiry. It prepared itself well, investigated a 20 year period in six months, did a fine job and came to conclusions at very little cost. The benefit to the Exchequer was great with the most recent tally of recovered funds standing at almost &euro;1 billion. None of those involved was a highly paid lawyer, which is not to reflect on the legal profession. The inquiry was carried out by ordinary Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who were doing their work in the ordinary way. Pitted against them were some of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds, but they did not flinch even in the face of several attempts to unseat the inquiry. The job was done effectively through the political system and broadcast to the people on camera every day. The cost to the Exchequer of the inquiry was £980,000. The inquiry can be favourably compared to any within or outside this jurisdiction in terms of its cost effectiveness and its ability to reach conclusions.</P>
    <P>I reject in its entirety the suggestion that only a particular group can carry out such inquiries in future. The reason we have so many tribunals sitting at present is that normal procedures were not observed in the first place. People did not obey the law and, for some reason, law enforcers were unable to get to the kernels of these matters and deal with them adequately. This is not intended to be a poor reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea. For a long time, a contempt-breeding familiarity with the law has been growing here. It springs from a daily recognition of the trappings of ill-gotten gains visible throughout the country. Every day, we see headlines which report shootings at the mansions of criminals known to the Garda. The public sees that these palatial mansions have swimming pools and other trappings and asks how it can happen so easily.</P>
    <P>Why is it so easy for a criminal gang to seek the help of the Garda when one of its members goes missing? I acknowledge that we are all entitled to equal access to the law. These well-known professional criminals seek sun havens all over the world and are depicted as living it up and enjoying good business relationships with their colleagues in crime through worldwide networks. What else do they need? We say that something should be done and that is where we should start. There should be no circumstances in which a criminal, hardened or otherwise, can buy and sell property, acquire holiday homes all over the place and live on the ill-gotten gains of crime. <Col N="823"/>If the public has erred, it may well be as a result of looking at some of what has gone on around it.</P>
    <P>The tribunals were necessary as we had to do something about these matters. Many public figures suffered as a result. I am sure many people hoped everyone but them would be involved, but that is not how it happened. I cannot understand how a public relations specialist was able to carry a bag of money around to public representatives in positions of some authority and ask them how much they required to do the jobs they were supposed to be doing anyway. How did we arrive at circumstances in which that could happen? Why was this person not arrested in the first instance? Why did we allow circumstances to develop in which this person could come to this House and offer a bonus to Members who had been tasked with a statutory function? Why was nothing done about the people who authorised this behaviour? I cannot understand it. We have all dealt with planning regulations and permissions over the years. While the case of a person seeking planning permission may or may not be valid, once a financial inducement is introduced its merits become irrelevant. The case is automatically invalidated.</P>
    <P>The last speaker reminded me of another tendency in our society and it prompts me to ask what branch of society has remained unscathed through the current spate of inquiries into wrongdoing. Politicians come immediately to the fore as the original culprits. I looked recently at a passport application form and noted that it required the applicant to obtain an endorsing signature from a person in authority. It set out a list of those from whom the endorsement could have been obtained previously and a list of those from whom it can be obtained now. Members of the Oireachtas are no longer regarded as authoritative signatories in this regard and I am uncertain as to the status of peace commissioners. The interesting list includes those who are entitled to sign. A member of the clergy is obviously unscathed by everything that has happened in the past 20 years, as are teachers. Garda&iacute; are unscathed. A bank manager or assistant bank manager is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Definitely unscathed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last, but by no means least, the list includes medical doctors. I do not suggest that all the odium which has fallen on the heads of Members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives was undeserved. All the odium should not necessarily fall on them, because others in society also erred. I am not suggesting for a moment that the members of all those <Col N="824"/>professions should bear the burden, because they were not all responsible. The same applies to politicians. The word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; is usually used by the Government to spread the word into the wider masses and suggest that all politicians are supposedly suffering from the same malady. I say that for the benefit of those who tend to suggest from outside the House that all politicians are crooked and that they can prove it. Society needs to look at itself as well. I am not trying to justify or countenance the wrongdoings that have occurred, but we should know that society tends to ignore certain things when it wants to.</P>
    <P>All that brings us back to the type of inquiry we are talking about, the cost of it and the modules. Everyone now talks about the cost of the inquiries. What also concerns people is the length of time they take to reach conclusions. If there is a need to set up an inquiry in the first place, which there has been, a conclusion must be reached using all necessary resources. Everything must be done to ensure there is no repetition, and that the same kind of circumstances do not recur with similar any consequences. We cannot have that.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the modules operate. The Minister of State may have different views on this, but there seems to be some confusion between tribunals of inquiry and courts of law. In a tribunal, a year can pass between an allegation and a rebuttal. That does not happen in a court of law. I know also of situations where those who defend themselves in an inquiry seem to presume the same rules and regulations apply as in a court of law, and for everybody&rsquo;s sake that needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that the DIRT inquiry was a difficult job, done under much pressure. I say this not because I was a member, but because members of all political parties were involved. People outside the inquiry know little of the work done, but the inquiry was effectively carried out. There was no question of it dragging on. We knew it could not. It had to be dealt with within a specific timeframe, because it was not possible for ordinary parliamentary life to continue at the same time. That urgency was there all the time. Those who wanted to cross-examine got their opportunity too. They did not have to wait for three or six months to rebut an allegation. I cannot understand why the tribunals cannot do something similar, nor why it is not possible to reach conclusions much quicker, and accelerate the entire business. I know the judges and the tribunals might say I should mind my own business. Maybe I should, but this is what the public pays me for, this is what we are in this House for, and as long as we are here, that is what we will do.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful if the modules were looked at again with a view to finding out whether an accused might have an earlier opportunity of coming forward, and that a particular segment of the inquiry be put to bed, as it were, rather than dragging on.</P><Col N="825"/>
    <P>I am intrigued when I hear the dramatisation of the tribunal inquiries on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; radio show. What amazes me is the modulated tone of the legal eagles, wherein they ask questions which are obviously loaded and ominous.</P>

	<P>The reply from the unfortunate accused, whoever he or she may be, is: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The barristers ask a couple of other modulated questions, and each response from the unfortunate accused becomes more and more shrill. This indicates a school for lawyers. Is the Minister of State teaching them? Has he perhaps taught some of these people?</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>

	<P>The accent used by Deputy Durkan was Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s accent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is on a lighter note. In this case we recognise that in order to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion, it is necessary to pass this legislation which hopefully will allow the judge and subsequent judges to reach conclusions and to set costs in respect of the period prior to their being on a particular inquiry.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Andrews said, there is something which we need to be careful of in this House. We live in a time when everything seems to be compartmentalised, regulated with set pieces, arguments for and against, ten minutes on one side and ten minutes on the other, whatever the case may be. The Immigration Act was struck down in the courts in recent times, and one of the causes cited was the lack of adequate debate in the House. We must look at that issue and recognise that the job of the House is to debate legislation. That is our first job, and our statutory responsibility. We are supposed to express our views on every Bill that comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Someone recently said to me that we need to be briefed but that is not the case. We are supposed to be able to speak as we think, as elected public representatives, giving our own opinions, enlightened or otherwise. We are not here to be briefed by someone who might suggest to us a particular view of a matter. We must examine in our own way. We need more research and back-up facilities, but it is vitally important that we recognise the need to express our own unadulterated views on the legislation coming before us &mdash; nothing more and nothing less. Of course we may sometimes be wrong. So are lots of other people, including our good friends the judges, who get things wrong from time to time. Nobody has a monopoly on infallibility. We should not worry about that. We should be happy to express our views in our own way, and if people do not like it, that is tough.</P><Col N="826"/>

	<P>I support the legislation. I hope we will not have a visit from the courts to tell us we were too rash in our response or that we did not adequately discuss this legislation. We have discussed it adequately at this stage, and understand it adequately. While the rash of tribunals will undoubtedly continue for some considerable time, let there be a lesson in this for society and for Parliament. By operating the rules and regulations that are there, by using the investigative abilities of Parliament to do its job, let us try to ensure there is no repetition. I am not criticising the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who is sitting opposite and who is not the worst in terms of responding. However, when almost any question is asked in the House, an issue arises as to whether we should have the information. As the Minister of State knows well, it is the duty of Members of the House to ask the question and the duty of the Minister to whom it is directed to answer it. Failure to do that will ensure the necessity for more tribunals which will cost billions of euro.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the work the tribunals are doing and I welcome this legislation. It is important that the tribunal judges are immediately given whatever powers are required. I pay tribute to the former Mr. Justice Flood for the tremendous work he did and for his commitment and that of his staff. It is time to take stock of where these tribunals are going, and this legislation is timely in that regard. Obviously it makes much more sense to give the tribunals extra powers than not give them.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this country&rsquo;s planning process has been proven to be corrupt at all levels, from Taoisigh, to Ministers down to councillors, and this House has not responded adequately to that problem. It responded by setting up tribunals and giving them resources and in the context of legislation governing Members&rsquo; interests and declarations of money received or whatever, but the one area needing urgent reform is the planning process, particularly in the context of rezoning questions, which is the root of this problem. Rezoning is at the root of all the corruption I read about in the newspapers, including the rezoning of Carrickmines and of vast tracts of land in north County Dublin. It is about Ministers being gifted with houses they did not pay for and the nod and the wink, which is disgraceful. We have not dealt with that problem adequately but we must deal with it now. The Government must deal with this issue and bring in new legislation to examine how the planning process must change as a result of what is going on.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues said he does not disbelieve that the tribunals will go on for years <Col N="827"/>and cost millions of euro. They will if we do not change the core of the process. The biggest problem is that when rezoning issues arise, and we must rezone because towns change and there are areas of growth and decay, there is no change in the interaction among councillors, public representatives and planners. Planning is supposed to be a quasi-judicial process. It is as if it were a court of law and from the planning point of view all sides must be looked at fairly and the arguments must be balanced, but what is the reality?</P>
    <P>The reality in the rezoning that is taking place is that the people knocking on the doors of county councillors throughout the country, as the development plans are being prepared, are not residents&rsquo; associations but landowners and developers. One county councillor in County Louth described to me an event that occurred in his house before the development plan was voted on. He said it was like spaghetti junction outside his door for a weekend, with developer after developer and landowner after landowner coming to him to make their case. That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>If developers and landowners &mdash; this is where the change is needed &mdash; have points of view which are important to them, the planning process should be ring-fenced from the elected representatives and the planners. One should be able to make one&rsquo;s case through the relevant local authority, be it county council or urban district council, directly in writing and if the council requests that one should attend to make the case personally, if one felt so aggrieved about the issue. I would not have a problem with that, but the corruption occurs in the personal contact between the two sides of the argument. That must change. It is shameful that this system has continued for so long and that we have refused to change that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Durkan, who said the vast majority of politicians are honest, decent people. Of course they are but there is corruption in politics and if we can make this change in our planning process fewer public representatives will appear before tribunals and there will be better debates in our council chambers. From reading the transcripts of the evidence given to the tribunal, one can see that the debate is about the landowner&rsquo;s interest when the land is being rezoned, what the landowner and the developer wants, not what the community should have.</P>
    <P>When development plans are drawn up the developer sometimes has the plan even before the councillors. Councillors do not have plans which are prepared by county councillors. I was in a businessman&rsquo;s office one day talking about an issue when he produced a copy of a development plan for the county council of which I was a member but which I had not seen. I asked him where he had got it and he said it was widely circulated and that everybody had it, yet as an <Col N="828"/>elected member of that council I did not have a copy of the plan. I contacted the county council but it said it could not explain how the plan got out, but it did get out. That was shameful. I could not lay the blame on anybody, and I do not do so now, other than to say that plan leaked like a sieve and the last people to know about it were the public representatives who are charged with deciding on the plan. That is what needs to change. That problem is at the core of the tribunals, the greedy, grubby, grasping hand that is reaching into people&rsquo;s pockets to get something from which one can benefit, and the public interest is lost sight of. We have a planning process that is not working. There is corruption in that process and we must sort it out immediately.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this debate, we cannot continue to ignore the fact that the cause of corruption is the physical contact between landowners and developers and public representatives. If a quasi-judicial function is taking place and a planning development is being made, it should be an offence to personally approach public representatives in their homes or lobby them in any way. The day of the spaghetti junction outside county councillors&rsquo; homes must end now.</P>
    <P>To take the parallel of the courts, nobody goes knocking on the judge&rsquo;s door when a case is coming up in court. Nobody knocks on the juror&rsquo;s door saying, &ldquo;My case is coming up on Monday, my argument is this, what can you do for me?&rdquo; but the jurors in the planning process are the elected members. That door knocking is going on and until it stops, we will always have these tribunals. The Government must address that fundamental issue because it is destroying the credibility of the political process. It is a reality.</P>
    <P>If one talks to young people about politics, as we all do, they say it is corrupt. They refer to the tribunals and they say we are all the same. We all hear this day in, day out. Young people, and many others, believe that, and that is the reason they do not engage in the political process because it has been proven to be corrupt in the tribunals. Let us get our act together. We have not addressed this issue and in that regard we have failed the public. This is where the change must be made.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate. As I said at the outset, this is a short technical Bill which deals with a very important issue. I especially appreciated the comments of those who had regard to that fact.</P>
    <P>The tribunals of inquiry legislation dates back over 80 years. In the interim it has been amended substantively five times. This Bill is the sixth amendment. In general, all the amending measures were occasioned by some specific need that emerged from the experience of sitting tribunals, tribunals which had just concluded their work or the anticipated needs of tribunals about <Col N="829"/>to be set up. This is also the case with this Bill which has been inspired by the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood as chairperson of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. This Bill, as in the case of amending legislation since 1979, adds to the efficiency and effectiveness of the tribunals system as it stands. On this occasion we are providing certainty with regard to the authority of the chairperson of a tribunal to make a determination on an application for costs in a situation where he or she had not originally heard the evidence and where the chairperson must have regard to a previous report of the tribunal. We have also provided for two very effective mechanisms to assist tribunals, namely, for the tribunal to seek the direction of the High Court and also for tribunals, where there is more than one member, to sit in separate divisions to allow for more efficient and speedy consideration of the matters concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of points, some of which I will respond to briefly. Deputy Connaughton asked the fundamental purpose of the legislation and why there was a need to set it up in the first place. The fundamental issue is that there was some uncertainty as to whether, when a tribunal is sitting and the chairman resigns or is replaced, his or her successor can determine costs, even though he or she has not been physically present to hear the evidence in respect of which he or she is determining costs. The fundamental purpose of this legislation is that we wanted to put that beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy expressed the view that Judge Mahon should refuse costs to people who obstructed or at least did not co-operate with the tribunal. I do not want to anticipate what Judge Mahon decides. There are findings to show that certain parties did not co-operate with the tribunal and some actively obstructed the tribunal. Judge Mahon has the right to make his own decision on costs. Deputy Deasy asked also if the Attorney General was personally involved in the drafting of the legislation and if we are satisfied that it is watertight. I confirm that the Attorney General cleared this legislation and all the advice available to us is that it is watertight. We have made every effort to ensure it is watertight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan said that when an allegation is made against a person in a tribunal it takes a long time for him or her to get the opportunity to reply, unlike when an allegation is made about a person in court. The reason is that in court cases, there is usually a net issue and there are usually just two parties. Even in a criminal case, there is the prosecution and the defence; in civil cases there are usually two parties. By its nature, a tribunal of inquiry will involve many parties. There will be many people who have to give evidence. How quickly one gets a reply to an allegation made against one will depend on how many others are being questioned. Deputy Durkan is correct. This is a fundamental <Col N="830"/>weakness in the tribunals system. That a serious allegation can be left hanging over a person for an indefinite period is a serious lacuna in the tribunals system and one which the Law Reform Commission will be addressing in its current examination of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello said the public was getting fed up because of the spin emanating from spin doctors, Government spokespersons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially those in Limerick.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and with tribunals. There is spin and reality. The reality is that people genuinely are getting fed up of the tribunals. They say they are taking too long and are costing the earth. They are asking if they will ever come to an end. They are asking the questions Deputy McGuinness asked, namely, whether the money could be put to better use in building hospitals, providing radiotherapy units and so on. What permeated this debate from start to finish was the cost of the tribunals and the length of time they are taking. The Government is moving on both those fronts.</P>
    <P>On the issue of procedure, the Commissions of Investigation Bill, which we expect to revisit before the end of this session, provides not necessarily an alternative to tribunals, but something that will stand side by side with tribunals and will often serve as a precursor to a full tribunal hearing &mdash; an effective and speedy mechanism to gather evidence where that does not need to be done by the full tribunal. Sometimes all that will be needed for a particular investigation is that new model which is envisaged by the commissions of investigations legislation. That will help the position not only in terms of time but in terms of costs because if it takes less time and can be done more efficiently, obviously it will cost less.</P>
    <P>On the specific questions of costs and tribunals, it is envisaged that tribunals as we know them will continue to exist side by side with commissions of inquiry. The Law Reform Commission has been asked to direct its attention to this and is doing so. Its final report is expected towards the end of the year. It will look at the structures of full-blown tribunals, how to control costs and so on, and how to proceed more efficiently and more quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finian McGrath suggested we look at other models, such as Germany. Reference has been made to the Hutton inquiry in the United Kingdom which proceeded much more expeditiously, even though some have expressed unhappiness at the ultimate outcome. There is a fundamental difference between Germany and Britain. There are very fundamental differences between Germany and this country. Whatever is in the written constitution in Germany, it is different from our Constitution. Germany does not have to contend with Supreme Court decisions, such as the Jock Haughey decision, where people were given the right to protect their <Col N="831"/>characters and to cross-examine their accusers on any allegations made against them. Tribunals and courts must operate within the parameters of that decision. Ireland is a common law country, Germany has a civil law tradition which is a completely different set up. The same applies to a lesser extent in Britain. Britain is also a common law country but it does not have a written constitution and the constraints imposed by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>People have referred to the success of the DIRT inquiry conducted by a committee of this House. I agree with everything that has been said in that regard. I agree with Deputy Costello that it was unfortunate that we came up against the courts in the Abbeylara case, which was a manslaughter case. There is room for much greater involvement by parliamentary committees in these matters. That is an issue the Law Reform Commission will consider seriously, particularly in view of the success of the DIRT inquiry.</P>
    <P>I understand some of the Opposition parties intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage. I put Members on notice that the Government will accept all reasonable amendments.</P>

   <Title>An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring the Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. This Bill was initiated in the Seanad on 17 December 2003 and completed all Stages in that House on 4 February 2004.</P><Col N="832"/>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the amalgamation of Bord Glas with Bord Bia. The food and horticulture, including amenity horticulture, industries are operating in an increasingly competitive environment at home and overseas. They need to focus on efficiencies, competitiveness and market orientation to make the most of sales opportunities. My aim is to assist the industry in addressing these challenges. Looking ahead, a single agency can carry greater weight in the delivery of services than a structure where separate bodies are responsible for promoting home and export markets for horticulture.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of Bord Glas, carried out in 1998, considered that a proposal to amalgamate Bord Glas with Bord Bia should be reviewed within five years. Given the economic importance of the food and horticultural industries to the economy, I believe that an amalgamation is now opportune and can bring together the synergies necessary to promote and market the entire food and horticultural industries at home and abroad. The horticultural industry will also have access to the broader profile of Bord Bia&rsquo;s existing international network, with the possibility of establishing a complementary international branding for the amenity sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill consists of three parts: Part 1, preliminary and general; Part 2, dissolution of Bord Glas; and Part 3, amendment of the Principal Act, the An Bord Bia Acts 1994 to 1996. Parts 1 and 2 contain the usual provisions regarding legal interpretation, transfer of staff, property, liabilities and preparation of final accounts. Part 2 also provides that Bord Glas will be dissolved as and from a transfer day to be made by order, from which day the staff and functions will be transferred to Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Part 3 provides for the transfer of the current functions of Bord Glas in their entirety to Bord Bia. This in essence means that the current function with regard to assisting production of horticulture will remain. A comprehensive definition of the word &ldquo;horticulture&rdquo; to include amenity horticulture and production is provided. Bord Bia already has the marketing function for edible horticulture on overseas markets.</P>
    <P>I propose that no fewer than two people with knowledge or experience of horticulture will be appointed as ordinary members of the board. No increase in the overall numbers on the main board is proposed. I also propose to update the nominating function of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to suppress the nominating function of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as seafood marketing has not transferred to Bord Bia to date. The facility to effect such a transfer under section 9(2) of the Act remains in place.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill, my Department consulted the chief executives of the two organisations and the board of Bord Glas. In addition, 34 <Col N="833"/>organisations representative of the horticulture sector, including institutions, were asked to submit their views. The Bill covers the main areas of concern expressed on the issues of representation on the board, the establishment of a dedicated horticulture subsidiary board and the inclusion of the amenity sector.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the outcome of the consultation process, I am providing in the Bill for a sub-board for horticulture, comprising 12 ordinary members and a chair who will be a member of the main board. The horticulture sub-board will have a legal identity under the An Bord Bia Act in the same way as the meat and livestock sub-board at present.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for powers by way of regulation to modernise the system of levy payment on live exports from the current pre-paid stamps system. Any regulation proposed under this provision will be laid before the Houses in the normal way. Provision is also made for the establishment of subsidiary companies by Bord Bia for the purposes of complying with legal requirements for internationally recognised quality assurance.</P>
    <P>The legislation is relatively simple. The interests of concerned stakeholders &mdash; staff and the entire horticulture sector, including amenity &mdash; are adequately safeguarded within the proposed new, strengthened organisation. The Bill will ensure that promotion actions at home and abroad are synchronised to achieve the best possible service for the producer and taxpayer alike and I commend it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>This simple and short Bill, as the Minister described it, is in marked contrast to the fanfare with which the then Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, launched Bord Bia in 1989 or 1990. I deeply regret that the Government has decided to scrap Bord Glas, which is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill to establish Bord Glas as an independent statutory body in 1990, the then Minister stated that the Government believed that the much needed development of our horticultural industry could be achieved only if responsibility for its development was put in the hands of a body with specific overall responsibility to carry out the task. When one winds forward the clock, one discovers that certain cutbacks had to be made because of the Government&rsquo;s spending mania in the years leading up to the previous general election. When the so-called three wise men set their eyes on the Department of Agriculture and Food, the wheel stopped spinning when it reached Teagasc and Bord Glas. The result is this Bill for which the catalyst was the need to cut costs. Irrespective of the general arguments of properly managing the public finances, however, one should always be slow to target development research and market intelligence.</P>
    <P>At the time of its introduction, the Fine Gael Party opposed the Bill for a number of reasons <Col N="834"/>but many of its concerns were addressed on Committee Stage by the then Minister. At the conclusion of Report Stage, the former Deputy Farrelly stated he was happy with the assurances given by the Minister to consult industry. Nevertheless, many of the issues raised by Members then still hold true.</P>
    <P>With concerns about healthy eating and competition in the horticultural industry on the increase, the decision to incorporate Bord Glas into the larger Bord Bia is a retrograde step. Considerable concern has been expressed to me about the dangers of the smaller agency being subsumed in the larger body and losing its identity. Bord Glas and other small agencies such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara have a definite, concentrated and recognisable role which may be lost.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to relocate Bord Bia and Bord Glas, with their staff of some 75 people, to Enniscorthy. Given that 20 of these posts are based overseas, will the Minister explain the precise position? Speaking on budget day, the Minister for Finance announced the transfer of some 75 members of the staff of Bord Bia to Enniscorthy, yet I am given to understand that 55 of them are located here, with a further 20 based overseas.</P>
    <P>The founding principle of Bord Glas was to maximise the contribution of horticulture to the economy, the environment and the health and well-being of our citizens by ensuring the availability of quality produce and services from the horticulture sector. One of the main objectives was to promote increased consumption, which is now more important than ever in light of the current widespread debate on our eating habits, especially among the young.</P>
    <P>Medical opinion suggests that obesity among children could reach epidemic proportions within the next ten years due to our sedentary lifestyle and eating habits. To receive a cabbage or turnip in one&rsquo;s Christmas stocking is depicted as punishment rather than reward. According to the Food Safety Promotion Board, obesity levels increased by 67% between 1990 and 2000 and more than 20% of men and 16% of women are now obese.</P>
    <P>Television advertising aimed at children has played a major role in this trend. Each year in the United States, for example, the food industry spends an estimated $10 billion to influence children&rsquo;s eating behaviour. The average American child watches 10,000 food advertisements per annum, 95% of which are for fast food, soft drinks, confectionery and sugared cereals. More than 100 obese children are being treated at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin for growth, diabetes and endocrinology disorders. While recent research by the Department of Health and Children indicates that adults are increasing their consumption of fruit and vegetables, since 1998, reported fruit consumption has declined sharply &mdash; by almost half &mdash; among schoolchildren and vegetable <Col N="835"/>consumption has also declined, although not at the same rate.</P>
    <P>Health promotion may not be a function of the board, but increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables is within its remit. It must be frustrating, therefore, to have to compete with McDonald&rsquo;s and similar companies. I hope funding will always be allocated to promote healthy consumption.</P>
    <P>Consumers spent &euro;801 million on fresh fruit, vegetables and potatoes last year, second only to dairy produce. A further &euro;1.1 billion was spent on the procurement of these products in the food service industry. On the non-food side of horticulture, consumers spent &euro;431 million on plants and cut flowers for the home and garden products. This indigenous industry employs approximately 18,500 people across the food and non-food areas and employment is spread across the country.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to learn from Bord Bia at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food yesterday that our edible horticulture exports decreased by 3% last year, although it is possible some of this decline is due to currency differences. Bord Glas monitors the retail value of the fresh produce market through the Taylor Nelson Sofres household panel in the Republic which involves continuously tracking the spend of a representative sample of 1,350 households. The consumption figure of &euro;801 million in 2002 consists of &euro;310 million for fresh vegetables, &euro;161 million for potatoes and &euro;330 million for fruit and berries.</P>
    <P>Despite our pride in the horticulture industry, a visit to any supermarket or shop provides evidence of the large quantity of such products we import, including cabbage from the Netherlands, carrots from Spain and potatoes from Israel and France. The market share of Irish vegetable production is declining even though consumption of vegetables is increasing due in the main to the increased intake by adults. Irish imports of fruit and vegetables in 2002 were to the value of &euro;613 million, an increase of 9% over 2001. The Irish mushroom sector has fallen back in recent years and its value decreased by &euro;11 million in 2002 to &euro;117 million.</P>
    <P>An article published in <i>The Irish Examiner</i> at the end of January reported that a local Cork producer experienced difficulties because he was a long distance from the market. It stated that the industry was in the hands of a small group of growers who were tied in with the big multiples and it was difficult for other growers to break in. It was proposed that if the other growers co-operated their bargaining power would be enhanced. I believe this was tried in east Cork but they ran into difficulties a few years ago and went out of business. Growers experience difficulties with transport costs.</P>
    <P>There are many challenges for the horticulture industry. Due to diversification many mainstream farmers may seek to enter this sector. In an <Col N="836"/>enlarged EU change will be required. There will be more competition but there will also be a more accessible market. Labour shortage difficulties in such a labour-intensive industry should be easier to overcome from next May but it is likely there will be a reduction in Structural Funds available for investment in the industry over the coming years. For obvious demographic reasons, many tillage areas are in close proximity to large areas of population and the increasing demand for housing will eat into this supply. There will be a departure of experienced growers and their associated expertise.</P>
    <P>Our microwave lifestyle does not sit easily with fresh produce and a more radical taste among young people has given rise to a string of Thai, Indian and Chinese outlets and products. There are Indian restaurants in places as diverse as Bunbeg and Cross Bridge<b>. </b> In the past we were used to the chipper and breast of chicken meals but now most nooks and crannies have these foreign, so-called exotic restaurants.</P>
    <P>With increased participation in the workforce, preparation time for meals is limited. Pre-packed and prepared vegetables are becoming more popular. Bord Glas should have been expanded to meet these challenges. Food safety is rarely an issue with fruit and vegetables so price is the main factor. It is difficult for the organic sector to expand at a great rate. Many areas require assistance and advice.</P>
    <P>This Bill is straightforward and the Minister has outlined the relevant sections. It subsumes Bord Glas into Bord Bia. Section 4 deals with the staff transfer. The concept of decentralisation is to be welcomed. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith tried to relocate the Civil Defence on one occasion. There was a staff of 30 in the Dublin headquarters but only one person agreed to relocate to Roscrea. The staff of both Bord Bia and Bord Glas are experts and I question how decentralisation will operate. I sought to raise the matter at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food but I was ruled out of order by the Chairman because the committee was dealing with marketing issues. I wonder how the relocation to Enniscorthy will impact on the marketing ability or otherwise of Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill deal with administrative matters and the composition and appointment of the board. Section 14 allows for the establishment of subsidiary companies. I ask the Minister to elaborate on this provision in his response or on Committee Stage. I am uncertain whether this means that it deals with specialised assurance schemes or a marketing body for specific aspects such as the organic sector or the administration of a quality control scheme.</P>
    <P>The amenities sector faces a greater threat of neglect than the edible sector. I ask the Minister to review this issue on a regular basis. Horticulture also includes the garden centre sector which is countrywide. In my constituency there is a garden centre called Rathwood which is <Col N="837"/>very successful. As people have more disposable income they will buy items such as flowers and bedding plants.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity for expansion in garden products. Ongoing investment is required in the industry and modulation funds may have a role to play. I ask the Minister to consider encouraging farmers to diversify into certain aspects of horticulture. The modulation fund will be the Minister for Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s version of the slush fund of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. I am confident the Minister will use the fund in a more responsible manner than was the case with the CL&Aacute;R programme.</P>
    <P>Producers should consolidate and grow to order for key buyers. They must provide themselves with the option of the weekend farm markets. Local authorities should facilitate this development. Many people like to visit the local farm market and more are setting up. It gives the farmer an opportunity to compete against the regular retailers. Transport efficiency is vital to the survival of growers located at a distance from population centres. There is a real battle against imported products. Consumers should not be deceived by the glossy chilled product on the shelves.</P>
    <P>I was among a group of Members who participated in a recent promotion by Bord Glas. We were asked to purchase food products and I endeavoured to buy Irish products only. Out of a total expenditure of &euro;14 my expenditure on non-Irish produce was approximately &euro;9 and that was mainly vegetables. There is much deceptive advertising of products in shops and consumers may believe they are buying an Irish product when they are not doing so. As Deputy Upton will know, I won the healthy buying competition but like most politicians I have unhealthy eating habits.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, it seems there is an attempt to subsume everything into Bord Bia but there is only one representative of Bord Bia in the United States, based in Chicago. That seems unusual to my mind. Perhaps the thinking is that the individual companies should do their own promotion work and only one link person is required in the American market. I suggest that the drinks sector should be represented.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that 34 organisations were asked for their views. He may not be able to provide the information today but I ask him to inform me of the response he received from them. The genesis of this Bill was in the cutbacks in the 2002 Estimates. The cutbacks were necessary as a result of the spending mania and the over-expenditure by Government in past years. It is now more important than ever to have a promotion body for the edible and amenity sectors of horticulture. This is particularly in view of the fact that in 2002 imports were to the value of approximately &euro;600 million. It is surprising that we are importing so much foreign produce.</P><Col N="838"/>
    <P>The promotional work of Bord Glas is excellent but it has a staff of only 11 or 12 people. That body should have been expanded rather than contracted. There is an increasing realisation of the need for healthy eating. As is the case with crime, preventative measures should be put in place to assist health by encouraging people to eat healthily. We should not think that the cabbage or the turnip is a punishment food.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Fine Gael recently carried out a survey on the issue of the farm gate price of products. For example, the farmer is paid 40 cent for a head of cabbage, there is a mark-up of 233% and the consumer pays &euro;1.29. He is paid 20 cent per kilo for potatoes and they are sold at 90 cent per kilo which is a mark-up of 350%. He is paid 47 cent for a cauliflower and it costs &euro;1.19 in the supermarket. We have continual difficulties with the farm gate price. Farmers need to work together to re-examine this matter. I do not know why the co-operative in Cork, with which Deputy Dennehy may be familiar, did not succeed. The option of a farm market or some other outlet should be open to farmers. People like to buy fresh goods, rather than being deceived by the chilled products which are imported by food stores. I realise that it is not legal for Bord Glas or Bord Bia strictly to market Irish produce, as opposed to imported products, at home.</P>
    <P>When one examines the contributions to the debate that took place when Bord Glas was being established, one will be reminded that it emerged from a commitment in a Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto in the late 1980s. It was a good idea, on reflection, to establish Bord Glas and I regret that it is being abolished. It seems that the Government intends to proceed with its abolition. I realise that the Minister is arguing that it is not being abolished, but merged with another entity. We all know, however, that the larger organisation swallows up the smaller one during a merger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister does not try to take similar measures in respect of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and other organisations. We will oppose this Bill because issues other than consumer issues are involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill. I do not agree with the thrust of the Bill, which is to amalgamate Bord Glas with Bord Bia. The two boards have fundamentally different roles and functions and should be retained as two distinct units. There is a risk that the smaller board, Bord Glas, will be subsumed or gobbled up by the larger organisation. This may not happen deliberately but the nature of mergers is that the smaller body loses its identity. There is a real danger that the performance of the smaller organisation will not improve. The entity that emerges from a merger is not always greater than the sum of its parts. Many business <Col N="839"/>mergers have failed in the past and we should take account of the consequences of mergers for the smaller unit.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the two boards was not driven by a concern for food production or marketing, but by the recommendation of the three wise men whose job it was to find savings in the 2002 budget. It is clear that the financial gain from the amalgamation of the boards is extremely small in the overall context. I will ask the Minister at a later stage to quantify the gain and to outline the justification for the merger, if it is being pursued for financial reasons only. If there are concerns about savings among the food agencies, the Minister should answer questions about other food promotion agencies and boards within his remit. Why has Bord Glas been selected for special attention? There may be much more significant savings if the Minister considers the amalgamation of all the State agencies that have a role in food promotion. What part can be played by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the food wing of Enterprise Ireland or the Irish Dairy Board? I will return to this issue later in my speech. Is this merely a cosmetic exercise? Are the Minister and his Department trying to make small savings so that they will be seen to be doing something to keep the bookkeepers happy, rather than examining the real issues of marketing, promotion and sustaining the food industry?</P>
    <P>Bord Bia and Bord Glas have done a good job. Deputy Timmins mentioned that Bord Bia made a good presentation to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food yesterday. I compliment the clear provision of information in the presentation. Bord Glas is also doing a very good job in its area. The primary goal of each of the boards is quite separate and distinct &mdash; one is primarily concerned with production and the other is primarily concerned with marketing, which happens to be the marketing of food.</P>
    <P>Bord Glas has an important role in the production of horticultural products, including amenity horticultural products. It faces significant challenges in responding to changing consumer demands and in facing greater competition from exotic imported fruits and vegetables. If one takes a trip around one&rsquo;s local supermarket, one will clearly see the evidence of such competition in the form of interesting and exotic fruits. Such goods cannot be produced in Ireland for a variety of reasons, particularly the climate. We have to face this element of competition and to examine how we can address it. The decision to diminish the ability of Bord Glas to provide a competitive effect does not represent the best approach.</P>
    <P>The lifestyle of the consumer has changed significantly in recent years. Consumers are looking for meals that are produced as convenience foods. The health aspects of our diet and lifestyle have changed. The emphasis on healthy eating represents a real challenge for the food industry. Bord Glas should have a particular <Col N="840"/>niche in that regard. Fruit and vegetables have been identified as a major part of a healthy diet. A major concern in the amalgamation of the two boards should be to ensure that the role and importance of fruit and vegetable production is not diluted in any way.</P>
    <P>We must continue to respond to the challenge of adding value to the commodities. This applies not only to fruit and vegetables but also to other commodities. The basic commodities in the horticulture sector &mdash; fruit and vegetables &mdash; will be challenged as commercial ventures if we do not support the adding of value to commodities. I am aware that this matter has been discussed in other fora, but it is important that we persist with the debate. I am concerned that Bord Glas could have played an important role in that regard. We should enhance its role and create more opportunities for it.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing emphasis on the importance of fruit and vegetables in our diet. The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has been quite proactive in emphasising the importance of consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables every day. The significance of the role of fruit and vegetables in our diet was emphasised recently when the UK Government decided to provide vouchers for the purchase of fruit and vegetables by those in lower socio-economic groups. The authorities there are placing particular emphasis on developing an awareness of the importance of fruit and vegetables, particularly fruit, in the diets of children. The obesity debate is here to stay because the problem, which is found in all western countries, will not go away. We can help to alleviate or address it by placing emphasis on the consumption of fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>The use of technology and infrastructure in the horticulture industry has increased tremendously in recent years. It is being used to assist the production of high-quality raw products, particularly mushrooms. The horticultural commodity that Ireland is best at producing for the export market is the mushroom. It dominates most of our vegetable export markets. Bord Bia made clear to the joint committee yesterday that a real threat to our mushroom industry is presented by cheaper imports from countries such as Holland and Poland. We have to acknowledge that there are real problems in this regard. This Bill&rsquo;s dilution of the role and responsibility of Bord Glas, which was put in place to assist the production of fruit and vegetables, is not a good way to go about enhancing our ability to compete with imports from other countries.</P>
    <P>Bord Glas risks losing its distinctive identity if the proposed amalgamation with the larger body goes ahead. It has carved out a distinctive and important niche in the horticulture industry, but there is a risk that it will be diluted and subsumed in the larger body. The establishment of a sub-board is important and welcome. However, it will be a smaller player in a much bigger field and the <Col N="841"/>niche role of Bord Glas will be lost again. It is important that membership of the board will adequately represent the values and interests of the horticulture industry and will not be mere token appointees.</P>
    <P>I emphasise to the Minister the importance of ensuring gender balance in the formation of the board. This is an opportunity to ensure that the gender balance will be adequately addressed. It should not simply be a case of women&rsquo;s groups with an interest in the horticultural industry putting names forward. It is the Minister&rsquo;s remit and responsibility to be proactive in ensuring that the gender balance is established. I have raised this point in other matters with the Minister recently.</P>
    <P>Tremendous strides have been made in the amenity horticulture area with a rise in the levels of employment. Emphasis is being placed on the training and education for that particular aspect of the industry. I again emphasise the importance of the appointment of a board member who would be sympathetic to the role of the amenity horticulture input of Bord Glas. The amenity aspect of horticulture is one that cannot be forgotten. The emphasis has been on the fruit and vegetable sector. However, when it comes to marketing and promotion, the amenity horticulture aspect will not gel in the wider Bord Bia environment. This aspect will be diluted in the larger board where the marketing of the food aspect will become predominant.</P>
    <P>In his speech to the Seanad, the Minister referred to the cost savings from the amalgamation. It will be just a cosmetic exercise as the savings will be small in the overall budgetary scale. I am not aware of any quantification of the savings that will arise from the amalgamation. If the basis of the amalgamation is one of finances, then it is important that the savings are quantified. Merging of market research, logos. quality assurance schemes and promotional operations at various exhibitions throughout Europe and Ireland may have an associated cost saving. However, I want to see it quantified. I could agree with the Minister&rsquo;s rationale if he proposed the merger on the basis of improved market access, improved quality and increased value added to the products, but as a method of balancing the budget, it will have little impact. Other factors will be taken on board. However, it appears that finances are the primary driving force behind this amalgamation.</P>
    <P>If all the virtues the Minister referred to are inherent in the change, why is Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the food element of Enterprise Ireland not also part of the merger? I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s references to the good job done by Enterprise Ireland in various sectors. The Minister also made the point that if one is setting up a poultry industry, one does not go to the Department of Agriculture and Food but to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am building my case for a <Col N="842"/>separate Department with responsibility for food. Enterprise Ireland is doing a good job, but the plethora of resources diffused around the various Departments should be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent co-ordination of the labelling of foods under one banner because it brings order and clarity to the system. On the one hand, there is a will to bring together all the labelling issues under one banner. I can see the rationale of bringing together all the boards and State organisations that have a role in the establishment and promotion of food operations. However, this is not what is happening in the proposed amalgamation of Bord Glas and Bord Bia. There are shades of labelling confusion developing when one looks at the various bodies and organisations with responsibility for food. Many of them are being left as stand-alone enterprises. If there is a rationale behind co-ordinating and amalgamating those food agencies and boards, Bord Glas and Bord Bia are not the ones to start with, as there must be a more co-ordinated approach. Until the rationale has been set out for the amalgamation and co-ordination of all these agencies, Bord Glas is in an invidious position as a token operation.</P>
    <P>In October, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources publicly denied that there were plans to trim down BIM. With regard to concerns expressed about the amalgamation of BIM with Bord Bia, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">We want to make sure that we have proper synergy for the money we have, and spend it a bit more wisely. But nothing will happen until I am absolutely satisfied that it makes sense, and I have seen nothing to date that would suggest to me that anything should change.</P>
    <P FLI="0">However, in November the Minister had a slightly different slant on the future of BIM. He refused to rule out any initiatives that could improve the State&rsquo;s performance in the area of marketing and promotion of Irish seafood. Mr. Hugh Byrne, chairman of BIM, and a former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, said that marketing fish was a specialised skill and involved a different language and approach to that taken with other food products.</P>
    <P>The same argument can be applied to Bord Glas. I am arguing in favour of retaining the unique nature and characteristics of a horticulture board in the same way as fish marketing is seen to be unique. It seems, however, from later comments of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that there are other plans. Is it not reasonable that all these should be addressed together rather than in a piecemeal fashion? While there is a case for the rationalisation and amalgamation of some of the various bodies that have grown up around the food business in Ireland, more significant questions remain to be addressed before the amalgamation of Bord Glas and Bord Bia can be justified. For these reasons, I will oppose the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>In principle, there is nothing wrong with amalgamating bodies which are involved in the same broad area. There are merits to bringing the overall development and marketing of horticultural produce under one body. However, I have concerns, as do other Members who expressed them in the Seanad and elsewhere, that this proposal might diminish rather than enhance the work previously done by Bord Glas. There is also the question of resources.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is an area that requires increased investment in both research and marketing, and I trust this will occur under the new arrangement. I use the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; because, unfortunately, the recent experience of cuts in Teagasc indicate that there is not the required will to develop research facilities. So-called rationalisation and streamlining can be another excuse to divert resources away from areas that require development. The importance of the research department in Teagasc is paramount to the development of its aims.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is an area of crucial importance where substantial progress can be made in supplying the needs of consumers and the processing industry and boosting the level of exports. Up to October 2003, almost &euro;518 million worth of vegetables and fruit were imported, while only &euro;187 million were exported. While the level of imports remained almost at the same level as in 2002, exports had fallen in value by &euro;9 million. It is noticeable that a small proportion of horticultural exports go to non-EU member states and this was reduced by half in 2003 to a value of just &euro;2.3 million. The marketing side must be promoted to enhance that development and reverse the decline. That is an area where improvement can be made and I hope the new body will devote its energies to enhancing the strength of the sector.</P>
    <P>Sinn F&eacute;in was among the first to argue in favour of decoupling as part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. One reason was our belief that the single farm payment would provide an opportunity for Irish farmers to move into different areas of production with the security of the guaranteed payment. Farmers would do well to examine horticulture as a lucrative area in which to become involved. It offers potentially high productivity and can bring more added value. Now that farmers no longer depend on having to produce in order to draw down subsidies and premia, it is an attractive area. This will require a substantial commitment of research and marketing resources which I hope the new body will deliver. This applies particularly to the small and medium-sized farmer who has effectively become part-time dependent on the premia and payments drawn <Col N="844"/>down. This would give him or her the opportunity to return to a more full-time commitment.</P>
    <P>Farmers should also prioritise the organic sector where there is strong potential for producing high quality products that are in great demand in external markets. This country is ideally situated to become a site of excellence for the production of organic food which would build upon and enhance its image as the source of high quality produce. Many farmers will recall when perhaps 30 or 40 years ago much of the produce, particularly in the west, the south-west and isolated areas, was effectively organic. I grew up beside the sea and our vegetables were grown with seaweed and natural dung. Many of my age group would have this memory. However, that image can be maintained only if we retain our current high standards. It is also important to realise that from a health and safety point of view Irish produce throughout Europe and farther afield is highly recognised as being the best on the market. Our shortcoming is a failure to market our produce properly.</P>
    <P>This image will be possible only if we continue to refuse to allow the cultivation of genetically modified crops. There are plans to end the EU embargo on genetically modified maize and there is a danger that it is only a matter of time before the Commission succumbs to pressure from the United States and the large corporations to allow the production of GM crops. That would represent a serious setback for Irish agriculture and negate the good work being done by Bord Glas and Bord Bia to sell our food abroad. It is essential that we proactively address our credibility abroad and the fact that the food we produce is so safe. The introduction of GM crops can only harm that reputation and must be resisted.</P>
    <P>There are several issues to be addressed in the wording of the Bill, and I hope to do so in the form of suggested amendments on Committee Stage. One of these concerns the issue of the type of people who will be members of the new board. For example, in Part 3, section 18 (<i>a</i>) it is proposed that &ldquo;Not less than 2 of the persons appointed to be ordinary members shall be persons having knowledge or experience of horticulture&rdquo;. It might also be stipulated that at least one member ought to have some knowledge or experience of organic production techniques that would provide a co-ordinated approach to this work. Also in section 18 there is a reference to board members having knowledge of the food industry or horticulture and consumer requirements. It ought also to be stipulated that members should be fully conversant with the ongoing debate on the scientific and economic arguments surrounding GM. It is essential that we have an informed opinion for the future.</P>
    <P>I am slightly unhappy with the vague commitment to gender balance and believe this ought to be stipulated at 40%. However, we can return to these issues on Committee Stage to which I look forward.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party opposes this Bill, not alone on the selfish grounds of putting out of existence a body which officially is translated as the Horticultural Board but also more literally as the Green Board. The idea of abolishing a body established relatively recently to encourage, maintain and develop an industry that has always been the Cinderella of agriculture makes no sense. The Minister of State&rsquo;s argument about possible synergies does not convince. There was a need to establish Bord Glas and there is a need to maintain it. Deputy Upton&rsquo;s arguments in response to the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument about the need to create an all-embracing food body do not hold true when put against other sectors of the food industry such as the fishing industry and the food elements of Enterprise Ireland. On each of these grounds the Minister of State and the Government have failed to convince. They are making a grave mistake in seeking to put Bord Glas out of existence rather than seeking to enhance it.</P>
    <P>Historically, we have over-depended on an agricultural system that relied too heavily on animal by-products when we had the land resources that would have facilitated a more widespread and diverse system of agriculture. There has never been a greater opportunity to develop such a system in these more developed and prosperous times but unfortunately the Government is taking us down another road. It should promote diversity and high quality produce because food can be produced in large quantities around the globe. This might not always be the right type or amount of food for those who need it but that is another issue in terms of world hunger and poverty.</P>
    <P>We have significant advantages in how we produce food that we choose not to exploit. Our environment is still of a relatively high quality, yet our food promotion agencies exist only to market food. Bord Bia is a marketing body but its remit should cover education and challenging policies that are ultimately contradictory. For example, there is a proposal to locate a national toxic waste incinerator in my constituency. The national food agency should be able to question decisions of this nature. If other processes compromise the quality of food we produce, it should be in order for a State agency to challenge Government policy in this area. Instead, it follows a very narrow remit to market food excessive quantities of which may already exist on the world market.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is trying to marry two bodies, one which has the ability to develop into a high quality, high quantity producer in areas which we have previously failed to develop, with a food agency model that is trying to market food that is unsaleable because there is too much of it already in the world market. This is a marriage that should never happen. It should be referred to the Government&rsquo;s marriage advisory service because these are not compatible partners. It does not make any sense in terms of future <Col N="846"/>agricultural policy to put together what in chronological terms could be the maid of 20 with the man of 70. We have seen how such marriages have affected the population of rural communities. There is the opportunity and the development in Bord Glas. However, Bord Bia must reconstitute, ask what it is about and where it is going because in world agricultural terms it does not offer the same potential as horticulture. The Government seems to be introducing this Bill only in terms of cost savings. I am not sure where this body will be located in the Government&rsquo;s relocation programme.</P>

     <Quest>the steps he is taking to address adult literacy problems; the position with regard to the implementation of workplace basic education programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The adult literacy service is organised by and delivered through the VEC adult literacy schemes throughout the country. The service is resourced and managed by the VECs through funding from my Department. Since the publication of a report of an international adult literacy survey in 1997, my Department has invested considerably increased funding in the development of adult literacy services.</P>
    <P>The annual number of clients of the general adult literacy services provided by the VECs is currently 28,000. The additional funds provided in recent years were used to expand the scale and scope of provision, improve outreach and referral links and promote flexibility and quality. In addition to expanding the general adult literacy services, specially targeted programmes have been introduced for people with special literacy requirements in such areas as family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs and catering for those for whom English is not the mother tongue. To try to reach as many people with literacy needs as possible, use is made of radio and television so that people can access help in the privacy of their own homes.</P>
    <P>The national development plan committed &euro;93.5 million to the service in the period from 2000 to 2006, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients over that period. In the area of workplace literacy, joint initiatives have been developed at local level through co-operation between VECs, F&Aacute;S, the National Adult Literacy Agency and local employers. Specific funding has been <Col N="847"/>provided for a course in workplace basic skills training for experienced group literacy tutors. This course is designed to familiarise literacy tutors with the key issues in basic skills training in the workplace and also identifies strategies for introducing and implementing programmes in this context. Programmes under way at national level include the return to education programme, a joint initiative between F&Aacute;S, VECs and NALA, which provides an intensive literacy programme for community employment workers on F&Aacute;S community employment schemes. A focused workplace literacy programme is available nationwide for local authority outdoor staff. There are also successful workplace literacy programmes in two hospitals and in a trade union.</P>
    <P>The commitment and support of employers is a fundamental requirement for the successful implementation of workplace literacy programmes. In seeking to support and encourage employers to participate in such programmes, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a project proposal from NALA to design and deliver a workplace basic education programme for SMEs. A pilot programme for the development of a certificate in workplace skills has also been approved by that Department under the ESF aided in-company training measure of the human resources development operational programme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Much work has been done and progress has been made in this area. The Minister of State mentioned the projects in local authorities, which are successful. However, I am concerned about the roll-out to the private sector, which I appreciate could be more difficult. Does the Minister of State agree that part of the difficulty is the absence of statutory support and that staff training programmes, which are already in place in the private sector, seem to assume that participants have basic literacy skills, which is not always the case? How will NALA&rsquo;s workplace basic education strategy, which features in Sustaining Progress, be progressed through the partnership process? What steps is the Department taking to progress the roll-out of the workplace basic education programmes in the private sector and has a timescale been set? Will the Department establish a workplace basic education fund? The Minister referred to two schemes in her reply. Has her Department been in contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the possible use of the training budget for the workplace basic education programme? I know the Minister of State cannot answer for that Department, but that budget has not been spent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for her questions and I welcome her acknowledgement that much work has been done and funding has <Col N="848"/>been made available for adult literacy. That was a priority of the last Administration and of this one. There has been an 18-fold increase in the level of funding provided by the two Governments since 1997. While we recognise the tremendous work which needs to be done, much work has already been done and that is obvious from the increased take-up of the service. NALA is doing a great job in the roll-out of that service.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged by people involved in the literacy programmes and in surveys which have been done that workplace literacy is one of the important elements of trying to eradicate illiteracy. To do that, we must ensure that people take up the programmes. However, that depends on employers. There is a specific reference in Sustaining Progress to the workplace learning programme. NALA has trained a number of tutors to provide literacy in the workplace and has promoted the availability of services among employer organisations. There are also successful workplace literacy programmes in two hospitals and a trade union, as I said in my initial reply. Paragraph 2.8 of Sustaining Progress, which the Deputy mentioned, states that workplace basic education literacy, numeracy and information and communications technology programmes will be implemented, building on the recommendations made by NALA, which is the agency with specific responsibility in this area.</P>

     <Quest>his views on the publication of the third interim report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse; the steps he intends to take to ensure that the commission receives the appropriate level of co-operation from his Department in light of the view expressed in the report that the committee was not satisfied that, since its establishment, it had received the level of co-operation from his Department to which it was entitled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5365/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse for the completion of its detailed third interim report. I welcome the report and I am pleased that it provides at least some closure and confirmation of their experiences for the former pupils of the Baltimore Fisheries School. I remind everyone that the valuable work the commission has completed in respect of Baltimore was one of the main purposes for which the commission was established, that is, to inquire into the abuse that occurred in these institutions and to report on it. This was the Government&rsquo;s intention at the time the commission was being established and continues to inform the manner in which the Government is dealing with this issue today.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to the manner in which my Department dealt with the commission, both as a sponsor and a respondent, and I will deal <Col N="849"/>with each of these issues in turn. Since the commission&rsquo;s inception, my Department has responded to its requests for resources as quickly as possible. As with all other Departments, this Department must and did submit each request for resources to the Department of Finance and-or the Government for consideration. The Department has been and will continue to be committed to supporting the commission.</P>
    <P>The resourcing delays which the commission referred to in its report primarily relate to the period from June 2002 onwards when the commission sought a doubling of its resources, particularly its personnel. I previously explained that it was necessary that this request be considered by the Government, following which it was decided that a review of the operation of the investigation committee was necessary. This review has been justified and I am confident that the legislation which will emanate from this review will assist the commission in completing its remit in a timely fashion. Furthermore, Judge Ryan in his report on the working of the commission, which was undertaken prior to his being appointed chairperson of the commission, recommended that an <i>ad hoc</i> group of senior officials be identified who could deal with resourcing issues as quickly as possible. The Government has accepted this suggestion. I am confident that this process will ensure that all future requests for resources are dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>In its role as respondent, my Department at all stages made every effort to co-operate with and assist the work of the investigation committee of the commission. In this regard, the Department voluntarily handed over to the commission more than 500,000 pages of documentation between 2000 and 2002. Furthermore, by June 2003 it had provided the commission with approximately 1,900 statements relating to cases before the investigation committee. In addition, it responded to 16 discovery directions that were issued to it.</P>
    <P>I have already accepted that there were some difficulties encountered, especially in complying with a small number of the discovery directions. However, in this regard, the commission&rsquo;s third interim report acknowledges, &ldquo;some of the difficulties were caused, or contributed to by the Committee in that for example there was not sufficient clarity in the direction as to what was sought, or insufficient time was being allowed for compliance.&rdquo;</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the Department&rsquo;s processes are above reproach, last December I ordered an independent review of the process and procedures for the making of discovery by the Department to the commission. I appointed the former chairperson of the Bar Council of England and Wales, Mr. Matthias Kelly QC, to conduct this review. In addition to being completely independent of my Department, Mr. Kelly has considerable experience of sexual abuse <Col N="850"/>litigation and is co-author of an article entitled &ldquo;Child Abuse in Residential Homes&rdquo; in the <i>New Law Journal</i>.</P>
<P>Mr. Kelly conducted his review over a two-week period that commenced on 5 January 2004. In the course of conducting his review Mr. Kelly met officials in the Department involved in the discovery process and the legal team representing the Department. He also had access to all of the Department&rsquo;s records. I understand that Mr. Kelly also met representatives of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
    <P>The process of meeting with and interviewing persons relevant to his review has concluded and Mr. Kelly has very recently provided me with an interim report of his review. He has stated that he had originally expected that his report could be completed within a matter of weeks but that given the sheer volume of documentation, it is not possible and he will report in full as soon as possible. I would add however that, in his interim report, Mr. Kelly has reached the provisional conclusion that, &ldquo;the difficulties over discovery were not due to obstruction or concealment but rather due to poor historic record storage systems and misunderstandings as to what in fact was required.&rdquo; Mr. Kelly also outlines a number of interim measures, which I will be happy to implement pending receipt of his full report.</P></Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Has the Minister engaged with his Department given the unprecedented criticism of the chairperson of the commission when she said that the committee is not satisfied that since its establishment it has received the level of co-operation which it is entitled to receive from the Department of State which is its statutory sponsor? This is a very serious criticism to be levelled by the chairperson of the commission at a Department. Has the Minister engaged with that rather than simply justifying the actions of the Department?</P>
    <P>Following an extension, the discovery documents are now required by 28 February. Will those documents be supplied to the commission by that date? I hope the Minister shares the sense of urgency given that these people are getting older and waiting to have their cases heard by the commission. In this context, has the Minister given consideration to holding parallel hearings as proposed by Ms Justice Laffoy and Judge Ryan? This morning we debated legislation allowing tribunals of inquiry to conduct parallel hearings. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is just as important in terms of resourcing. Has the judgment on the Christian Brothers case been approved? Are we now into the 21 day period for appeal?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl11-?><Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the final point, we are into the 21 day period for appeal. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office has been informed that the Christian Brothers intend to appeal. However, I do not believe they have lodged papers yet. The <Col N="851"/>Deputy is right in saying that Ms Justice Laffoy suggested that parallel hearings might represent a way forward and on this basis she requested a doubling of personnel. However, Judge Ryan outlined a quite different view in his report. He feels that some injustice could be done by having different people hear the cases in distinct units.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he not suggest one-member committees?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>He did that, but not in the same sense as Ms Justice Laffoy. The Government has indicated that it will support the recommendations of Judge Ryan, who is now chairperson of the commission, in how he wants to go about his business. It is up to him to decide the best and most effective way, consistent with bringing closure as quickly as possible. I share the sense of urgency of all the victims who have suffered abuse in the past in getting closure and completion. Even with the proposal for extra resources I was not satisfied that it would shorten the timeframe of ten to 11 years of the commission. As that was not satisfactory to me, I ordered the review.</P>

The board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services for children, families and schools. The board&rsquo;s authorised staffing complement is 84. It has recently advertised a competition to fill 15 vacancies. When these vacancies are filled the staff composition will be as follows: 11 head office staff and 65 educational welfare staff supported by eight clerical support staff.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a <Col N="852"/>school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers, to be very important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the full. I consider it essential that the board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with its authorised personnel and with the help of other personnel involved in the area. When this has been achieved, I will consider the position again taking into account the available resources.</P>
    <P>The duties of the educational welfare officer include: fostering an appreciation of the value of education; advising schools and parents on school attendance issues and on strategies to promote regular school attendance; dealing with poor attendance or early school leaving case referrals from schools using a welfare-orientated approach; and initiating legal proceedings under the Act, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The duties of the home-school-community liaison co-ordinator include developing processes for active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of the children and visiting parents&rsquo; homes. School attendance issues and learning needs are commonly discussed during these visits. Their duties also include developing parents as prime educators, enabling them to support their children&rsquo;s learning and addressing, through a local committee, school-related issues in the community which impinge on attendance and learning. There is significant scope for integrated working between educational welfare officers and home-school-community liaison co-ordinators and discussions between the NEWB and officials of my Department are continuing with a view to finalising protocols for this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Act requires the principal of a recognised school to inform an educational welfare officer in writing where a pupil is absent from school for more than 20 days or where he or she is of the view that a student is not attending school regularly.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>This covers cases in which a student under the age of 16 drops out of school entirely and the NEWB has put procedures in place to classify all such cases as urgent and prioritise them accordingly. Arrangements are also in place in the areas covered by my Department&rsquo;s school completion programme to target children under 16 who have dropped out of school for particular support, with the aim of ensuring their earliest possible return to full-time education. I am <Col N="853"/>satisfied that these procedures address the issue of responsibility for children who drop out of school early.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the substantial criticism of the Government over early intervention for school leavers? This is having a knock-on effect on those such as the 17 year old boy before the courts yesterday, for whom, fortunately, a place was again found in Ballydowd. Is the Minister aware that an independent report states that the full implementation of the Education (Welfare) Act requires a complement of 360 staff? Even if the Minister feels this is not required, there is a big difference between 360 and the 99 that will shortly be in place.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the comments of his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who said: &rdquo;Remember, for several decades now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not entitled to quote during Question Time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>He alluded to the fact that for several decades we had a system in operation in many schools, whereby liaison between the home and the school exists. However, they have not been able to get all the children to attend school because in some impossible cases there is no co-operation forthcoming from the child or parents. While I agree with the Minister of State wholeheartedly, would the Minister not agree this means that the educational welfare officers, who have the power to take legal proceedings, are needed more than ever to ensure children do not end up in prison later on? If the staff is not increased from 85 to 360 as soon as possible, it would be like giving a junior hurling team drumsticks to take on Kilkenny &mdash; they would make considerable noise but would not get a result. While money has been thrown at the system since 1997, would the Minister agree we also need a coherent strategy and to staff the areas needed given the statutory right for educational welfare officers to promote attendance and take legal proceedings where the necessary?</P>

	<P>Meath men know nothing about hurling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The report referred to by the Deputy was not an independent one. It was commissioned by the National Educational Welfare Board and based on a brief with which I would not fully agree. It did not take into account the numbers of people in other areas of the education system who have a duty and obligation, as I mentioned, to look after children and ensure they attend school. I accept that home-school liaison officers, visiting teachers and so on do not have the ultimate statutory sanction of legislation. They cannot take legal action against the parents <Col N="854"/>of a child who is not attending school. However, the Deputy will agree &mdash; it is no great secret &mdash; that the National Educational Welfare Board is most reluctant to go as far as prosecution. It would prefer to take a more welfare-based approach initially, with which I agree.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the report to which the Deputy is referring took into account the wonderful work being done under the school completion programme by the home-school-community liaison officers and visiting teachers and considered in more detail how they might all co-operate with each other. If this happened we could have a far superior system. That is what we are trying to achieve.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the number of primary and secondary schools offering the social, personal and health education syllabus; the number of schools in which the course is being implemented in full; if there are planned additions to the content of the course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5418/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Social, personal and health education has been part of the national curriculum in all primary schools since September 2003. It is delivered to children at all levels from infants upwards. The content of the SPHE curriculum for primary schools was developed as part of the revised primary curriculum introduced in 1999. It provides opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child and help the child to create and maintain supportive relations and become an active, responsible citizen.</P>
    <P>All post-primary schools were required to implement SPHE as part of the junior cycle core curriculum from September 2003. The 2003-04 return of pupil information from 743 post-primary schools indicates that all post-primary schools are complying with this requirement. The content of the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle in post-primary schools builds on the new SPHE curriculum for primary schools. Its content is comprehensive and it is presented in ten modules which address topics and issues relevant to the lives of the students. An SPHE curriculum is being developed for senior cycle at present by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. Consultation on the proposed content of this new curriculum took place last autumn. It is planned that relationship and sexuality education will be fully integrated into the new senior cycle SPHE curriculum when it is completed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the SPHE programme is to be extended to the senior cycle. The Minister said that the 2003-04 return of pupil information from post-primary schools indicated that all 743 are implementing the programme. Is there a similar survey for primary schools and, if <Col N="855"/>not, will one be undertaken? Will the Minister confirm that the programme is being implemented at each stage of primary school and each stage of the junior cycle in secondary school? Has the Minister taken steps to investigate whether each of the ten modules at junior cycle level is being given the required attention?</P>
    <P>The Minister states that all primary schools are implementing the programme. Is he happy that each school is implementing it properly? There was a reluctance to implement the Stay Safe programme in a small minority of schools. Is the Minister satisfied that the SPHE programme is not facing difficulties of this kind?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing negative has been brought to my attention about the implementation of the ten modules of the programme. The system has been in place in the primary school curriculum for some time and as far as I know there has been no problem with any aspect of implementation at that level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be referring to the senior cycle. The provision for social and personal development for students at senior cycle varies. It tends to be influenced by factors such as the culture and ethos of the school and the curriculum offered. There is no standard approach to implementation of the programme at this level. Some schools use workshops and seminars at certain periods during the senior cycle. In some cases schools have an integrated, cross-curricular approach. Some schools also teach social and personal education as a discrete subject, even if it is only taught once a week or once a month. Within transition year there is a variety of practices. While I have had no reports of problems at primary level or junior cycle, the situation is much more varied at senior cycle level.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned there would be a review of the implementation of the programme at senior cycle level. When is this likely to be done? The idea of different schools following different approaches is a good one, once they cover the same ground. Will this remain the case at this level?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to anticipate what the NCCA will decide, but there is some merit, as the Deputy says, in having a flexible approach at senior level. I presume that will continue, but I cannot say what the recommendation of the NCCA will be. Consultation on the new curriculum took place last autumn so I expect we will hear something by the middle of this year, although I have no specific date.</P>

     <asker>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the number of <Col N="856"/>applications for resource teachers and special needs assistant resources awaiting a decision within his Department; the steps he is taking to address the backlog and to provide the supports needed by children with special needs in a timely manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5366/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Applications for special needs resources received between 15 February 2003 and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children who were starting school last September. All these new entrant cases were responded to and we continue to respond to emergency applications.</P>
    <P>The processing of applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this process completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special needs provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of special needs provision.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Arrangements for processing applications received since September 2003 will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. In this context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome. However, the basic purpose of the review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs. Pending the conclusion of discussions with the representative interests, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the pressures on that section of the Department. Deputy Enright and I met its officials late last year. Can I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that applications between 15 February and 31 August 2003 have been dealt with and reviewed in the Department? Are they ready to be sent to the schools or are they being delayed for some reason? The Minister will be aware of the concern of parents awaiting special needs resources for young children given that early intervention is so crucial. If the decisions have been made in the Department and the review is complete, can the <Col N="857"/>Minister not simply give the sanction and allow those children to get the resources they need?</P>
    <P>I have a copy of circular 24/03. Are applications after 31 August being delayed until the discussions with interested parties about the weighted system have been completed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is generally correct. Individual applications from between 15 February and 31 August have effectively been processed in the Department at this stage. However, there is a second part of the process which is still being carried on, that is, the assessment of the resources available to the schools concerned. We conducted an audit of the provisions available to schools at the end of last year. The results of this are being processed in the Department. The second half of the picture, therefore, is to see where resources are needed within the system. We accept that the individuals may have a need but we must now establish whether the resources are already in the school and if the need can be dealt with from within the school&rsquo;s current resources.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I refer to circular 24/03. To put it bluntly, the system we had in operation in the past only added more resources with little reference to what might have gone through the system. There was a situation where special needs assistants and resource teaching hours were available within the system but the children for whom they were made available had passed out of the school and the resources were never checked again. We are now trying to match the resources within the school to the needs of the young people who have applied to the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to applications after September 2003, we are in discussions about a weighted system with various groups and interested parties. This would mean that we could automatically provide the resources for schools from the start of the school year. The schools would be as aware of the resources they will have as they are of the number of teachers they will have and will be able to cater for the special needs automatically, particularly the less severe special needs. The schools would know from September how many resource hours, resource teachers and so forth they will have. We are anxious to finalise those discussions because there is no point appointing people and then removing them from the system again.</P>

     <asker>Mr. McCormack</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>his views on the cost of insurance for primary and secondary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5212/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and secondary schools, which are privately owned. It would not be reasonable to expect the State to meet the full insurance costs of privately owned buildings.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants which afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I also hold the view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of primary and secondary schools might encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State, that is, the taxpayer, would meet the cost. Such an approach would also reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks.</P>
    <P>I am committed to improving the funding position of primary and secondary schools in the light of available resources. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of primary and secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. In the case of primary schools the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57 in 1997 to &euro;121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that, by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now <Col N="859"/>receives extra annual funding of up to &euro;108,000 per annum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I should have done my homework and brought the figures on how much schools&rsquo; insurance has increased since 1997 as well. I do not disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the capitation grant but schools have little flexibility when faced with rising insurance costs. One school is spending &euro;60,000 which is a doubling of its insurance premium in just one year. Does the Minister have proposals to deal with this issue? The T&aacute;naiste has responsibility for dealing with insurance costs but the schools are the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility. Has he approached the insurance companies about this or looked at a possible scheme which a number of schools could use?</P>
    <P>It is unfair to say that schools would not concentrate on reducing risks if the Department paid their insurance. I doubt that any school principal wishes to have unnecessary risks in his or her school. Does the Minister agree that the capitation grant, given what it has to be used for in addition to the cost of insurance, leaves no money available to schools to reduce those risks where they occur?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Every school tries to reduce risk as much as possible, but there would be no incentive to do so if the Department were to meet all the costs. The increase in insurance premia for the period 1998 to 2002 was 70% while the capitation grant increased by 113%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of them doubled last year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Figures available in the Department indicate that the average increase last year in the cost of insurance premia in the secondary sector was 10%. There have been variations in individual schools where there were difficulties because of incidents and so forth, but the general increase is 10%.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether we had made any contact with insurance companies etc. Not many companies quote for this business, or perhaps they are not asked to quote. Most of the business is done by Allianz. We have been in contact with the company about insurance premia and got a lot of information on the issue. We tried, in so far as we could, to get it to ensure the levels of increase were not exorbitant. We got as much information as we could in our effort to assist schools as much as possible in the area of insurance. The company is also running a business.</P>
    <P>Whether it is primary or second level schools &mdash; I think it is second level &mdash; in fairness to the company, it operates and charges its premia on a portfolio basis. Except in rare exceptions where a school has had a number of incidents or claims, it treats all schools the same based on a <i>per capita</i> basis. This is how it arrives at its premia. It is a <Col N="860"/>little like the community charge in the VHI, there is a balance and a check. The insurers try to respond to schools in as fair a manner as possible. I would love to see insurance premia being reduced. The T&aacute;naiste is engaged in trying to achieve this on a wider front. I am assured by the insurance companies that the average level of increase was about 10% last year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is aware, I raised the issue of insurance within the constituency on a wider basis some time ago. He said that between 1998 and 2002 capitation grants increased by 113% while the cost of insurance increased by 70%. He must be aware that capitation grants needed to be increased by 113% because the amount available to schools to cater for the work such as that we read about in the newspapers every week falls far short of what is needed. Given that the cost of insurance has risen well beyond the rate of inflation, the increase in capitation grants should be significantly higher unless the Minister can work with the T&aacute;naiste to come up with some scheme which will enable schools, primary schools in particular, to pay some sort of levy via the State. Otherwise he is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the insurance companies to set unreasonable rates.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question on the cost of insurance for primary and secondary schools. Is the Minister really aware of the crisis in regard to the cost of insurance? Having heard his response, I have some concerns.</P>
    <P>The crisis particularly relates to small schools for which two and a half years ago insurance bills were between &euro;7,000 and &euro;15,000. Now they range from &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 and we have heard of some that are higher. In the past week I heard of a school with an insurance bill of &euro;24,000. Figures for larger schools have gone as high as &euro;60,000. That is a major dent in the board of management funds for the year for the principal of those schools who has to write the cheque. Will the Minister respond to this crisis and try to do something about it? I have listened to the T&aacute;naiste for the past two years talking about how she will deal with the insurance issue. We are still waiting for a comprehensive response. I ask the Minister to work seriously on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that it is the parents who bear the brunt of many of these increases? There is increased pressure on them to raise funds, whether through cake sales or, as in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, the raffle of a horse. We are told the issue of insurance is a priority for Government but the reality is that the cost of insurance has increased. House, motor, school and commercial zone insurance premia have risen, not come down.</P>
    <P>The cost of school insurance is affecting the education of children. Will the Minister accept that this is a responsibility for his Department? Can he outline some new initiative in order that <Col N="861"/>we can go back to our constituents and tell them he understands their plight? We do not want the response that his hands are tied or there is nothing he can do. We want initiatives.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister engage in discussions with the managerial bodies which represent the schools? They have indicated that they will be willing to look at some kind of flexible approach to the issue. We need discussion in order to find a solution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are always willing to talk to the joint managerial bodies. To talk about a crisis makes for easy headlines.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The <i>per capita</i> element of insurance in schools, set on the portfolio basis, is about &euro;5 per pupil. I am told by the insurance companies, with which we engaged to try to see if there was anything that could be done to keep the levels of insurance down, that at second level it was anticipated there would be no increases in premia in 2004 and that the average increase for primary schools would be somewhat less than 10%. I include the caveat that where schools have a particular claims history, it will affect their premium and there will be a loading.</P>
    <P>If Deputies know of schools where insurance premia have increased by &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000 or where the increase is exorbitant for no reason and they provide individual examples, I will be pleased to ask my officials to re-engage with the insurance companies to try to find the reason.</P>

   </Speaker>

The programme has been introduced on a phased basis since 1995 and there are over 300 schools or centres offering the programme.</P>
    <P>An intensive support service to assist with the introduction of this innovative and distinct programme into the second level education system was put in place in 1995. This service, dedicated solely to the LCA programme, was continued for a significant number of years, up to the end of the last school year. It would not be appropriate to have an intensive service like this, dedicated solely to the LCA, continue forever into the future. The LCA programme is, at this stage, well established in the education system.</P>
    <P>Inservice training and support for the LCA programme is now, since the beginning of the present school year, provided by the broader second level support service. This service provides inservice and support for a number of second level programmes as well as the LCA. For well established programmes, this arrangement enables best use to be made of the expertise that has been developed and built up over a number of years and can be shared and utilised in a number of different but related areas.</P>
    <P>The concerns expressed have been considered by the steering committee for the programme and officials of my Department recently met the director of the second level support service to further review the situation in the context of the new arrangements for inservice for the programme. The matter is being kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister that one of the points made by the association of leaving certificate applied co-ordinators, in a letter dated 29 January 2004, is that new co-ordinators in existing schools are still waiting for inservice training this year. This programme and its success are based on doing things differently for young people who may otherwise feel alienated from the education system. It has been highly successful for the young people for whom it is suited. Because the methodologies are different, classroom practice and behaviour are also different from the regular schoolroom. It is important that teachers are properly trained and equipped in order that they do not apply the old methods of teaching to this course. I put it to the Minister that these are genuine concerns and urge him to take these problems seriously. As it is a different way of teaching, it needs intensive preparation for teachers in order that it can do what it is intended to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything the Deputy said. The only point of difference is whether a national association of co-ordinators is required or if it should be part of the remit of the <Col N="863"/>second level support service, SLSS. I favour the phasing out of all of these different systems whereby there are co-ordinators for everything. There are so many different groups that we have almost arrived at a point where we need co-ordinators for the co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Deputy said about inservice training. It is important that there is good inservice training for this programme which we should encourage. As the Deputy rightly said, the leaving certificate applied, LCA, programme will help many children who may not find their feet in the normal academic leaving certificate system. I strongly support the programme. The question is if we should consider a separate existence for all of these different bodies or if we should have a strong second level support service that will target inservice training and be able to provide it as required. I accept that there is a difficulty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is that people have not been trained. I do not mind how the Minister deals with it as long as it is dealt with and people receive the appropriate training.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are agreed on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is I do not think anything is happening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The point being made by co-ordinators is that the level of support and inservice training for teachers on this course is not what it should be. This needs to be addressed. Is the Minister happy with this and will he ensure that, whichever section is looking after it, an adequate level of inservice training is provided, as was the case in the past?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the point. There are a number of reasons for the difficulty, the reason we are reviewing the provision of inservice training. There is a high turnover of teachers for this programme in schools. When teachers change from the LCA programme in schools, there seems to be a lack of continuity in the dissemination of information and passing it on to new teachers. It also appears that teaching resources are not passed on and very often the incoming teacher has to start from scratch, perhaps without inservice training. Some of these issues can and should be dealt with by school management. However, I accept the point made about inservice training in regard to which we continue to be in contact with the SLSS.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the total number of persons who have made compensation applications to the Residential Institutions Redress Board at the latest date for which figures are available; the way in which the number of applications compares with the original estimate <Col N="864"/>made by his Department; the estimate of the number of likely applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5235/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is an independent body established under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 which provided for its establishment. The board is in place and fully operational. Judge Sean O&rsquo;Leary, a High Court judge, is its chairperson. Seven other members have also been appointed.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the most recent information available from the board, it has received 2,849 applications. To date, the board has completed the process in 680 cases. The average award is approximately &euro;80,000.</P>
    <P>The board provides regular updates as to the number of claims received on its website, <i>www.rirb.ie</i>. It is finalising its first annual report which will cover the period 16 December 2002 to 31 December 2003. When this report is received, I will make arrangements for it to be laid before both Houses</P>
    <P>of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the board, my Department had estimated that there would be approximately 5,000 applicants. It is too early to determine what the final outcome will be but we can view the information on the website.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures the Minister has provided indicate an increase of almost 700 from the last time I tabled this question in December 2003. This is a fairly significant rise in the number of applications. What are his views on the suggestion by the Comptroller and Auditor General that the cost of the entire package under the indemnity deal may reach &euro;1 billion?</P>
    <P>I tabled another related question to the Minister recently and got a reply to the effect that the information was not available. Perhaps it has since come into his possession. The question concerned cases where religious institutions had handed over responsibility for the defence of these cases to the State, although it is not a co-defendant because of clause 6(a) in the deeds of indemnity dated 5 June 2002. How many such cases are before the courts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid I cannot enlighten the Deputy. I am sorry that she did not get a reply to the question when she originally tabled it. I will certainly pursue the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl11.3-?><Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I got an answer saying the information was not yet available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that there have been one or two such cases. I will endeavour to get the information for the Deputy; it should be available to us. I again apologise that she did not receive the information when she first sought it. That is the cost of the indemnity to date. In regard to sum of &euro;1 billion referred to in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that is his estimate. He does not like me <Col N="865"/>using the word &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo;. In deference to him I will use the word &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo;. He estimates that we may have a contingent liability of &euro;1 billion for the redress board, not the indemnity. The figure we have, which I do not yet have any reason to change, is &euro;508 million. We still estimate that it will come in around that figure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to 700 applications since December. She can do her maths on this one. The average number of applications up to December was about 50 a week. It may have since dropped to about 48 per week. There is a belief that more cases present in the initial stages but if we work on the basis of an average of 50 per week, the total number of cases would be about 6,000. That is a guesstimate on my part, a word I do not mind using.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not totally within my control. We want to try to avoid coming with lists every two or three months or so. A number of people have indicated that they want the institutions in which they were involved included.</P>
    <P>We are consulting with other Departments, particularly the Department of Health of Children, where searches in its records are under way. We have sought advice from the Attorney General regarding the inclusion of a number of the institutions and we are waiting for this before we proceed with the decision to include the additional institutions in the schedule.</P>

     <Quest>the number of second level schools which have established student councils in accordance with the terms of the Education Act 1998; the steps being taken to encourage other schools to establish such councils; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5257/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has recently completed a survey of all post-primary schools on this issue. Student councils have been established in 558 of the 743 schools surveyed. Under section 27 of the Education Act 1998, students in a post-primary school may establish a student council whose role is to promote the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. This development originated in my Department&rsquo;s recognition that students have a <Col N="866"/>voice and contribution to make to their school. These councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community.</P>
    <P>My Department issued comprehensive guidelines on student councils to all second level schools in 2002. These provide practical guidance to school management, teachers and students on the establishment and operation of student councils. Officials of my Department are participating in a working group on student councils that was established in June 2003 by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The group comprises representatives of students and all the partners in education and will work to encourage the establishment of effective and democratic student councils in all second level schools in the country.</P>
    <P>The group will examine the number, composition and operation of existing student councils in second level schools and will seek to identify the barriers, if any, to the establishment of student councils. The National Children&rsquo;s Office has recently invited tenders for the appointment of a researcher to support the work of the working group. The group will report on its findings, including a proposed three year strategy to support the establishment and development of student councils, to my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, by December 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of schools that have student councils, which has increased in the recent past, is encouraging. I understand from a previous reply that there may be 100 schools in the State that do not have boards of management. When there is no board of management, it is almost impossible to establish a student council as these are established under such boards. Does the Minister intend to do anything about the schools without boards of management? Has the Minister met the national association of school students, an umbrella body for school councils? I have found it to include a responsible group of young people who are encouraging the establishment of student councils in schools that do not already have them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl11-?><Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am speaking off the top of my head, there are 100 or 110 schools that do not have boards of management. A number of these schools do not have boards of management because of an ongoing difficulty regarding their legal status. We are pursuing the matter of establishing boards of management with the schools in question. Apart from meeting student councils in schools, the only second level student body I have met is the Union of Secondary Students.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="867"/>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the correct name of the body to which I referred.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Officials of my Department have met this body on a number of occasions. I agree with the Deputy that the number of student councils that have been established is encouraging. However, I am unsure whether there is a uniform agreement or standard of response to student councils. This is why the working group has been established. While the councils are good, democratic and have a direct input into certain schools, they may not be as good in other schools. The purpose of the working group is to ensure the councils have a real say in issues that affect students and schools generally.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister has met the body and I spoke to last year&rsquo;s president of the Union of Secondary Students a number of times. While each school may have a student council, it can be difficult for them to meet. Does the Minister have any proposals to fund the union so that students from different schools can get more involved together?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Union of Secondary Students requested money when I met it. I laid down the conditions under which I would provide money. For example, I asked for a business plan and details of how the union would operate and spend the funds. The view has recently been expressed that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g operate to look after the views of young people. We try to ensure their findings are worked into policy. It has been said that we should avoid moving from circumstances where young people had no voice to having diverse voices. It might be as well to work through one body.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be good to get diverse voices of young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know. Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g cater for people under 18 and it might be better to follow this route.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Has a report been issued by the working group on the participation on student councils? A report would be useful to examine the levels of participation in disadvantaged areas in comparison to better off areas. If this is not happening, does the Minister acknowledge that it is crucial it should be done? Student councils enable better participation by students in a democratic process and may, for example, encourage people to vote. Such councils may also make students feel that they have more of a shareholding in society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The group was established in June 2003. It has had a number of meetings and has decided to do what the Deputy has suggested. It proposes to conduct research to establish what <Col N="868"/>is happening within schools, what effect student councils have and what status their voice has. This is why the researcher is being appointed. The group hopes to have this research completed and make a report available to me by the end of 2004.</P>
    <P>The group is trying to agree a meaningful role for student councils, identify barriers to the establishment of such councils, identify the measures needed to encourage them, identify the required training needs and resource materials, make recommendations about training resource materials not only for students, but also for all the education partners to facilitate this, manage and develop the production of resource and training teachers and promote and publicise the importance of establishing student councils.</P>
    <P>The group is focused on getting the councils up and running. I am sure that when they are in place, the experience of being involved in the process will help produce more civic-minded students. For this to work, student councils must be listened to.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>My sister would tell the Minister this. She is a member of the council in her school.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This has the potential to produce &mdash; I hate to use the term &mdash; civic-minded citizens who know that the democratic process can make change. If that is their experience, that will be positive. If the experience is the opposite, the effect will be the reverse, so we must ensure that they work well.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was originally expected that the review group would report to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, not later than 31 October 2003. However, the task was more complex than expected. Extensive work has been completed by the group, and that is at an advanced stage. It is the intention of the group to have a report submitted to the HEA by the end of March. The authority will then advise me of its views. I will then make decisions in respect of the capital investment programme for the third level sector in the context of the capital envelope of funds available to me.</P>
    <P>I considered it prudent to re-evaluate and review the overall position on third level capital projects and to establish priorities for future years. The review was commissioned against a background of very considerable demands on the <Col N="869"/>Exchequer for capital financing for higher education projects and the need to set out clearly the priorities and phasing of future investment programmes in the sector.</P>
    <P>The remit of the review group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Kelly, is to develop criteria for prioritising projects mindful of existing building stock and future requirements and to prioritise on a project basis accordingly. Each institution has met the group, made a presentation of its institutional strategy and set the capital development proposals in such a strategic context.</P>
    <P>While all major projects at third level remain paused pending the outcome of the work of the review group, the Deputy will know that I have made provision of &euro;25 million in the 2004 Estimates for the capital element of cycle three of the programme for research in third level institutions, or PRTLI, to start this year. That allocation is a clear recognition of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the programme, which will play a key role in developing world-class capabilities in research and innovation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the report is due by the end of March. I make no apologies for being parochial on this question. On 15 November 1999, the Department told the colleges of education that they had been placed at the top of the third level agenda for capital investment. In particular, I wish to put the case for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, where both students and staff are working in really atrocious conditions. They have been a victim of that pause. Will the Minister give any hope to that college?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Being parochial is not a sin, though sometimes in this House one would imagine it to be so. The Deputy need not apologise for it. I can give Mary Immaculate the same comfort as I can give any other institution. The project will be thoroughly evaluated, and I will respect the outcome of the review process. It is important that the process be needs-based. The group has been asked, in evaluating the proposals that it is putting forward to me, to have regard to the following criteria: health and safety; environment and access; student numbers and profile; national policies; regional and institutional balance; programme balance; collaboration between institutions; the national spatial strategy; the needs of the Border, midlands and western region; land purchase; urgent replacement projects; projects required to improve access and to accommodate student stock increases, which would affect Mary Immaculate; overall adequacy of built space <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> student stock and staff numbers; addressing a space deficit; institutional strategies; and so on. Being as familiar as I am with the college&rsquo;s circumstances through various representations <Col N="870"/>made by Mary Immaculate, I am sure that it would qualify under many of those criteria.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the start of questions to the Minister for Education and Science, I was outlining the reasons that the Green Party opposes this Bill. The intervening hour and a quarter has not changed our position. This Bill seems to have been formed through the Department of Finance. The Department was asked to make savings and rather than think strategically of the needs of Irish agriculture, the civil servants in the Department have instead chosen to see what could be done administratively to make the savings being demanded of it. Ultimately, that lack of a strategic approach will be to the disadvantage of all involved in Irish agriculture, from the individual farmers to the consumer, in whose interest the issue of food quality rests, if there is no confidence in how food is produced and how high quality food is marketed, not only in Ireland but abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government must be taken to task for that lack of a strategic approach. I highlighted how food agencies have been far too timid in challenging other aspects of Government policy outside incineration and their effect in undermining food quality in Ireland. However, it seems that for those involved in the administration of Irish agriculture, the best strategy has always been to keep one&rsquo;s head down <Col N="871"/>rather than be innovative and bring about changes for the betterment of Irish agriculture and the quality of Irish food. It is not unfair to say that the Department of Agriculture and Food, in its previous forms, when it included the Department of the Marine, was traditionally the most conservative of Departments. As we face a new century and the new reality of the accession of ten new countries into the European Union and the challenge of where food is likely to be produced within the Single Market of the European Union, rather than face that challenge the Government is instead deciding to retreat into a shell, returning to traditional formats and failing to look at the innovative approaches that we need to produce different and better types of Irish food that can be marketed differently.</P>
    <P>From a green perspective, the ultimate disappointment with this Bill is that the organic sector is once again being left aside in how it is valued within the agricultural sector and how it is likely to be promoted. It is particularly disappointing from the Minister&rsquo;s point of view since, to be fair, at least in the past 18 months, because of changes proposed to the Common Agricultural Policy and the nature of negotiations going on in the World Trade Organisation, the Minister has been coming around to the realisation, and articulating in this House, that we need better quality Irish food achieved through better support for the organic sector. Yet in front of us we have a Bill that totally negates that approach. The Minister&rsquo;s words in this House ring ever more hollow because of a failure to follow through with an appropriate administrative structure. The Green Party believes that, if we truly wish to support the organic element in agriculture and its horticultural component, there must be a specified, stand-alone agency. Bord Glas is the obvious vehicle to help that movement forward. The Minister, in summing up this debate when we finish Second Stage, might argue against many of those points.</P>
    <P>Aside from what he is proposing in the Bill, which is ultimately administrative, the real challenge facing the Minister, who has been in office for such a long time, is the mind-set that permeates agriculture. On Tuesday, the Irish Farmers Association held a large-scale lobby on the effects of the nitrates directive. On the surface, trying to live up to the directive will cause inconvenience because it requires new practices in agriculture and involves costs. An innovative Government would have risen to this challenge. Rather than placing the burden on the agricultural community by stating it must live with the costs, it would have structured the introduction of the directive in such a way as to combine appropriate incentives with recognition that current farming practices, particularly the use of nitrates and nitrate loads on many farms, cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The leadership style chosen by the Irish Farmers Association is an issue, but part of the <Col N="872"/>problem lies in the Department&rsquo;s lack of willingness to properly interact with and confront the relevant issues to ensure the introduction of the necessary changes, whether for environmental purposes or to sustain agriculture in the future. The silence of the Government on this issue is disappointing.</P>
    <P>It is important from a food quality as much as a water point of view that we get the nitrates directive right. Ultimately, the disappointment and anger expressed by the farming community is matched and mirrored in the disappointment of many citizens who believe we have a high quality environment which we should do our utmost to enhance and protect. The food quality agencies have been silent on this matter and have shown an unwillingness to state what needs to be stated on these issues.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for establishing stand-alone State agencies, as articulated by Ministers in the past, is the freedom to make policy and statements which would not politically compromise Ministers or Governments. The conservatism of the Department of Agriculture and Food appears to be matched by the conservatism of food agencies such as Bord Bia. If the Minister was intent on shaking up the food marketing and quality elements of State bodies, he should have adopted Deputy Upton&rsquo;s position of establishing a wide-ranging organisation encompassing all elements of food.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that separating fishing from the food promotion element of Enterprise Ireland, and submerging Bord Glas in Bord Bia creates two-headed monsters, to the extent that the interests represented by Bord Glas, namely, those of the horticultural industries, will not only take a back seat, but may disappear from the screen. Those of us who oppose the Bill and the merger of these two bodies believe the move will not deliver a new super-agency, but that Bord Bia will do what it has always done, with the same emphasis and priorities. The Minister has yet to articulate how the interests represented by Bord Glas will be represented in the new body.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I am loath to address the composition of a board whose establishment I oppose in the first instance. It needs to be re-emphasised, however, that the commitment of Government towards gender equality and balance in State bodies and agencies in general is mealy-mouthed and needs to be specified. I am disappointed that we suddenly appear to have lost sight of the 40% quota, which has been stated Government policy since the mid-1990s. As the finance spokesperson of the Green Party, I have been arguing with the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Finance, on the issue of gender balance on the board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. One continually hears the argument that it is difficult to find qualified women in various areas. The Green Party and many members of the Opposition will not accept that argument from the Minister in this case because the growth in part-time farming on <Col N="873"/>family farms has resulted in female dominance in the area of food marketing.</P>
    <P>If ever there was a case for specifying a gender quota on a State body, this is it. I would even argue that the new body should be the first State agency with a majority of female representation given the manner in which the industry has developed in recent years. That is particularly true of the horticultural sector and for this reason I ask the Minister to specify a quota for female representation on the board should the Bill be enacted.</P>
    <P>To allay the fears I have expressed, the Minister should also give appropriate recognition to the role of the horticultural industry by specifying that the new body include a quota of persons who are involved in that sector. The same should apply with regard to organic activities and marketing. If the Minister fails to specify the areas which should be represented on the board, the final result will be the appointment of a group of people by the Minister, some of whom will have direct experience of the general agriculture industry, but many of them will have the coincidental advantage of membership of the Government parties. In such circumstances, we would not know whether the board selected would benefit agriculture and society.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Green Party opposes the Bill because it is motivated by cost and administrative considerations inspired by the Department of Finance. It also fails to appreciate and enhance the role of horticulture in the agriculture industry. If a new body and administrative structure for the board are established, they must recognise the contribution of women as well as those involved in horticulture and organic industries. Only then should the marketing element be considered in the formation of the board.</P>
    <P>While I am not optimistic that the Minister will accept any of my proposals, it is important to place on record that the Government cannot take pride in this Bill, and the House should not be spending time on it. Instead, the Government should introduce more productive legislation on other aspects of the agriculture industry.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will first address several of the points made by Deputy Boyle, who argued that the Bill will be a disadvantage to everybody, including farmers. He criticised the agencies involved for failing to comment on certain issues and suggested the House was wasting time dealing with the Bill. We spent much of the past week discussing the Eircom issue, which has become fairly dated. Members will have received a letter from the Communication Workers Union yesterday castigating the Green Party.</P>
   
    <P>It states, &ldquo;The Green Party says it wants to encourage more employee share ownership schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that if that is the case then the party should learn more about them. It continues:</P><Col N="874"/>
    <P LI="1">Attacking the Minister on the basis of the information obtained, without attempting to get a full understanding of the facts, is politics of the worst kind. Eircom workers and indeed retired Eircom staff deserve better than this.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is the kind of comment one will hear when these people act on an issue and rightly so if what we just heard is anything to go by.</P>
    <P>This may appear to be a Bill of little significance and dealing with a topic of limited interest. One of my colleagues expressed some surprise when I expressed a desire to speak on the Bill and he inquired as to my interest in the subject.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I could see from where he was coming when the Deputy started to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a great interest as a consumer and also as a public representative and a taxpayer. It is a very important issue and everybody should have an interest in it.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the often-expressed view that, with proper organisation Ireland could, and should, be feeding half of Europe. This is a very significant Bill and I am hopeful it will lead to a new approach to some aspects of the food industry, particularly in the area of horticulture, which was mentioned earlier in the debate. A dedicated subsidiary board will be established within the new Bord Bia to cater for horticulture. Many of us were concerned that horticulture would be submerged within the new body. Unfortunately, instead of being able to achieve the objective of feeding half of Europe, we appear to be at a point where we cannot cater for our own needs, particularly in a range of horticultural products. This is an area in which we should be leading the market. I do not know who is to blame for that situation and I have no intention of trying to apportion blame, but things are not right in several aspects of the business. It may be lack of co-ordination at national policy level, an unwillingness to work hard enough at some other levels, climatic difficulties, or simply a case of there being easier ways of earning money other than the hard slog and uncertainty that goes with the growing of the produce. However, I am not in any position to be judgmental. Whatever the reason, it appears we are losing the battle in some areas of the fruit and vegetable business. Regrettably, areas with a tradition for growing fruit and vegetables, such as Wexford, north County Dublin and seaside areas such as west Cork, seem to be fading from the scene as major players. I am hopeful that this new body will help to get all of those growers back into the scene in a bigger and better way in the future.</P>
    <P>When we question how the changes in the process came about, there always seems to be an answer that more or less suggests the issue is beyond our control. For instance, on the importation of potatoes the excuse usually given is that we cannot compete with the sunny climate <Col N="875"/>in Cyprus and yet there is no mention of the cost of transport. The difference is that the product from Cyprus is invariably presented in a particular fashion. It is clean, graded, packed so that it is plainly visible for examination and the customer can easily confirm that it is in good condition. In my limited experience, I believe the customer is now willing and able to pay extra for such guarantees of quality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins referred to the growers in east Cork. They put a significant effort into grading and cleaning the produce. Unfortunately, the project did not succeed, but projects such as this will need to become the norm rather than a rarity, and not be confined to any particular geographical area.</P>
    <P>There will be similar excuses given in respect of many other food items, even though they may have to be transported thousands of miles in 40-foot containers before arriving at Dublin docks, Ringaskiddy or elsewhere. The latest cover-all excuse is that the major players, who control the superstores, want to import everything. These major players are all hard-headed business people and if given the right product, at the right price, will do business locally.</P>
    <P>Ireland can and should be a world leader in many of the agribusiness areas. Many of the reasons for not being so do not stand up to scrutiny. Transport costs, for instance, have been coped with by many other countries in this regard. It has been possible for Holland, a relatively small country in geographical terms, to capture the bulb market for most of Europe. Israel, despite all the difficulties it faces and the potential excuses that could be put forward for not being able to do so, can fly plane-loads of fresh flowers through the night to Covent Garden and other British and Irish markets. These are just a few examples of people surmounting great difficulties and I believe that we can do the same in the agrifood business if we show the commitment.</P>
    <P>We can supply the product, we have the knowledge. We have the culture that is required, particularly in the meat section of the business, but we need to apply that same drive, expertise and commitment to all other sectors. Despite the proven success of the big operators in the meat sector, we must find some way of encouraging the smaller producer in horticulture. Big is not always beautiful. I do not know what acreage of glasshouses would be required to make someone a viable operator in that sector but we should not adopt an attitude of discouraging producers just because they are not in the super league, as seems to have been the case previously. This is an indigenous business with significant potential. Hundreds of families were able to make a living from it, particularly in north County Dublin. While I accept it would be difficult for a family to do that now, we need to preserve and enlarge the business, rather than reduce it.</P><Col N="876"/>
    <P>There are health-related, employment-related and economic reasons, including the balance of payments, why we should make people more aware and more supportive of the Irish product. We must be able to indicate to people whether or not a product is Irish. We allowed EU regulations to be used in far too rigorous a fashion to prevent us identifying this fact very clearly. Our neighbours across the water never seem to have any problem in getting around obstacles like that.</P>
    <P>One of the primary benefits of this Bill is the pooling of resources and expertise that are present in both Bord Bia and Bord Glas at present. Bord Bia has offices in most EU countries and the combined expertise of the amalgamated body will bring together the necessary expertise that will promote the entire food and horticultural industries at home and abroad. It is ludicrous to suggest that Bord Glas could do that business. I am pleased that the interests of concerned stakeholders, staff and the horticulture sector are being adequately safeguarded in what is an extremely important industry for our economy. The Minister detailed in his opening statement how that was being achieved. The representations by the various interest groups were catered for. It is worth remembering that the agrifood and drink sector accounts for more than 8% of Ireland&rsquo;s GDP, 7.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s exports and 10% of total employment. Its importance to the economy cannot be overstated and we need to market it in a professional and modern manner.</P>
    <P>We are often told that agriculture is a declining sector in terms of its economic importance. Far from seeing the decline in traditional patterns of employment in agriculture as a negative factor, we should see it as the ideal opportunity to re-focus our employment strategy and to build on our core strengths. Several speakers made that point regarding additional activity to compensate for other areas. Agrifood accounts for 25% of our net exports and is central to the economic well-being of the State.</P>
    <P>The accession of ten new member states to the EU, all of which have considerable horticultural industries, will present further challenges and opportunities. The methods used to market our agrifood sector ten years ago may no longer be appropriate. One of the points made by Deputy Boyle was that Bord Glas has been in place for just ten or 12 years. Things are changing by the month, let alone by the year, so it is time to make a move. The amalgamated body will have the dynamism and expertise to confront the considerable challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak about the labelling of food, which I have felt strongly about for some time. When one is in a supermarket nowadays, it seems as if half of the food one sees is labelled as &ldquo;home-made&rdquo; or &ldquo;farmhouse&rdquo;. These terms have become so widely used that their effectiveness is now devalued. If we do not successfully regulate this area, I worry that we will be left with an extremely cynical <Col N="877"/>consumer base. I would like the newly constituted Bord Bia to engage in an aggressive marketing campaign to promote the best of Irish produce. Labelling and presentation must be rigorously accurate if consumers are to have confidence in the products they are consuming. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, will be aware of a product produced in his area which is sold under the brand name of his home town. People throughout the country can identify the product they want and will ask for it on that basis. This is how many other products should be sold.</P>
    <P>I recently discussed with a colleague the subject of the importation into this country of Argentine beef. While I have little doubt as to the taste and quality of such beef, as a layman I feel there is nothing to beat a piece of prime beef from the Golden Vale. While I may not always be able to identify a piece of Argentine beef, I am sure that I know Irish beef at all times. Indeed, I can almost tell the difference between Cork beef and beef from other counties. When consumers, including tourists, order beef in restaurants in this country, they are unwittingly ordering imported beef. It is scarcely credible that this should happen in a country which arguably produces the best beef in the world. A great deal of work is being done to promote Irish beef abroad, but the home market cannot be forgotten about.</P>
    <P>When one has the best product in the world, one should shout it from the rooftops. There are many ways of getting this message across without being in conflict with EU directives. Under the terms of the F&eacute;ile Bia scheme, which is run by Bord Bia, people can sign up to a charter to assure customers that the beef being served is of Irish origin. The appropriate, catchy and simple slogan Great Food &mdash; An Irish Tradition is used for the F&eacute;ile Bia scheme. It is an excellent slogan as one does not have to say much more. It could be varied slightly to be applied in other areas. I encourage the Minister to ask his officials to pursue this matter. We may be too worried about EU regulations in such a context. We saw last week that the GDP pact, relating to 3% of expenditure, was changed, three years after we pointed out that it needed to be amended. There is a need for flexibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the catering facilities at a number of IFA gatherings, one of which was in Wexford, did not comply with the terms of the F&eacute;ile Bia scheme. It has been said to me, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on House Services, that the restaurant in this building is not part of the F&eacute;ile Bia scheme, but this is not accurate. The D&aacute;il has signed up to the scheme and a sign showing the charter is on display at the entrance to the main dining room. I commend Bord Bia for the job it has done to date. I urge the Minister to dedicate even greater resources to this area as I feel that it can generate considerable benefits for the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>As a public representative who has spent his political life promoting co-operation between North and South, when I have had the <Col N="878"/>opportunity to work at that level, I feel that there is no better example than the agrifood industry of a sector in which the interests of all parts of the island can be promoted together. I was profoundly disappointed when the Executive in the North ground to a halt earlier this year. It is my firm belief that the cross-Border bodies provided for in the Good Friday Agreement are in the interests of all Irish people. There is no logic in having a food promotion body in the South that exists in direct competition with a similar body in the North. This is surely a natural area of co-operation for our mutual benefit. I urge that an all-Ireland approach to the promotion of our agrifood sector be adopted. We used to have to worry about levies etc., but I do not believe that such difficulties continue to exist. We must work more closely with our counterparts in the North as we are now doing successfully in respect of tourism. Those on both sides of the Border share a common island and should have a common, all-Ireland, approach to global marketing.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that there are separate farming unions North and South of the Border. The problems faced by farmers who live in my constituency of Cork South-Central, 37% of which is rural, include acquiring reasonable prices for their products and dealing with EU regulations. I am sure that such problems are also faced by farmers in the Lagan Valley. Although we are separated by a Border, we are not prevented from working together and we should not be concerned by it. Ireland should be marketed, in big letters, as a single food-producing entity.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker &mdash; perhaps it was Deputy Timmins or Deputy Ferris &mdash; said that the quality of Irish produce is recognised worldwide, but this is not the case. Perhaps it is recognised in places where we promote certain aspects of it, but I do not believe we are getting full value for the standard of the produce we export. I do not believe we are getting the full recognition we deserve for our food, with the exception of specialist areas such as cheese and meat. We could work to promote a far wider range of produce throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Ten or 12 years have passed since the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, and I put forward the idea of a joint tourism board for both parts of this small country, which has a small population, and it has taken a great deal of time to get it moving. We should work together in all other areas in which we share common approaches and objectives. I do not see why Irish food and drink cannot be promoted on an all-Ireland basis. The basis of such co-operation exists in the Good Friday agreement and we should have the courage to take it forward.</P>
    <P>The interests of producers and consumers have been mentioned by some speakers. This issue is of crucial importance. People have the money to pay extra for certain products. Deputy Ferris mentioned that organically produced food was a <Col N="879"/>feature of the Irish market before it was described or sold in such terms. Many people have the wherewithal to pay and they will pay for a good product. The conflict between the interests of producers and consumers will continue to be a feature of this debate. The interests of both groups should be recognised and catered for as much as possible. There may be conflict in some areas, such as availability and price, but there should be no conflict in the area of quality. We have quality and we should ensure that we maintain it. Indeed, as our American friends would say, we have got it so we should flaunt it. We have a lot going for us.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss many other important issues, such as genetic modification, that were raised by other speakers during this debate. Contrary to what was said earlier &mdash; I appreciate the concerns of Members like Deputy Upton &mdash; this Bill attempts to give horticulture a chance on the big stage. The outlets, marketing and the big personnel team are in place, and Bord Bia deserves its opportunity within that team. I compliment the Minister on this Bill. Deputy Ferris and others referred to health and safety aspects of Irish produce, which is what we should be marketing. We no longer have difficulties in that regard as the problems that existed were dealt with speedily and competently by the Minister. This Bill is another example of his approach to promoting this business.</P>
    <P>The international market has changed. Marketing has changed, as the Minister said, and everything has become internationalised. We have to be efficient, competitive and market-orientated. It is fine for Deputy Boyle and others to speak about selling one&rsquo;s produce down the road and catering for various sectors of the market, but we should also be interested in catering for large markets, multiples and big consumers &mdash; that is the world in which we live. We would all like the old village economy to return, like the old days, but that will not happen. We are competing. Those who are trying to produce and sell the material are entitled to our strong support and full promotion throughout the world. The Minister has spoken about establishing complementary international branding, which is the answer to many of our problems. I think we should continue to promote the brand we have developed, which is one of high quality Irish food of the old tradition. I commend the Minister on this Bill and I hope everybody, particularly those with a genuine interest in and concern for the agrifood sector, will row in behind him on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important Bill that will see the amalgamation of Bord Glas and Bord Bia. It is important that we give time to discuss our major industry beyond the farm gate. The Minister&rsquo;s speech was short but to the point. The Second Stage of this Bill gives all Members an <Col N="880"/>opportunity to expand their views on the agrifood industry that is so important to the country. This is at a time when the EU will expand with the admission of the ten accession states. With this, there will be new pressures on the Irish agrifood industry and the whole economy. Agriculture and food is still our major industry and has gone through turbulent and changing times. It needs to be debated.</P>
    <P>The question still has not been answered in this debate as to why this Bill is needed. What is the compelling reason to amalgamate these two agencies? I am concerned about combining bodies such as these when there are other opportunities and challenges for us in this area. Take the example of how beef is marketed in Ireland. I hear the Green Party, in particular, speak about organic beef and food. I am in favour of the organic foods sector developing and expanding. However, beef produced in Ireland is closer and more practical to organic standards than that produced anywhere else. Acres of newsprint have been written against the Irish beef industry and the advertisements made during the BSE crisis did not make our industry proud.</P>
    <P>In this debate, we should be more focused in promoting the beef industry that has got a hammering in the past. Certainly cowboys were involved, but they were a minority. There are cowboys involved in every industry, including the odd one in politics. However, those cowboys gave the beef industry a bad name. Many producers have gone to huge expense and effort to produce top quality beef. In the Tipperary South constituency, this is exemplified by two efficient beef processing plants that produce some of the best beef in the world. Beef from there is closer to organic standards because of the home-grown grain and grass from some of the safest and healthiest countryside used in cattle rearing. This standard was lost in the past and it has never been properly marketed. No matter where one goes in the world, even in some European countries, it is obvious that good quality Irish beef has not been promoted as well as it could be.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done to improve presentation and traceability. It is wonderful that, in supermarket displays, one can see from what farm the beef has come and the pride of the individual producers in their product. The odd time when I do go to the supermarket, I always check for the producer&rsquo;s details. It is great to be able to check the name and address of the producer and the herd number. People should be conscious that this is happening instead of being too critical of farmers, meat factories and the meat processing industry. We have beaten ourselves to death in this regard. Are we sure of the traceability of Argentine beef imports? I question it because the traceability of our beef products is much better.</P>
    <P>Where did the idea for the amalgamation of Bord Glas and Bord Bia come from? Who was pressing for it? Is it a money saving exercise promoted by the three wise men who were <Col N="881"/>looking at tightening the budget? Political influence is another area of concern when setting up any State board. I hope that the persons appointed to this new board will be genuinely interested in the production and promotion of food. Only an hour ago, I received a telephone call from a person involved in well-known State board saying that its chief executive&rsquo;s position was threatened because of political interference. Although I have not checked the full details, it seems there was a meeting in recent days and, due to political interference, the chief executive may resign. The food industry has significant money-making potential for some, such as the co-operatives and the Larry Goodmans, and there is much at stake. We, therefore, need clarification on this matter. Every week accusations are made in this House about political interference. The best people, genuinely interested in promoting the food industry, need to be appointed when establishing this board.</P>
    <P>There are concerns in the potato industry about this amalgamation. Those who have invested heavily in the industry are concerned that their products are not being marketed as well as they could. There is huge potential in this industry. We need to help producers and promote their business from an Irish point of view. We will come under increased pressure from the ten new member states so we must develop the potato industry and the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, Tipperary Co-operative Creamery with Monaghan Mushrooms have filled a void by creating good employment and opportunities in an area where agriculture has changed. The Minister&rsquo;s good offices helped the mushroom industry in Tipperary but now the industry is under pressure and many of those who invested in the business and borrowed from the banks have closed their units. It is sad to see the units lying idle or in some cases being taken over by co-operatives. One of the banks that provided finance for the industry has been reasonably kind to these people but something must be done to help those in the mushroom industry who are in difficulty. It is a short-term difficulty in a labour-intensive industry. The Minister should look at that in the coming months. Agriculture will change with the advent of the Fischler proposals. There is an opportunity for us to cultivate home-grown vegetables and people could expand their business into that area if they received training and support. We import a large quantity of vegetables but we should be trying to grow more of them. Although the Fischler proposals will change agriculture, we need to continue to employ people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week we discussed the nitrates directive. A lobby group of farming organisations met us but I wonder why they lobby the Opposition Members because there is a limit to what we can do. They should be lobbying the Minister who is smiling at me now because as he said some of those people signed up to the agreement. However, more attention should be <Col N="882"/>given to agreements. On a broader scale, the nitrates directive will have a significant impact on commercial farmers who are extremely worried about it because they work full-time in agriculture, have the largest bank loans, create employment, and give work to the co-operative industry. They are essential to the organisations that operate beyond the farm gate. Co-operatives such as Dairygold, Kerry Foods and Glanbia will depend on them. The Minister must fight hard for a derogation for these people. We have been slow and easy in fighting this but it has gone too far. The farming organisations signed up to it but they have made a mistake which needs to be reversed. I urge the Minister not to leave any stone unturned on this. There may be people in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who have different ideas but our national industry must be given priority. This nitrates directive will have a serious effect and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the cutbacks to Teagasc around the country. Closing down local offices that have been of such benefit to small producers should be reconsidered. Cutting back on the Teagasc budget is not helpful. Whatever people may think of Teagasc, it is involved in education and that is essential if our industry is to grow and develop. If the Minister is saving money by this amalgamation he should put that money back into marketing, training and education in the industry. Teagasc is the only agency that can teach people how to produce mushrooms, potatoes and other vegetables, the production of which is important to our economy.</P>
    <P>This issue also touches the health of the nation. I am amazed at the effort dedicated to selling fast foods that are bad for us. Obesity is a major problem around the world yet at every ten yards one sees an advertisement for burger outlets. Next month the Government will introduce a ban on smoking in the workplace &mdash; although Deputy Walsh was not happy about that. There should also be some kind of restraint or tax on advertising for food that is harmful. I urge some restriction in the future on those foods which contribute to obesity because that is a serious problem for families and for our society.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me the real reason for this proposed merger? Is it to save some money or is it in the interest of agriculture? This debate is positive and it is important to cover every aspect of the issue because food and agriculture are connected and we have benefited greatly from a vibrant agricultural sector. We should be proud of our food industry. Many of our co-ops have made a significant international impact and there is great opportunity to develop further but we must meet more challenges too. I defy any other European country to say their air or water is cleaner than ours or their grass is as good as ours. We have the best and we should be prouder of our industry.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EoinRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House. The primary purpose of this legislation is to amalgamate Bord Glas and Bord Bia. Bord Bia was established in 1994 after the amalgamation of CBF and ABT and has the statutory function of promoting Irish food and drink at home and abroad. Bord Glas, the horticultural development board, was set up under the Bord Glas Act 1990 to improve all aspects of horticulture.</P>
    <P>Ministers are often accused of not consulting when they introduce legislation or make changes. In this case, however, the Minister consulted 34 organisations. The main concern expressed was that there should be a dedicated horticultural subsidiary board of this new body. The Minister has done that. I welcome the fact that horticulture will be given a proper role in this new body.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition asked why this Bill was necessary. Bord Bia has 55 staff, while Bord Glas has nine staff and a board of 12. That does not stand up to scrutiny. Under this new body, Bord Glas will be able to benefit from all the expertise in Bord Bia and will be able to use the logo, existing quality schemes and offices Bord Bia has abroad. One of the success stories of horticulture has been the mushrooms we export. I hope we will be able, through our offices abroad, to get new markets for our mushrooms which are of high quality. This Bill offers the horticultural industry an opportunity to avail of many new services and the expertise which has benefited Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hayes about the quality of our meat. Irish lamb and beef are as good as the best produced anywhere in the world. The way lambs are reared means the meat is organic and the beef is almost the same. We have two great products which are doing extremely well. There have been difficulties over the years, but they are doing extremely well because of their high quality. We should recognise that. I have no doubt the same can be done in the horticultural area.</P>
    <P>There are challenges ahead. Ten new countries will soon join the European Union, which will create further difficulties in the horticultural area. I spoke to growers in north County Dublin recently who told me that tomatoes are being imported for &euro;4 a box. It is impossible for anyone to compete with that. Products in France are sourced locally and that has been successful. We must ensure that our retailers source their food and vegetables locally when they are in season. Small and large towns in France also have markets where farmers sell their goods. I am glad <Col N="884"/>that is becoming more fashionable here because it will help to develop our horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>People want quality. They want to know that the fruit and vegetables have been taken from the farm that morning or the day before. They want to know they are fresh and wholesome. There has been an increase in the amount of fruit and vegetables eaten in this country. People are becoming more health conscious and eating healthier diets. I hope that continues. There is a great opportunity for the horticultural industry to develop as a result. However, products must be sourced locally because we will not be able to compete against some of these new countries which produce vegetables in larger markets and sell them throughout the European Union. If we have good quality food and vegetables which are sourced locally, the horticultural industry will be able to develop and expand.</P>
    <P>The amount of packaging on food and vegetables in supermarkets drives me mad and I hope the new body will examine this. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is trying to get us to reduce the amount of packaging we use, yet everything in supermarkets is in some type of package such as a plastic tray with cellophane wrapping or cling film. It is almost impossible to touch the fruit and vegetables in the supermarkets. They are all pre-packed. It is an environmental disaster. The new body should try to minimise the amount of packaging we use. People want to know that the products are fresh and that they have just been taken from the farm.</P>
    <P>I wish the new board well. It will face many challenges, but the existing expertise and success of Bord Bia in exporting beef, lamb and other products means the horticultural industry has a good chance of developing and succeeding in this country and in export markets.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the amalgamation of Bord Bia and Bord Glas. Many changes have occurred over the years in the production and sale of food products. Our meat industry, especially beef and lamb, has enjoyed great success throughout the world. Part of that great success is due to our efforts.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on moving quickly when disease threatens. We are conscious of that. I thank him for moving quickly when the poultry industry was threatened with disease. It means a great deal to many areas. I refer to Cappoquin in west Waterford where the production of chickens is seen as an alternative enterprise. Many smaller farmers became involved over the past 20 years. Farm production, factory sales and diversification added value to the industry and meant that there was full employment in the area during the difficult years of the late 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>The agri-food industry continues to play a pivotal role in the economy. The food industry has undergone considerable modernisation to <Col N="885"/>meet the demands of consumers at home and abroad. It is now fitting for us to look at the two bodies involved to see how we can progress them. It is important to move with the times and great challenges are facing agriculture, with CAP reform, decoupling and all the other changes. Not everyone feels all these are good. Before these changes were mooted, farming was changing anyway. Many of our young people were getting further education and may have seen easier ways of living. However it is important that the best price and the best production and sales methods are employed to promote our food sales across the world.</P>
    <P>Given its low import content, the sector accounts for 25% of our net export earnings. Our markets are balanced between the United Kingdom &mdash; once our only significant market &mdash; at 40%, the eurozone at 30% and the third country markets beyond the EU also at 30%. I am confident that the outlook for the entire food industry is positive as well as challenging.</P>
    <P>The value of horticulture in 2003 was &euro;40 million. This is ranked third after beef and milk, which is difficult to believe. Another diverse and well-developed sector comprises two main areas: the production of amenity products such as trees, shrubs and flowers; and the food sector, which produces a range of edible fruit and vegetable products. Sales of plants, flowers etc. at garden centres increased by 9% last year. Some &euro;59 million was spent on outdoor plants, &euro;6 million on indoor plants and an amazing &euro;4 million on cut flowers. This shows the great outlook that exists for agriculture and horticulture production.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of both bodies is timely. Significant work is to be done. These are challenging times with greater consumer numbers. The Minister is correct in his approach, on which I compliment him, and I support the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it. All the functions of Bord Glas can properly be subsumed into Bord Bia. It is desirable for a single authority to have a central focus for the development of food and agricultural products. I believe Deputy Hayes said Ireland has an enviable reputation for the quality of its agricultural produce. It is literally famous throughout the world for its beef, lamb and dairy products. We can be very proud of our food products.</P>
    <P>There are two important sections in this Bill, section 11, which defines agricultural products, and section 12, which enunciates the functions of the board. There is no mention of the dreaded GM in the Bill. The people do not want to consume genetically modified food and do not want it in the food chain and this should be made clear in the Bill. Perhaps this could be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A few years ago this House debated two European regulations on that topic. At a meeting <Col N="886"/>in Brussels on 8 December 2003, I learnt with some concern that Ireland had voted in favour of allowing the introduction into the European market of genetically modified sweetcorn, known at Bt11. As it happened this was a draft Commission proposal that was not passed at that stage. As Ireland now holds the Presidency it will fall to us to determine whether Bt11 should be allowed in. We should refuse to do so. We do not have sufficient scientific research to show whether genetically modified food could corrupt the food chain. I make no apologies if I am treading on corns on this matter as I hold strong beliefs.</P>
    <P>I raised this topic at the EU scrutiny committee, as the vote in Europe had not been scrutinised by either House of the Oireachtas. A major report will return to the committee on this topic. The motion passed stated: &ldquo;that a report be presented to this committee with regard to European legislation concerning genetically modified or novel foods, the extent to which, if any, such legislation has been debated or scrutinised by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or any of its committees, all relevant decisions in this area taken by the European Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health, including all votes by Irish representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Section 11, which defines agricultural products, should exclude genetically modified food. We should state that we will not support the production of genetically modified food products in this country. Section 12 should outline a function of the board to ensure the integrity of Irish food and to ensure that foreign and unproven technologies will not be allowed into our food chain. There has been considerable discussion about identifying food products with a GM label. I have never seen any food products with a big warning label stating, &ldquo;this food is GM&rdquo;. Given the amount of food we import, unbeknown to us traces of GM food may have already crept into our food system. The people do not want Irish farmers producing genetically modified food. I am confident that the Irish consumer does not want to consume genetically modified food.</P>
   
    <P>While congratulating the Minister on introducing the Bill, it affords us ample opportunity to give a statutory expression to our rejection of the whole concept of genetically modified food. Nobody will convince me that putting fish protein into tomatoes will be good. I certainly do not want to eat it and I do not want to legislate so that other people have to eat it. I am not convinced the consumers will have adequate protection or information. Europe should not give in to bullying from the large corporations in the United States of America, which want to impose their will across Europe for their economic purposes. I am against that and I ask the Minister to listen to my plea. I am speaking for many people in this regard. Otherwise, the Bill is an excellent one, which will <Col N="887"/>give added focus to the Irish food industry. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and also on the issue of agriculture, because we seldom get such an opportunity. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh &mdash; these are the only congratulations he will be getting from me &mdash; on appointing my former colleague, Alan Dukes, as chairman of the committee considering the future of agriculture. It shows that the Minister can sometimes recognise a man of significant ability and knowledge of the agriculture sector. As someone who sat on a similar think-tank in the past, I am not too optimistic about what it is likely to do for young farmers on the ground, but I wish it well.</P>
    <P>Many Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers have spoken about the high quality of Irish industry. There is no doubt that we have some of the best producers at every level. Only this week we witnessed the success in Brussels of the Irish Holstein breeders, who won as many prizes as possible, including that of overall show champion. This proves we are among the best in the industry and have some of the best and most efficient producers. Otherwise we could not have competed.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that the food industry has changed and become more international over the last ten years. I can remember a time when we were not even in the EEC, yet we were exporting to America and many other places. The food industry has been on top of things through the years, using every possible avenue to promote and sell its products. In those days there was no intervention scheme. The meat factory in Leixlip, which was owned by farmers at that time, produced high-quality products to be sold at a premium price in British supermarkets. They used every part of the animal, even producing corned beef. I wonder whether corned beef is produced here today. Perhaps it is all being imported from Argentina. We must not forget that we inherited a good industry many years ago and maximised the jobs available in the slaughter industry as well as the live industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that we need to focus on efficiency, competitiveness and market orientation to make the most of sales opportunities, which is something with which I agree. He says his aim is to assist the industry in addressing these challenges, but I question this. We need only consider the Minister&rsquo;s record over the last number of years in increasing the budget for Bord Bia. I must state at this point that I have an interest in the organisation as I was a member of Coras Beostoic agus Feola as a producer representative for seven years. I am also a dairy farmer in my own right. There are challenges we must meet. Will the amalgamation of these two bodies do anything to improve matters? Is it just a cost-cutting exercise or will more money be made available?</P><Col N="888"/>
    <P>It is possible that the Minister did not even know about this &mdash; few people other than Deputy Parlon did &mdash; but under the decentralisation programme, 75 jobs at Bord Bia are going to Enniscorthy. As one involved with the board, I cannot understand that. I thought quite a few Bord Bia jobs were already in foreign offices. Will we be bringing all these people back just to move them to Enniscorthy so that town is given a boost? What will actually happen? The Minister is talking to his Dublin colleague, who has a great interest in Tallaght. Would it not be more logical to move the organisation to somewhere like Tallaght so it would be nearer the centre of activity? Much Bord Bia activity is in sales and marketing and there are many dealings with people who are entering and leaving the country. Is it practical for the meat industry of this country to be represented by an office in Enniscorthy? I have nothing against decentralisation &mdash; I welcome it &mdash; but some elements of it are hard to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the transfer of functions, but since my own group does not agree with this idea, I will not go into detail. However, some interesting comments were made. Since there was not much to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I will not be standing here too long. It was stated that any regulation proposed in the matter of levies on live exports would be laid before the Houses in the normal way. This is a return to the issue of the Minister signing regulations without any discussion in the House, good, bad or indifferent. Many of these regulations were issued during the foot and mouth disease crisis, and the Minister agreed he would be back in the House in 12 months to discuss them. They have never been discussed since, yet they continue to be in effect. I raise this issue purely for the sake of it as I know the Minister will not even listen. He will do his own thing but the manner in which these levies were lifted was not very fair. I welcome the idea of change but that is something, along with the whole question of the live industry, that should be discussed in the House in a proper way.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned subsidiary companies. I do not fully understand what this is all about. Does it mean he will be setting up companies to deal in meat or vegetables? One person did attempt this years ago, during my time in the IFA and CBF. At that time, when we were dealing with many European structures, there was an opportunity to do this. Perhaps in the Minister&rsquo;s reply he could go into this further.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>I will consider a few aspects of the industry and its future. The mushroom industry has been represented by Bord Glas. Earlier speakers said that the amalgamation of the two boards would open up new markets in this area and that the expertise of Bord Bia would add to Bord Glas. There is certainly a long way to go and much work to do. There has been a drop of &euro;11 million in mushroom exports in the last 12 months. There were roughly 1,000 growers up to a couple of <Col N="889"/>years ago, but there are now around 300 and the numbers are still dropping. There is no doubt the mushroom industry is under severe pressure. Can the Minister give me a guarantee that every effort has been made to ensure that no mushroom carrying an Irish label has been produced anywhere else? I have reason to believe that mushrooms from Poland and other areas may be selling as Irish mushrooms in some of the markets we have built up over the years. Along with producers, farmers in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan worked hard to build up that industry.</P>
    <P>As one of the previous speakers said, he had not realised how important agriculture is to the nation. The main product in this country&rsquo;s vegetable exports is mushrooms, and two thirds of those are produced in County Monaghan. It is strange that, while Ireland&rsquo;s production numbers have decreased, the 200 growers in Northern Ireland have remained in business. Major questions must be asked about our efficiency and how we run this industry when so many mushroom growers have gone out of business.</P>
    <P>Poultry production is also under pressure. Again, production in Northern Ireland is increasing dramatically while production in this country is either static or decreasing. What is the reason for that? Have we made the best efforts to sell our product or has there been less promotion? Recently, as a result of the avian flu problem, the Minister was given great credit for introducing new labelling requirements. However, two years ago, I challenged the Taoiseach in the House on that issue because I, with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Food, had visited Chicago and had seen that production constraints were not the same there as here. Undoubtedly, they are not the same in Brazil or Thailand either, while our producers must produce to the highest standards. They are not competing on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>There is no need to say much about pig farming because there are few farmers in that sector. It has, in effect, died out. There are a number of large producers but few ordinary family farms make a living from it. It is interesting to record, however, that, in the period 1982 to 1986, the average price a farmer received for his pigs was 152 cent per pound. In 2004, he receives from 126 to 132 cent per pound. Farmers cannot sustain that type of loss and continue in business.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Eoin Ryan refer to the fact that only eight or nine people work in Bord Glas while there are 12 board members. We will now establish a new board of 12 members within the new Bord Bia structure, so that will not change. It is possible that two of those members will also be on the senior board. I hope the board members will be representative of the producers, processors and those with a thorough knowledge of the industry. These people know what is required and how to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is at a serious crossroads. The Minister has been in office for a long time and has done much good work, but if he considers what is happening in the industry and talks to anybody involved in it, he will quickly realise the <Col N="890"/>extent of the fear and uncertainty. I am aware of one person involved in the industry who has brought together groups of roughly 20 farmers to discuss their future and to find out, from the industry&rsquo;s point of view, what direction they will take. He told me that every meeting is the same. The farmers tell their stories and it is clear that they do not know where they are going. There is the issue of decoupling. Those in the dairying sector wonder if they should sell their quota now or continue in business.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia cannot ignore the dairying sector because it produces most of the product in the meat sector from culled cows and calves. One of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues presented a cup in Virginia last year to the top dairy farmer in this country. The farmer has approximately 140 cows but he says he is getting out of dairying because there is no future in it for him or his family. That is frightening. It is partly because of where he lives and partly because of the situation created by the nitrates directive, slurry accommodation and the uncertainty that has been created. The Minister has agreed there is &euro;1.41 for this year&rsquo;s dairy quota but he has given no indication of what it will be next year. That creates uncertainty. If we allow people of that calibre to leave the industry, what future does it have? Will this be the Minister&rsquo;s legacy or will he clearly state what support he will provide to allow these farmers to provide the 24 week slurry accommodation that is required?</P>
    <P>It is 24 weeks in County Monaghan. Half of the parish of Killanny is in Louth and half is in Monaghan. A farmer told me the other day that he is delighted to be living in County Louth even though half his farm is in Monaghan because he will get away with 16 weeks. Across the river, it is 24 weeks. Is there any scientific basis for that? The third rural environment protection scheme is under threat. It was to be introduced on 1 January but that has not happened. The Teagasc budget has also been cut.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House that farmers need to think wisely and market their products properly. Last year, however, he allowed the budgets for Teagasc, the advisory body that is needed more than ever to advise farmers for the future, and Bord Bia, the promotional body for their produce, to be cut. At the same time, the Minister allowed the grant aid to help farmers restructure their farms to deal with these changes to drop dramatically.</P>
    <P>Every day Members of the House are told what was spent in 1997, when the current parties in Government came into office, in the various Departments and how much is being spent this year. I wish to put on record some figures given to me by the Minister. In 1997, &euro;94 million in grant aid was made available to farmers for farmyard pollution control, dairy hygiene and so forth. Last year, it was &euro;24.9 million at a time when farmers never needed it more. Housing prices have at least doubled in that period but only one third of the grant given in 1997 is available seven years later. This shows how farmers are being supported.</P><Col N="891"/>
    <P>Bord Bia deals with beef products as well as poultry and other produce. The beef industry is most important to this country. Decoupling has been introduced and moneys are now paid directly to farmers. There will be little support through intervention. Hopefully, export refunds will support exports to Russia and other markets. What markets has this Minister opened for producers? I clearly remember sitting on the Government benches behind the then Minister, the former Deputy Ivan Yates. The industry was in a crisis as a result of BSE. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and other Ministers who were then on the Opposition benches told us it was only a matter of getting on an airplane to sort out the beef industry. They promised they could open the Egyptian, Libyan and other markets.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties with BSE and so forth but the only reason Irish producers have received reasonable prices for their cattle is that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK led to a change in regulations and opened new markets to them. The figures make that clear. Are we selling any significant amount of beef to markets outside Europe, aside from the low price beef exports to Russia? We are not. If this new structure is to work, it must be properly financed. The Minister must work at Cabinet to ensure we get a proper budget for Bord Bia so that it can, with the new available market structure, ensure our beef is sold as a premium product at a premium price.</P>
    <P>Another issue, which I hope to have the chance to discuss some other day, is the issue of disease. Two years ago a farmer&rsquo;s stock was bought out as a result of BSE. The farmer was told exactly what to buy in replacement by Department officials. He has now ended up with Johne&rsquo;s disease on his farm, for which he gets no compensation. I beg the Minister to change the regulations with regard to BSE. I ask him not to take out the clean quality animals or force the farmers to replace them with animals with they know not what disease.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Callanan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the previous speaker reminded me of the challenge I face in dealing with this issue. I have not had the opportunity often to speak on matters relating to this particular brief or this particular Minister.</P>
    <P>I suppose I could be sensitive about my inner city background and my rearing in Crumlin, which was a long way from farms and fields. Now I represent Dublin South-West and I am centred in Tallaght. Sometimes people forget there is a farming community in Tallaght. It is not large but it is vibrant above the hills in Bohernabreena. The Minister knows many of the farmers there quite well and has been supportive of them. As an urban based Deputy, I have often pointed out <Col N="892"/>that this Minister has been supportive of my work and efforts to read myself into agricultural issues, issues which Deputy Crawford and other colleagues can rattle on about at ease. I am quite happy to put my hands up in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will paraphrase Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s comments about the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. I think he is a great Minister. Even in urban areas, that is what one hears.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>History will judge him on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>People are proud of the efforts he has made on behalf of the farming community and the people generally. We should not be afraid to say that. As a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher I am proud of the work the Minister does and am happy to applaud him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>He got full support during the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has done his job. Out on the streets, whether in Monaghan or Tallaght, one will find he is popular. That has been my experience.</P>
    <P>I note that the primary purpose of the legislation is, as others have said, to amalgamate Bord Bia and Bord Glas. Bord Bia was established in 1994 and it has had the statutory function of promoting Irish food and drink at home and abroad. Bord Glas was set up in 1990 to improve all aspects of horticulture. Both agencies were the subject of a special review in 1998. At that time it was decided that Bord Glas should be retained as a special agency for the time being but that amalgamation with Bord Bia should be reviewed within five years. Now five years later, it is clear times have changed. Given the economic importance of the industries, what the Government is now doing will get widespread support. However, as with any legislation or proposal there will be lots of dotting the i&rsquo;s and crossing the t&rsquo;s.</P>
    <P>In various contributions I have made on different Bills over my time in the D&aacute;il I have never been afraid to debate the issues and to be constructively critical or, as some might say, helpful. If we read through this legislation or look at the websites of both organisations, we get all sorts of ideas on the issue. I have never been afraid to make it clear I support Government policy while at the same time I attempt to dot the i&rsquo;s and cross the t&rsquo;s. Sometimes &mdash; I am sure Deputy Perry will not do it &mdash; we get a little reaction from Deputies on the other side of the House who do not really understand the role of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers or the democratic process of our large party. We all participate in this manner and ours is a good process.</P>
    <P>This Bill is driven by cost considerations. Looking at the two boards from outside, there is clearly some duplication and an overlap of functions. It is a sensible course to remove the duplication by merging the two bodies. However, other considerations should be borne in mind. People who argue for mergers sometimes forget that business entities have a culture inescapably <Col N="893"/>tied up with their individual identity. A successful identity develops into a team with a driving motivation and collective loyalty of its own. In my little bit of research on this subject I see that both Bord Bia and Bord Glas have an energy and enthusiasm centred and focused on what they are trying to do. I believe, however, that Bord Glas faces a challenge to maintain that focus as part of the larger Bord Bia. I hope Senator Quinn will not mind if I quote from his contribution during the Seanad debate. He stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The main reason some mergers are not successful is that they destroy the essential energy in an organisation. The promised benefits and the expected financial savings do not always result either. We must tread carefully in order to retain the energy, enthusiasm and culture we have seen previously in small organisations.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I said earlier that I have great confidence in this Minister. Therefore, I am quite confident he will take that on board.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my admiration for the achievements of Bord Bia over the years. From my understanding of what it has been doing I cannot but be impressed, as many people are, by its achievements. Agriculture and food are central to Ireland&rsquo;s economy, accounting for 9.2% of GDP, 8.5% of total exports and the employment of 10% of the labour force. The industry incorporates 144,000 family-run farms and 700 companies employing almost 47,000 people. In 2001, the Irish food and drink industry was valued at &euro;16 billion, of which almost &euro;7 billion was exported to over 130 countries worldwide. In excess of 70% of Irish food and drink exports go to markets within Europe.</P>
    <P>Meat and dairy products account for 50% of Irish food and drink exports. More than 80% of Irish dairy production is exported. Irish dairy products are available on all five continents and account for &euro;1.7 billion of Irish food exports. Irish branded butter is the leading branded butter on sale in Germany. Meat accounts for 26% of all Irish food and drink exports. Ireland is the largest net exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere with 90% of Irish beef output exported to some 60 countries worldwide. Two thirds of Irish lamb production is exported, mostly within the EU, with almost 80% destined for the premium French market. More than half of Irish pig meat production is exported to the EU, the US and Japan.</P>
    <P>Prepared consumer foods alone now account for 26% of total Irish food and drink exports, valued at almost &euro;2 billion. Now there is an area for further development by the board on a five year programme. Ireland possesses the fastest and longest ready meals production lines in Europe and is one of Europe&rsquo;s leading suppliers of branded pizzas. It is now Europe&rsquo;s leading supplier of pizza cheese. Three of the world&rsquo;s leading infant formulae companies have chosen Ireland as their European manufacturing base. Irish companies are among the world&rsquo;s leading players in food ingredients technology.</P><Col N="894"/>
    <P>Ireland is also home to some of the world&rsquo;s favourite drink brands, supplying more than 90% of the world&rsquo;s cream liqueur market. Drinks account for 13% of all Irish food and drink exports. This country boasts the world&rsquo;s oldest licensed distillery and the most successful drinks product launched worldwide in the past 30 years. All this information is on the Bord Bia website. Congratulations are due to all involved.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the development of agribusiness over the past three decades. We lost the local co-ops when the major mergers took place. The PLCs then arrived, profit driven with little commitment to local socio-economic needs in rural areas. Recent downsizing and mergers with the resultant job losses are a classic example of this. While the overall benefit to the nation of this consolidation and growth is not in doubt, the cost in rural development should be cause to reconsider. It is necessary to develop a parallel strategy that encompasses what was great about local agri-activity and the successful agribusinesses which contributed to the great achievements to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>In the development plan of Bord Glas, its key horticultural targets for the period 2000 to 2006 were to increase domestic output by &euro;62 million, maintain and increase domestic market share for horticultural produce and increase amenity exports by &euro;10 million. It was estimated that the overall farm gate output of horticultural products would achieve a value in the region of &euro;393 million by 2006. In order to achieve these national targets, projected ongoing capital investments of &euro;127 million will be required in the industry.</P>
    <P>It is important that we support the Minister in every way. At the same time we are entitled to raise questions, and Government backbenchers are no different in this regard. Having said that I have great confidence in the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and we can rest assured that the legislation is in safe hands. What the Bill endeavours to achieve is both well-intentioned and worthy although the issue of its necessity will be the subject of debate for some time. The Government has made a decision and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the development of the horticultural industry under the new Bord Bia banner. It should be brought to its full potential in the coming years. I hope we will have other opportunities in future to support the Government in what is being achieved in this regard. I am happy to concede the remainder of my time slot to my colleague, Deputy Callanan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary purpose of the legislation is to amalgamate Bord Bia and Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>This is important for both the agriculture and horticulture industries. The food and drink industry is one of the few truly indigenous industries and a key driver of the economy in recent years. It is, perhaps, the only indigenous manufacturing sector that has managed to create sufficient scale and expertise to compete on the world stage.</P><Col N="895"/>
    <P>Some 680 companies operate in this sector. The total number of employees in 2001 was over 50,000, which is equivalent to almost 20% of total manufacturing employment in Ireland. As such, it is the single biggest sectoral employer in the Irish manufacturing economy, twice the size of the chemical and pharmaceutical sector. Some 55% of indigenous exports originate from the food and drink sector. The primary agricultural sector employs 114,000 people, giving total employment of almost 165,000 in the combined agrifood and drink sector. This represents 9.5% of the total number of employees in the country.</P>
    <P>In 2002, the agrifood sector accounted for more than 8.4% of gross domestic product. In gross output terms the agrifood sector is valued at &euro;16 billion and exports from the sector totalled &euro;6.7 billion in 2002. Since 2002 the loss of exchange rate competitiveness against the dollar is 41% and almost 16% against sterling. This has made for difficult market conditions for food and drink exporters who sell to over 130 countries worldwide. Irish consumers spent &euro;13.3 billion on food and drink, which is equivalent to 22% of total consumer spending.</P>
    <P>Ireland produces the best beef in the world. Exports of meat and livestock increased by 5% in 2003, to reach almost &euro;2 billion. A strong performance in beef and live animal exports offset declines in lamb and pigmeat exports. Further growth is expected in 2004 due to increased penetration of premium EU beef markets assisted by the absence of intervention stock, a decline in EU production and relatively strong consumer demand. We also anticipate reasonably steady prospects for lamb and pigmeat. The European beef market is now in deficit for the first time in 25 years. Irish beef exporters, responding to the improved demand, marketed a record 415,000 tonnes within the internal market in 2003, a volume never previously approached in the history of the industry.</P>
    <P>The increased focus on Europe is set to continue. The recovery in demand, following the devastation caused by successive BSE scares, is evident in the fact that consumption in 2004, at 7.75 million tonnes, will exceed the previous consumption peak in 1999. The enlargement of the Union from May is set to offer further opportunities. As health concerns switch to obesity, the role of red meat in a healthy and balanced diet is becoming increasingly recognised.</P>
    <P>The recovery in the European beef market over the last two years is remarkable. However, significant challenges remain. The prospective ending of the over 30 month scheme in the UK, possibly in late autumn, could displace 70,000 tonnes of Irish beef exports on an annualised basis. The prospects for the cattle and beef trade as the year progresses are also likely to be affected by any pre-decoupling decisions by producers to reduce cow numbers and to bring forward marketing in advance of the ending of the slaughter premium.</P><Col N="896"/>
    <P>Proposals for EU legislation dealing with the transportation of live animals represent an important issue for the live export trade. The continued recovery in the export of live animals, to 220,000 cattle in 2003, has been an important development for Irish cattle producers. We must ensure that live exports continue. I compliment the Minister for his stand on this issue. Agriculture is in safe hands with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>The challenge from South American imports continues to grow. In the latest GATT trading year, imports of beef from South America into Europe paying full duty are set to almost double, reaching between 100,000 and 120,000 tonnes. Food safety remains at the top of the international food agenda. BSE in the US and avian influenza in both the Asian and American continents highlight the global nature of the meat trade. They also highlight the vulnerability of trade flows to animal disease and concerns about infection migrating to humans. The speed of the response of the EU and national authorities to banning imports of poultry from Thailand, once the issue became apparent, is particularly reassuring. The substantial decline in the incidence of BSE here during 2003 to 183 cases, from 329 in 2002, is similarly reassuring. The continued rise in the age profile of cases points to continued reduction and a positive backdrop to national efforts to regain greater international market access.</P>
    <P>The full implications of CAP reform will depend on the decisions yet to be taken by many member states with regard to the options available to them under decoupling. It is clear, nonetheless, that the performance of the industry in the marketplace will be the key determinant of the future scale and prosperity of the livestock meat sector.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia will this year launch the chef&rsquo;s Irish beef club in three export markets, namely, Britain, France and the Netherlands. It is promoting Irish beef and lamb with more than 30 leading supermarket groups in 3,500 outlets across Britain and the Continent.</P>
    <P>It is important that the dairy industry does not simply stick to the traditional way of producing butter. We must produce what the market wants, which is manufactured dairy products. I compliment Bord Bia on the great work it has done in promoting the food industry. When the two bodies are amalgamated, I am sure they will form a stronger single entity to promote both agriculture and horticulture.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened attentively to Deputies O&rsquo;Connor and Callanan talking about the potential of the market in Ireland. With so many people working in the market, the level of horticulture imports into the country is <Col N="897"/>disappointing because much of this could be developed within the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that Bord Glas, which is involved in an important area of food development, be merged with the larger Bord Bia. While Bord Bia is doing fine work in its defined niche of the food industry, it hardly makes sense to merge Bord Glas with it. I know this was driven by cost considerations and the duplication of work.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry has made a major impact in the economy. Since its inception ten years ago, Bord Glas has successfully worked for the development of the industry. I agree with the points raised by Deputy Upton. Owing to the potential of the horticulture industry, the role of Bord Glas should have been expanded and greater resources given to it. We are all aware of public health concerns. There is much current debate about obesity, diet and health awareness. The level of spending for public health within the Department of Health and Children is minimal. Through effective advertising on RTE and the national press, there is now greater knowledge of horticulture promotions and I hope this is not lost.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia is concerned with the promotion of Irish beef abroad. When one goes to London, it is disappointing to note that Irish beef is not marketed to the same extent as, for example, Scottish beef. It is regrettable that Bord Bia has been unsuccessful in having an &ldquo;Irish produce&rdquo; label attached to such products. Perhaps supermarket chains do not want to use them.</P>
    <P>The value of the horticulture market to the economy in 2002 was &euro;2.3 billion, of which fresh produce accounted for &euro;1.9 billion. This is a growing market and its success should be commended. The Minister has clearly done a good job within the Department. Coming from a background in retail, I know the importance of promotion. The market has changed considerably; one need only look at the frozen and pre-prepared foods markets. Bord Glas has played an important role in predicting future market demands, especially in this time of rapid consumer change.</P>
    <P>In its recent report, Bord Glas highlighted the tremendous changes that face the horticulture industry. More Irish families now eat out and there is increasing competition for food staples such as potatoes and vegetables from non-traditional foods such rice and pasta. The demand for pre-prepared organic produce has increased due to the growing health concerns in the sector. It is important that the Minister closely supervises the activities of Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing within the home market. I have seen some of Bord Bia&rsquo;s effective food promotions. The horticulture board has also done this. We must build awareness with the home consumer. It is important that the board the Minister appoints is tuned into concepts of retailing. It is important that the board be focused on every niche market and it should seek to promote produce in every small town and village. It should also promote the advantages of healthy diets in schools. These changes present an unprecedented challenge to <Col N="898"/>the horticulture sector. Producers and wholesalers will need advice on how to cope with these changes. So far, the sector has risen to the challenge presented by new market demands.</P>
    <P>Decoupling will soon be introduced. With the amount of land that will now be available to alternative enterprises, it is important that the Department gives every encouragement to people to set up such enterprises. With the dependence on REPS cheques, farming is becoming a therapeutic pastime for many people. Nonetheless, it is important to encourage enterprise. The new body should adopt consumer-driven and market-led policies.</P>
    <P>The sales of pre-prepared and chilled horticulture products increased by 20% in 2002. Bord Glas should be given a good share of the credit for this. It has done all it could to provide the necessary back-up and support to the horticultural sector. This system of support should continue in future. This will be impinged upon with the absorption of Bord Glas into Bord Bia. Perhaps the Minister will outline how he will empower the new body and what resources it will have. What will be its focus? Will it be driven through a home market or an external market? What supports will be given to support new entrants to the market? In light of the country&rsquo;s massive land bank, it is important that encouragement be given to generic, home market businesses.</P>
    <P>I had the occasion of going to the Dublin market yesterday. I saw containers of produce coming to it from all over Europe. It is a huge loss to our economy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because of bad marketing techniques by the Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The consumer is often driven by French or Dutch products. It is important that we can say our product is equally good and that we can compete in that market. Home marketing can often make that case. With Bord Bia, the level of promotion we have seen recently on RTE has been quite effective. That should very much be encouraged, as the level of convenience food is now such that people want washed lettuce and diced tomatoes. That is how far they are going. The issue is the value added to the product the customer now demands. People are quite prepared to pay for that too, so there is a huge market for added value products, which also creates a significant number of jobs.</P>
    <P>Bord Glas has also worked closely and co-ordinated its work programmes with other State organisations, most notably with Teagasc. I know Teagasc has been very effective in its support to farmers, whom it has encouraged. It is important in that tie-up that the Minister incorporate Teagasc into the marketability of the re-launch of this agency. It is important that he provide a new focus. We will see massive changes to Teagasc too, and it is critically important that all the sectors from the whole agricultural family be involved on the board. Those close relationships have resulted in important regulations and standards in the horticultural industry, as well as <Col N="899"/>the enactment of a policy to inform and direct State investment in horticulture. That critical investment is also very important.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in small enterprises. Not all the jobs that we have seen are the 365 State jobs. People must be given that enterprise culture, and in the enlarged European Union we should not only be seen as a population base confined to north Dublin, which is very much a growers&rsquo; centre. We should be encouraging potato growers and vegetable growers across the country where they have a good product. We have seen that very clearly with the mushroom industry, which has also been very competitive.</P>
    <P>We have been informed that no significant financial implications arise from this Bill. That said, it is hard to believe that the budget has allowed for cutbacks in spending on key support services in the horticulture industry such as Teagasc, a very important area. We have seen cutbacks; we had the Teagasc board before the Committee of Public Accounts. We also had the closure in Leitrim. We met the Secretary General of the Department. There were obviously cutbacks there, and in many ways Teagasc may not have moved with the times regarding the level of services provided, and not just to farming communities. However, one should spread one&rsquo;s net more widely than simply to farmers, namely those who have extra time on their hands. Farming is very much a part-time occupation in the west of Ireland. Clearly, I am a great supporter of the level of encouragement by Teagasc. The 2003 budget cut its funding by &euro;15 million, and in 2004, the sum will be &euro;5 million. Those are considerable cuts in Teagasc&rsquo;s budget, and they will clearly have an impact. The farming community is becoming concerned at new challenges facing the agricultural sector. It has professed fear for its livelihood, and many fear they may have to get out of the industry. Farming is very much a therapeutic pursuit.</P>
    <P>By merging one of their support outfits into a larger body, the Government is ignoring its concerns and reducing services. That is clearly an issue. When one sees Enterprise Ireland and other critical services promoting home industry and creating jobs, one sees it is a marketing tool for the industry &mdash; Bord Bia and Bord Glas &mdash; in a very critical area of growth. It has huge potential for horticulture as an alternative farming enterprise. It is in many ways regrettable that it is not receiving further promotion. I hope that it does not get totally lost inside Bord Bia as that board is mainly driven by marketing. The horticultural body was very much active in production supports, the focus of which is distinctly different. While Bord Bia was not effectively involved in the production line, Bord Glas was involved in the horticultural sector from the bottom up. I hope the sector in question will not be lost.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not guarantee that the sector to which Bord Glas provides support and services will continue to receive the current level of attention. If and when the amalgamation occurs, the Bill provides for a proposal to appoint a <Col N="900"/>subsidiary board, which is to be welcomed. I would like to know the Minister&rsquo;s plans for that other board and whether it will be focused on horticultural interests specifically or be an amalgamation of the two areas. One hopes it will have a balanced membership to represent the industry in its entirety. That is very important, and if the funding and staffing levels are to remain the same, it is hard to see the logic of the integration. Bord Glas has provided the horticultural sector with an invaluable service, and it would be a shame to see it dissolved into a larger body, where it may lose some of its ability to continue this service.</P>
    <P>From a retailing point of view, growth in the sale of fruit and vegetables is a key aspect. Some of the larger supermarkets in the country, which I will not name here, import a considerable proportion of their produce from abroad ready for sale.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Shameful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in many ways regrettable. We are talking about the creation of jobs. We have mentioned the 165,000 people involved in the food sector. There is currently very little in the way of Government aid or grants available to set up a small company in Ireland. Unfortunately, that work is now left to the enterprise boards in each county, and we know how little funding they get. Their task is to give support to small companies with between one and ten employees. The service sector in this country receives little or no support.</P>
    <P>Given that level of support to small industry, the loss of any marketing tool to small companies is a blow. To date, small industry has received very little from the State. Large oaks grow from small acorns; it is all done by sheer determination, hard work and grit. People talk about a 40-hour week, but most people in the private sector work a 40-hour weekend. For anyone setting up a horticulture enterprise, and particularly in the mushroom business, the level of hard work from the owner or manager is very high. Nothing beats the eye of the boss in any business. It demands, especially in a small company, that the proprietors remain on hand to supervise the management structure.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is in many ways regrettable that any facility for State support such as Bord Glas or Bord Bia should go. They should be there to help people. However, we find in many cases that enterprise boards also stand back. They expect all the risk to be taken by the developer. Unfortunately, they do not get involved, sitting down with the developer and clearly indicating how best they might promote and market that business to make it successful. I hope the marketability and product potential of the horticulture sector will not be lost through this amalgamation. I felt that Bord Bia had an entirely different remit, to do with marketing the food sector. It will be critically important to see the level of cash provision. The briefing note I received indicated that the Bill dealt with the <Col N="901"/>transfer of the current functions of Bord Glas in their entirety to Bord Bia and a comprehensive definition of &ldquo;horticulture&rdquo; to include amenity and agriculture.</P>

    <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. Not only is the loss of 100 jobs in CG Services in my constituency a matter of concern, but the closure of the company sends out a signal with regard to industrial policy in the area and job security in the constituency. The announcement comes in the wake of a number of similar announcements in the Cork region, including job losses in Schering Plough in Brinny, the closure of the Irish Distillers bottling factory in North Mall with the loss of 40 jobs and ongoing job losses in the Dairygold co-operative.</P>
    <P>The common factor in all these cases is that they involve companies which are either based in my constituency or employ my constituents. Through the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, I want to make the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment aware that it is not good enough for my constituents to hear Government representatives discuss the ongoing employment problems in complacent terms. We regularly hear that we have full employment, yet only this week a F&Aacute;S labour force survey found that job growth in 2004 will be the slowest since 1992 and more jobs are being created in the public sector than in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Of added concern as regards the jobs lost in CG Services is that the company was a service industry for the pharmaceutical industry in Cork, a significant employer in the region. We have been consistently led to believe that this sector is recession proof. Combined with recent job losses at Schering Plough in Brinny, the announcement sends out a clear signal that something is amiss in the sector and in the Government&rsquo;s reliance on locating many pharmaceutical industries in my constituency and the Cork region in general. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to this and to show concern about these developments, rather than complacently speaking of all being rosy in the garden. Times are changing; people are losing jobs, job security is increasing and there is considerable uncertainty about those who do not have jobs. The Government has a duty to respond quickly and appropriately to address the uncertainty among many people who are facing unemployment.</P>
    <P>On another level, the manner in which the jobs in question were lost creates more uncertainty, particularly with regard to notice periods and <Col N="902"/>subsequent pension entitlements. Despite the introduction in recent years of a range of Acts aimed at enhancing the rights of workers, particularly when they lose their jobs, people are still falling through the net and being made redundant in unacceptable circumstances. Some are finding themselves picking up the pieces having failed to secure the rights and entitlements due to them because their employer has been either inefficient or unscrupulous in living up to his or her responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Jobs are being lost in industries which we were led to believe were secure, while workers who have lost their jobs are facing a great deal of uncertainty and are not being appropriately protected by legislation. As the Member for the constituency affected by the most recent job losses, I want the Government to respond proactively and appropriately to announcements of this kind and give some succour by indicating that there will be no further job losses in the pharmaceutical sector in Cork or the industries which serve it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The T&aacute;naiste is conscious of the adverse effects on the workers of the decision by CG Services, Ballycurreen Industrial Estate, Airport Road, Cork, to go into voluntary liquidation. She understands that many of the workers have been with this long-established company for more than 20 years.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste understands that the closure of CG Services is attributed to increased competitive pressures, a downturn in markets and other factors. CG Services provided electrical and instrumentation services and developed into one of the largest regional companies in the sector, offering a wide range of services, including electrical and instrumentation systems installation and period maintenance. Close attention to customer requirements and specifications were hallmarks of the company, which completed projects for some of Ireland&rsquo;s leading companies, especially in the computer, electronic and pharmaceutical sectors as well as universities and hospitals.</P>
    <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S has met more than 30 of the 49 electrical-instrumentation apprentices in the company with a view to assisting them to complete their apprenticeships with other employers. Arrangements are being made by F&Aacute;S to brief the remaining employees on the range of its services to assist them in securing alternative employment and-or further training opportunities. F&Aacute;S is making available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, job placement, guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs and courses.</P><Col N="903"/>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will continue its efforts to support enterprise development in the Cork area, thus providing the opportunity for former employees of CG Services to find alternative employment. The three principal activities of Enterprise Ireland in this regard are support for companies, infrastructural development and working with third level educational institutions as originators of the new technologies which drive future industrial growth. Enterprise Ireland aided companies employing more than 19,300 people full time in County Cork in 2003, the highest level recorded.</P>
    <P>In 2003, IDA Ireland announced 11 new projects for the Cork area with the potential to create up to 800 new jobs. Highlighting the continuing confidence in the region, four of these new projects were expansions of existing operations, some of which included significant research and development investment. The seven new start-ups announced during the year included activities ranging from manufacturing and international services to high value research and development based activities. There are 134 IDA Ireland assisted companies in County Cork employing approximately 18,000 people, an increase of more than 20% on the 1999 figure.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to actively market the Cork area to potential investors across a range of sectors, including pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, internationally traded services, financial services and information and communications technologies, through its network of overseas offices and project divisions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent F&Aacute;S labour market survey, the organisation forecasts an increase of 11,000 net new jobs in 2004, with estimated total employment of 1.8 million. The F&Aacute;S report predicts that growth in employment this year will come from the private sector and forecasts a strong performance given the recent appreciation of the euro against the dollar, which compares favourably with the rest of the European Union. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is approximately half the eurozone average. The T&aacute;naiste wishes to assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, in co-operation with local interests, will continue to promote actively the Cork area for investment and job creation.</P>

    <sTitle>Special Educational Needs.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. I am also grateful to the Minister of State for coming to the House to address the issue. Drimnagh Castle primary school is a famous school in Dublin located on the Long Mile Road in Drimnagh, Dublin 12. There are currently 13 boys in the school who have been assessed by a psychologist and qualify for resource help under the Department circulars 07/02 and 08/02. As a result of their educational needs, these boys are probably the most vulnerable in the school system.</P><Col N="904"/>
    <P>The school made an application dated 14 April 2003 which comes under the February to August assessment period dealt with by the dedicated team. A reply from this departmental team was expected on 9 December 2003 but no communication has been received. In September of this year, the school will have a further nine boys enrolling who also have been sanctioned for special needs assistance in their existing schools. The current 13 boys have now been waiting for 12 months since they were assessed.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in the context not just of Drimnagh Castle primary school, but of the general issue. I am aware that the INTO and the Department of Education and Children are in negotiations to review the model of providing teaching resources to children with special needs who are included in mainstream primary classes. The review arises from the problems experienced by teachers, schools and the Department in managing the automatic response which has been in place since 1998. The current system has resulted in a significant expansion of teaching and staffing in schools in recent years. It has, however, been criticised for being too slow to respond, overly bureaucratic and hugely demanding of time for all concerned. The Department circular of 24 March indicated that it wished to move to a weighted system of allocation of resource teachers with effect from September 2004. It was stated that this would involve an annual allocation being made to schools based on a predicated incidence of special educational needs within different sized school populations. Such a system would obviate the need for individual applications for resource in respect of individual pupils other than the most exceptional circumstances. In developing a weighted system, regard will also be had to the level of the caseloads of learning support teachers.</P>
    <P>There are different types of educational disabilities. The prevalence of specific learning difficulty is between 1% and 4% of the schoolgoing population; mild general learning disability can affect 1% to 1.5% of the school-going population; there is also borderline mild general learning disability and educational disadvantage and the prevalence of disabilities.</P>
    <P>Although I am raising this matter in the specific context of the Drimnagh Castle primary school, I am informed that 5,000 children have been assessed and are awaiting an allocation of resource teaching. I am not sure if that is the correct figure. I do not wish to be critical of the Government because I understand it is changing the system from the automatic response to a weighted approach. The Department needs to understand that children are growing older and they are missing out on opportunities while this system is being changed. I ask the Minister to urgently implement the new system and to provide the extra resource teaching for these children.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="905"/>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, regarding the matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Drimnagh Castle primary school, Long Mile Road, Dublin 12, currently has the services of one part-time and two full-time resource teaching posts. This school also has the services of a full-time learning support teacher. I can confirm that the Department has received applications for special education needs supports for a number of pupils attending the school in question during the period from 15 February to 31 August 2003.</P>
    <P>SEN applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the applications made by the school concerned, are being considered at present. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to before or soon after the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special educational resource provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SEN provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. The Department of Education and Science is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and Department officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy and I thank him once again for giving me this opportunity to give an update on the current position in regard to the applications for special educational needs resources for the pupils concerned.</P>

    <sTitle>Education Welfare Service.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am requesting guaranteed funding over at least a three-year period for the Carline centre in Balgaddy because it is in a funding crisis at present and its good work needs to be continued. I discussed the subject of educational welfare officers with the Minister for Education and Science and with the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, today. I criticised the slow roll out although the Department argues this roll out is not necessarily crucial.</P>
    <P>Education welfare officers seem to be in position in the RAPID area of north Clondalkin and three officers will begin work shortly. The <Col N="906"/>work needs to be continued. The education welfare officers are in place but one of the centres in which they will be working is in danger. It is not in danger of closure but it is in danger of its services being severely curtailed. I will outline the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Carline centre of learning was set up in 1993. It deals with young people between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Its aim is to provide a stable environment so that job training, skill building and education can take place in a more efficient manner with a higher probability of success. Young people assisted by the Carline centre include early school leavers, teenage mothers, drug and solvent abusers, those with ADHD, those with child protection concerns or those whose parents are separated. Issues facing young people include anti-social behaviour, parental or peer suicide, drug overdose, bullying, anger management or simply the need for secure care.</P>
    <P>It was a tragic event that caused the Carline centre to be established in 1993. A young person was killed in a joyriding accident and the initial goal was to allow young people to become involved with cars. They refurbished cars and then expanded and acquired the current premises in Balgaddy in 1996. It was opened in 1997 by the then President, Mary Robinson. A second building was opened in 2000. The centre has had over 150 referrals since 1997. It offers junior certificate studies, FETAC accreditation and tries to involve young people in mainstream education or employment. It operates exchange programmes such as with Co-Operation North, an access programme and tries to involve young people with drug-free lives and non-custodial care.</P>
    <P>The centre is trying to develop skills for the future in the young people and it is doing a very good job. The people at the centre are not very politically motivated but they called a meeting of public representatives last Tuesday because they were so concerned about the funding shortfall.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, met with them earlier this week yet no apparent clarification was given as to whether the Department of Education and Science or the South Western Area Health Board would provide the funding guarantee. I understand approximately &euro;166,000 comes from the Department and approximately &euro;79,000 from the health board. The Clondalkin drugs task force also makes a contribution. There is a shortfall in 2004 of almost &euro;240,000 which is a significant shortfall because much of the centre&rsquo;s costs relate to staffing. The staff tend to stay because they are very dedicated people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department of Education and Science to consider providing a three-year marginally increased tranche of funding to ensure that the Carline centre can carry out its good work. As we have seen in the case of the 17 year old who was in Balgaddy, then before the courts and who is now back in Balgaddy, there is a need to ensure that vulnerable young people have somewhere to <Col N="907"/>go and have an opportunity to rebuild their lives. The Carline centre is doing an excellent job in my local area of north Clondalkin and Lucan.</P>
    <P>Those involved with the Carline project are not moaners or whingers. They rarely contact politicians, but I was touched by the fact that they invited all local and national representatives to a meeting last Tuesday to show us around. We were presented with a framed portrait as an example of the work done by the students. The non-political nature and dedication of the staff should be considered, as should the need to ensure that the Carline centre&rsquo;s services continue and expand. Will the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Ministers of State, Deputies de Valera and Brian Lenihan, examine ways of increasing the funding made available to the centre? The centre&rsquo;s large shortfall for 2004 should be covered so that those involved in the project do not have to be concerned in 2005 and 2006. Any advice or information that the Minister of State can give in this regard would be useful to me, my constituents and those working in the Carline centre.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Gogarty for raising this issue. The Line project steering committee is an independent organisation based in the community. The Line group operates in a voluntary capacity and is a wholly autonomous organisation. One of the principal aims of the Line project is to bring together the community, parents, State agencies, such as schools, health boards, F&Aacute;S and the probation and welfare service, and the relevant Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to provide a direct and immediate response to assist young people who have dropped out of the education system.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science supports three projects on a pilot basis: the Carline project, the City Motor Sports project and the Phoenix project. The Carline project offers education and job training programmes to young people without training or qualifications for gainful employment and who are at risk of becoming involved in drug and alcohol abuse and crime.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, the Department of Education and Science has provided financial assistance to Carline, Phoenix and City Motor Sports on a pilot basis. Annual increases have been provided since then at levels in line with VEC non-pay norms. <Col N="908"/>The value of the assistance provided since 1998 exceeds &euro;1.3 million. The annual financial assistance provided by the Department of Education and Science is &euro;106,658 to the Carline project, &euro;82,533 to the Phoenix project and &euro;27,934 to the City Motor Sports project. This comprises a sum of &euro;217,125 per year. In addition to this support, a further sum of &euro;51,000 was provided to Carline for minor repair and refurbishment works in 2002. The Department also gives each of the three projects an allocation of tuition hours to cater for specific children.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance provided by the Department of Education and Science in respect of the projects is paid to the relevant local vocational education committee which, in the case of the Carline project, is County Dublin VEC. There is an ongoing need for VEC oversight of activities supported by the Department to ensure that they meet local needs, are effective, that quality assurance measures are in place and value for money is obtained. The continuing financial support for Carline, under its service contract with County Dublin VEC, has regard to the requirement that educational services provided by agencies in the area should be, as far as possible, consistent and complementary with VEC service plans.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that the Department of Education and Science will renew financial support in 2004 for the projects through the VEC at existing levels. No absolute guarantee of financial support in future years may be given at this time, however. It is essential to develop school based measures to address the problems of such children and to prevent alienation from the mainstream system rather than developing alternative education provisions. Most school based interventions being developed are preventative in nature. If support for the Line project is to continue until 2006 on a pilot basis, an evaluation by the VEC of its impact on the problems of the current cadre of disaffected young persons will be required. This will allow a reasonable timeframe for the effects of the preventative school based measures being developed in mainstream education to become effective and to be assessed. If these latter initiatives prove successful, the school based measures being developed could be expanded, thereby reducing the need for further out-of-school projects to be supported.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, affordability and difficulties under EU rules surrounding the treatment of public private partnerships in Government accounting had adversely effected the Cork School of Music project. The Government is committed to addressing the country&rsquo;s infrastructural deficiencies and PPPs are seen as a significant means of advancing the programme to tackle these deficiencies. In light of the decision announced by EUROSTAT last week to amend the guidelines on the treatment of PPPs in Government accounts, the Government has begun to look again at projects that had been delayed as a result of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Cork, the Taoiseach re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to finding a solution to the accommodation problems at the Cork School of Music, CSM. My Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, is now reviewing the CSM project, taking into account the new EUROSTAT guidelines and I hope that a decision on the project can be made in the very near future.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the plans that are in place to increase the number of second level school places in the Lucan area over the coming 12 to 18 months, particularly in relation to the development of Adamstown, which has already seen its first planning applications.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5218/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four post primary providers operating in the Lucan area. In total, the four schools currently provide 2,420 places. In the past five years, all four post primary schools have shared in a massive and sustained capital investment programme of almost &euro;7 million, which has significantly boosted capacity and substantially improved facilities. This &euro;7 million has been in addition to an investment of &euro;12 million in primary schools in the Lucan area. <Col N="910"/>Accordingly, over the past five years, a sum of &euro;19 million has been invested in providing and upgrading educational provision in Lucan. As a direct result of this investment, Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig will in 2004 benefit from the completion of a major extension project which will increase capacity at the school by 300 pupil places.</P>
    <P>In addition, a project to provide a new building for Col&aacute;iste Cois Life will also proceed to tender and construction this year. This will provide places for 600 pupils, some 400 additional places relative to existing capacity. A third school, St. Joseph&rsquo;s college, will have its major extension project completed this year also which will provide an overall capacity of 725 pupil places. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area.</P>
    <P>On foot of this unprecedented level of investment in schools in the Lucan area, pupil places will be increased overall by 25% over a period of five to six years. I am confident that the Deputy will accept that this represents a very clear commitment on behalf of the Government to deliver educational infrastructure in areas that are recognised as rapidly developing.</P>
    <P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the reality that enrolments in post primary schools in the immediate Lucan hinterland have shown a decline in the past five years. Almost 500 pupil places are available between these schools which can be used to alleviate any difficulties in Lucan should the need arise. I am satisfied that the massive capital investment in the Lucan area will ensure that the demand for post- primary school places will match supply well into the future. However, my Department will continue to monitor developments to ensure that any emerging additional demands are addressed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>On the proposed development of the Adamstown strategic development zone, the Deputy will appreciate that this development is an entirely separate entity from Lucan. It has its own educational infrastructural requirements which have been carefully mapped out by the local authority in consultation with my Department. The Deputy will be aware that the phased delivery of the development, as endorsed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is specific in terms of targeted delivery for infrastructure including schools. My Department is working with the local authority and the developers to ensure that emerging needs in Adamstown are addressed commensurate with the development of the area.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if any progress has been made in relation to transferability of pension entitlements arising from years of teaching service in Northern Ireland and the Republic; and the position regarding the reports from the joint working group on teachers superannuation which was established by a decision of the North-South Ministerial Council four years ago.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The joint working group on teachers&rsquo; superannuation is continuing to examine the feasibility and implication of establishing reciprocal arrangements to facilitate the transfer of pension entitlements between the jurisdictions. The working group is very much aware that the superannuation of teachers cannot be considered in isolation and that any proposals for the transfer of pension entitlements will have to take account of the implications for the public service generally.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the North-South Ministerial Council, which established the group, decided at its plenary meeting on 28 June 2002, that a broad-based working group should be set up to consider the question of superannuation generally, including the mobility of pension rights not only between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland but between this jurisdiction and the wider United Kingdom. This decision, which was taken following consideration by the council of a report on the study of obstacles to cross-Border mobility on the island of Ireland, has not yet been implemented due to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>In light of the ongoing suspension of the Assembly the joint working group on teachers&rsquo; superannuation decided to continue its work on the basis that this will assist the work of the wider pensions forum when it is established. Having considered the many complex issues involved, the working group has requested the actuaries on both sides to examine the financial implications of the possible approaches to cross-Border transfer of teaching service. In considering the question, the actuaries are taking into account such matters as the exchange rate, price inflation, earnings escalation and salary scales. It is expected that the report by the actuaries will be available to the working group in the next month or so.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if his Department has received correspondence in relation to the guidelines issued to NEPS psychologists for the assessment of children with special needs; if the reasoning behind such guidelines is wholly financially based; if it intentionally or unintentionally compromises the professional standing of educational psychologists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5220/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department receives a large volume of correspondence and telephone calls in regard to the allocation of additional resources to children with special educational needs. I am glad therefore to clarify the matter. My Department has issued no guidelines to NEPS psychologists on the assessment of children with special educational needs. The nature of such individual psychological assessments, in terms of the test instruments used and the recommendations to schools, is a matter for the psychologists conducting the assessments.</P>
    <P>Psychological assessment reports normally include recommendations as to the individual programmes to be followed by the assessed children. In many cases, the psychologists find that additional resources are needed if the recommended programmes are to be implemented. In conjunction with circular letters 7/02 and 8/02, my Department has issued guidelines for all professionals who may be involved in assessing children, including NEPS psychologists, on the levels of additional resources that may be allocated to the different categories of disability. These guidelines are based on the recommendations in the report of the special education review committee, 1993, which drew on extensive national and international research and review of practice and provision at that time. The guidelines were drafted in 1999, without reference to financial constraints, and have not been changed since.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Special Education has, as part of its remit, a review of the levels of resources appropriate to different disabilities. Pending this development, NEPS psychologists implement the Department&rsquo;s current guidelines on resource allocation and usually recommend accordingly, certainly in regard to initial allocations.</P>
    <P>It has become clear over the past year that certain professional reports from outside the Department have recommended resources above the parameters laid down in Department <Col N="913"/>circulars. I, therefore, asked the NEPS psychologists to read these reports and to advise me as to whether or not the children concerned were eligible for additional resources according to the criteria in circulars 7/02 and 8/02. I wish to make it clear that they were in no way questioning the professional findings of their colleagues, but were merely stating whether the assessment data provided conformed to the criteria.</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, a NEPS psychologist may arrive at a professional judgment that a child would benefit from resource levels above or below those set out in the guidelines. In such cases, the psychologist will so recommend to my Department which takes the final decision. These arrangements do not compromise the professional standing of NEPS psychologists.</P>

     <Quest>when he expects to publish the promised regulations under the Education Act 1998 to govern admission to primary schools, especially in view of claims made in the report of the National Forum on Primary Education that a number of primary schools were discriminating against poorer and weaker pupils in their enrolment and admission policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Officials in my Department are in continuing consultation with officials in the <Col N="914"/>Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. This work will be concluded as speedily as possible. The purpose of these proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equality and participation in education.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in regard to a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 80 together.</P>
    <P>The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003. The report indicates that approximately 12,500 &mdash; 18.2% &mdash; young people leave school annually without the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>The latest information published in the NESF report 2002 on early school leaving estimated that between 700 and 1,000 young people do not transfer from primary to second level. My Department is currently completing analysis work for the development of a primary pupil database, which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates from primary to post primary level in the future. The problem of early school leaving is complex and addressing it requires action on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions. This is the approach that my Department is taking.</P>
    <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies to promote regular school attendance, tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The board is developing a nationwide service which is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others who are concerned with the welfare of young people. It has announced the establishment of five regional teams with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and the availability, for the first time, of an educational welfare service in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny and in 13 towns, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. The total staff complement of the board is 84.</P>
    <P>With regard to curriculum reform, my Department&rsquo;s strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation and training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school <Col N="916"/>leaving. The focus of the school completion programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
    <P>There are also five youth encounter projects, YEPs, three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick, which are supported by my Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten to 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should lead to increased numbers of young people completing second level education and in that way most effectively assist in addressing the problem of early school leaving.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>

	<P>A project at St. Killian&rsquo;s junior national school in Tallaght is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The project is linked to and being progressed as part of a project at St. Killian&rsquo;s senior school since both schools are located on the same campus. The project at the junior school consists of renovations to the school, roof repairs, fencing and associated works. Crucially, there is no deficit of classroom accommodation at either schools and, accordingly, the project has been assigned a band three priority rating.</P>
    <P>In selecting projects to expend the additional &euro;30 million allocated on budget day, schools were chosen on the basis of their band rating and the need to replace poor quality existing accommodation and/or the ability of the projects in question to draw down funding during 2004. Since none of these criteria applied in the case of St. Killian&rsquo;s junior national school, the project was not included.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the multi-annual allocations for capital investment in educational infrastructure covering the years 2004-08. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 capital programme will be reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual programme from 2005 onwards. St. Killian&rsquo;s junior school will be included in this review. The outcome of the review will be the subject of a further announcement later in the year.</P>

	<P>At its meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, the European Council agreed a strategic target for Europe to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. An established priority for Ireland, as part of this wider EU objective, is to create a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure. An EU target of 3% of GDP spend on research and development by 2010 was subsequently established by the European Council at its meeting in Barcelona in 2002. I am aware of the significant implications of this commitment for the number of researchers required in Ireland, both in industry and in the higher education and state agency sectors.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, unprecedented levels of investment are now being made in research and development across a range of research programmes. In this regard, the Government has committed &euro;2.5 billion to research, technology, innovation and development under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Since 1998, the commencement of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, the establishment of the two research councils and the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland have been particularly important developments. This investment has opened up major new opportunities for Irish researchers and for the attraction of researchers to Ireland from overseas.</P>
    <P>The attraction of leading overseas post graduate, post doctoral and senior researchers into the Irish system is a key strategic issue for Ireland over the coming years as our domestic output of graduates and post graduates will not be sufficient to meet the demands for researchers made by our current investment in research and development and by the achievement of the Barcelona target. The challenges around attracting and retaining researchers have recently been considered on a joint basis by the Higher Education Authority and Forf&aacute;s. The mobility of researchers within the European research area is also the subject of a current Commission communication and Ireland is supporting efforts aimed at improving researcher mobility in support of the broad goals of the Lisbon strategy. Overseas researchers are already being recruited in significant numbers under the programme for <Col N="918"/>research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s funding programmes. In this context, an agreement was concluded between the Government and universities in 2003 that fast tracks work permits for researchers coming to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work with research agencies and the research community in Ireland in addressing all of the issues associated with achieving the Barcelona target. In this context, a high level interdepartmental steering group is now at an advanced stage in agreeing a national action plan for this purpose.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I would like to clarify that my announcement of 5 January 2004 referred to the manner in which key decisions are taken concerning school provision generally rather than an overhaul of the school building programme. However, the experience of publishing an annual school building programme has reinforced my very strongly held convictions that all key decisions relating to educational infrastructure should be made in an open and transparent manner. For these reasons, I am introducing a new model for planning school provision.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the new model, which I am introducing initially on a pilot basis, is the publication of area development plans. This process will begin with the publication of a draft plan, which the school planning section of my Department will draw up. The draft plan will detail existing primary and postprimary provision in an area. Cognisant of the demographics of an area, it will assess and comment on the ability of existing provision in the area to meet the challenges of a changing educational landscape for a minimum period of ten years.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the draft development plan, the commission on school accommodation will conduct a public engagement process in which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process will culminate ultimately in the publication of a development plan for an area. This plan will be a public document and will be the basis against which all capital funding decisions for the area will be made.</P>
    <P>The new model will be piloted in five areas initially during the current year. As I have already said, the principle underpinning the approach is the need for openness and transparency. All interested parties should have a say in how schools are configured and where they are located. This approach permits the public at <Col N="919"/>large to engage fully in the school planning process.</P>

	<P>At present 128 institutions are listed on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children&rsquo;s homes and special schools, in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.</P>
    <P>My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory or inspection function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was limited due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time consuming and is continuing. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of its evaluative role, my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate conducted a sample survey in late 2002 of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</P>
    <P>While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, the report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</P>
    <P>Arising from the findings in the report, all applications for special educational resources are subject to individual verification. In addition, my Department is reviewing the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In this context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome. I can confirm, however, that the basic purpose of that review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P><Col N="921"/>
    <P>Pending the conclusion of discussions with the representative interests, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 30 together.</P>
    <P>The OECD report to which the Deputies refer is based on an international survey of second level schools carried out in the period November 2001 to May 2002 across 17 OECD countries. Some 255 Irish school principals participated in the survey. While the survey portrays Irish second level schools as having an average pupil to computer ratio of 13:1, substantial additional funding has been provided for schools&rsquo; ICT since the survey was undertaken resulting in further reductions in pupil to computer ratios in Irish schools. In late 2002-early 2003, the national centre for technology in education conducted a full census of schools&rsquo; ICT infrastructure on behalf of my Department, a key finding of which was that the average pupil to computer ratio in second level schools had fallen to 9.4 :1.</P>
    <P>While significant progress has been made in providing ICT access and support to teachers and students in schools, there is still some way to go before ICT is fully integrated in the teaching and learning process. My Department is currently preparing a new strategic plan which will address a range of issues aimed at enhancing the potential of ICT for the benefit of both teacher and learner, including: provision of networked computer facilities in schools; broadband Internet access for every school in the country; teacher training and support programmes focused on practical ICT applications in the classroom; advancement of ICT as a central teaching and learning tool across the curriculum; development of quality digital content for use in the curriculum; promoting a participative e-learning environment within the school; industry-school collaboration on ICT issues; and evaluating the impact of ICT at school level.</P><Col N="922"/>
    <P>In regard to the OECD survey&rsquo;s findings on hiring teachers, it should be understood that two sets of questions were asked in this regard the first related to the principal&rsquo;s perception as to the difficulty of hiring qualified staff across a range of disciplines, the second to experience of how teacher vacancies were actually being filled and by whom.</P>
    <P>While Irish principals responded to the first question by expressing that it was difficult to find fully qualified teachers in specific disciplines, in regard to the second question the overwhelming majority of schools reported that vacancies were being filled by fully qualified teachers. This means that while principals perceive a particular difficulty in finding fully qualified staff or indeed that it is becoming a more difficult task, they are still managing to do so in a huge majority of situations. In fact, the findings in the Irish situation show that we have the highest filling of vacancies by qualified staff of all countries polled in the survey.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has operational responsibility for the certificate examinations. The allocation of points to particular grades is a matter for individual third level colleges in collaboration with the Central Applications Office in accordance with their admission strategies. While the majority of courses attract points under the common points system, this is not true in all cases. Accordingly I consider it more appropriate that the calculation of points should continue to be a matter, which falls within the remit of the Central Applications Office.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the issue of bullying in schools, in all of its forms, including homophobic bullying very seriously and my Department and I are strongly committed to removing all barriers to full participation in education, including barriers caused by the sexual orientation of students.</P>
    <P>Recent education legislation and equality legislation have among their key objectives the promotion of equality of access to and participation in education and the prevention of discrimination on nine specified grounds, including sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>As part of its ongoing response to this issue, in September 2003 my Department published a pamphlet called, Schools and the Equal Status Act. This outlines the main features of equality legislation as they affect primary and second-level schools and identifies ways in which equality legislation can be used as building blocks for the creation of the inclusive school. The Department in 1993 published guidelines on countering bullying behaviour.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of programmes and guidelines address diversity and equality from different perspectives, including sexual orientation. These include the SPHE, CSPE, RSE and exploring masculinity programmes. In SPHE work has been done on combating bullying and name-calling and this will have a positive knock-on effect on sexual orientation. In RSE, modules on sexuality have always formed part of the programme. Recently a two day inservice training programme has been provided to address sexual orientation and sexual health. The exploring masculinity programme is being currently reviewed and I await recommendations regarding future directions in this area. The NCCA is currently preparing guidelines on equality proofing which should assist schools as they deal with equality issues, including sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The National Education Welfare Board also has codes of behaviour that include the nine grounds of equality, including sexual orientation. Recommendations for further action have also been made in reports by the Equality Authority, Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals, and the NESF, Equality Policies for Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual People: Implementation Issues. I have welcomed these recommendations. I am conscious that more <Col N="924"/>needs to be done in schools and colleges to meet the specific concerns relating to the homophobic bullying of students on grounds of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The central policy unit in my Department is addressing this issue and has had discussions with representatives from the gay, lesbian and bisexual community as well as the different sections in the Department involved in primary and post-primary education and with representatives from the relevant programmes and agencies. The aim of the deliberations has been to determine a best way forward in dealing with sexual orientation. The central policy unit is currently finalising a report of the deliberations, which will be provided to my Department&rsquo;s management advisory committee shortly.</P>

	<P>The leaving certificate applied, LCA, is one of the options of the senior cycle structure. The programme has been introduced on a phased basis since 1995, when it was initially offered to 1,200 students in 50 schools and centres. There are currently more than 8,000 students studying under the programme in more than 300 schools and centres.</P>
    <P>An intensive support service to assist with the introduction of this innovative and distinct programme into the Irish second-level education system was put in place in 1995. This service, dedicated solely to the LCA programme, was continued for a significant number of years, up to the end of the last school year. The LCA programme is, at this stage, well established in the Irish education system.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the present school year in-service training and support for the LCA programme has been provided by the broader second level support service. This service provides inservice and support for a number of second level programmes as well as the LCA. For well established programmes this arrangement enables best use to be made of the expertise that has been developed and built up over a number of years and can be shared and utilised in a number of different but related areas.</P>

	<P>The planning group that reported in September 1998 on the need for a National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, recommended a target number of 200 psychologists. This figure was inclusive of the psychologists already working in my Department and elsewhere in the educational system. The indications at that time were that this would necessitate the recruitment of 131 additional psychologists to NEPS. The planning group also recommended that this target should be attained over a development period of five years.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the recommendations of the planning group and issued a decision in February 1999 that included a plan for the phased recruitment of psychologists and administrative staff to NEPS. Recruitment by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission of additional psychologists for NEPS began later that year. Some 43 serving psychologists employed by my Department plus three on career breaks transferred to NEPS on 1 <Col N="926"/>September 1999. This included 15 temporary contract posts.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the time consuming aspects of recruiting professional staff, my Department has appointed 93 additional psychologists since 1999 for assignment to NEPS. This includes permanent appointment of those previously on temporary contract. Allowing for retirements, resignations, etc., the total number of psychologists serving in NEPS is 125, plus one on assignment to other duties in my Department. Four other psychologists are on career breaks at present. My Department is also processing offers of employment for a further five psychologists. It is hoped that they will be joining NEPS later during this school year, bringing the overall total, including those on career breaks, to 135. NEPS psychologists and administrative staff are included within the overall staffing complement of my Department. Future recruitment of psychologists must therefore be dealt with in that context.</P>

His report was published on 15 January 2004 together with the review completed by the Office of the Attorney General. Judge Ryan has concluded that a combination of legislative amendments to the original Act and alternative procedures being adopted by the investigation committee would result in the commission being in a position to conclude its work within a reasonable timescale and without incurring exorbitant costs.</P><Col N="927"/>
    <P>The Government has accepted Judge Ryan&rsquo;s report and is arranging for the legislative changes recommended by him to be included in the amending legislation. Any requests for additional resources that the commission may make will be treated as a priority and dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>Two issues in particular need to be taken account of prior to publishing amending legislation. The ongoing litigation involving the Christian Brothers is an issue that needs to be concluded before legislation can be finalised. Judge Ryan in his report states that notice must be taken of the Christian Brothers case and the potential effect of the ultimate judgment in the case on the proceedings of the investigation committee. Judge Ryan states: &ldquo;It is impractical to suggest that there could be amending legislation processed and enacted until the Murray/Gibson (Christian Brothers) litigation is determined&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand that the final version of Judge Abbott&rsquo;s judgment in this matter was issued on 27 January 2004 and that the 21 day period during which parties to that case can decide whether or not to appeal to the Supreme Court has now expired. My Department has been informed by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office that, while the written notification had not yet been received, the solicitors for the Christian Brothers have informed the CSSO that they are going to appeal. My Department will follow this issue up with the CSSO with a view to ensuring, in so far as is possible, that the Supreme Court would hear such an appeal as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Judge Ryan intends to undertake a consultation process with all parties to the commission. It is possible that Judge Ryan will recommend further legislative changes arising from this consultation process and if so any such recommendations for legislative change would have to be considered in finalising the draft Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.</P>
    <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate and educational services together with a further eight head office staff. To date, 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed. This includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service. The board has recently advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies which will bring the total staff complement to 84, including 68 service delivery staff.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home school community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for travellers to be very important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure <Col N="929"/>that all available existing resources are utilised to the full. As I have stated previously, I consider it essential that the board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with the personnel it has at the moment and with the help of other people involved in the area. When this has been achieved, I will consider the position again taking into account the available resources.</P>
    <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving education.</P>
    <P>The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. My Department has recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. An information leaflet and an application form are being prepared for issue to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences and a protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The current approach to tackling the problem of drug abuse in Ireland has developed around the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Central to the approach has been the bringing together of key agencies, both statutory, and community and voluntary, in a planned and co-ordinated manner to develop a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse, not just on the supply of drugs but also in providing treatment and rehabilitation <Col N="930"/>for those who are addicted, as well as developing appropriate preventative strategies.</P>
    <P>On the prevention theme, my Department is committed, in the context of social, personal and health education, to the provision of substance misuse prevention programmes for all pupils in primary and post-primary schools. Social, personal and health education now forms part of the revised primary school curriculum. This area of the curriculum encompasses well-researched and established approaches to the entire area of social, personal and health education as well as to the particular area of substance misuse prevention. It also provides the context for the implementation and ongoing evaluation of the walk tall programmes, which has been researched and developed for this specific purpose and for which ongoing additional support is provided for schools within the local drugs task force areas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, at post-primary level, the introduction of social personal and health education provides the overall context for programmes of substance misuse prevention and for the support service, incorporating the On My Own Two Feet programme, that is in place for this purpose. This support service consists of a national co-ordinator and ten regional development officers and is jointly supported by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Social, personal and health education, including the entire thrust of the substance misuse prevention programmes and associated school policies at primary and post-primary level, are designed to enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will positively inform their decisions and actions not only during their time in school but in their future lives. I am confident that all aspects of the work concerned, both at primary and post-primary level, are positive and productive for the students concerned.</P>

	<P>The 2004 school building programme is a further major step in progressing this Government&rsquo;s consistent commitment since 1997 to deal with school accommodation needs. It details in excess of 200 significant school building projects that are being authorised to proceed to tender and construction in 2004.</P>
    <P>The projects in Roscommon that are listed in the programme for proceeding to tender and construction include primary schools at Ballyforan, Cloonbonniff, Ballanagare and Ballyleague. A further two schools, Grange national school in Boyle and Abbey national school in Roscommon were added to this list as part of the recent allocation of the &euro;30 million additional investment in school buildings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that projects at primary schools in Clooniquin, Roxboro and Ballyfeeney proceeded to construction as part of the 2003 school building programme.</P>
    <P>A number of other projects for schools in Roscommon are at various stages of architectural planning. The details on these projects are listed at sections 8 and 9 of the 2004 programme. As I have previously stated, a key part of my strategy <Col N="932"/>in future will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects covering the years 2004 to 2008. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;31 million has been set aside in the 2004 programme for projects that will be included in the summer works scheme. This is a new initiative for grant-aiding small-scale improvement works that can be carried out in the summer in both primary and post-primary schools.

	<P>There are five children&rsquo;s detention schools under the aegis of my Department. The schools provide residential accommodation for children under 16 years who have been convicted of an offence or remanded in custody by the courts. The five schools currently have a combined operational capacity of 115 boys and 15 girls. The operational capacity may fluctuate from time to time to accommodate refurbishment and new developments, fire, health and safety or security concerns and current child care practices.</P>
    <P>A key consideration for my Department in commencing the Children Act 2001 is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required under the new arrangements. An independent internationally recognised expert in the field of residential care was commissioned by my Department to review the residential requirements for children&rsquo;s detention schools. This review does not envisage any significant change in requirements in the short term. In the medium to long-term the review suggests that with the implementation of the Children Act 2001 and the increasing availability of early intervention measures and alternatives to custody envisaged, there will be a reduction in demand for residential places for young offenders. The views of the Special Residential Services Board on the report were received by my Department and are currently being considered.</P>

	<P>The priorities for the education sector during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council are as follows. There will be two formal Education Councils held in Brussels during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, on 26 February and 27-28 May 2004. The main agenda item for the February Council will be the adoption of the joint interim report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the detailed work programme on the follow-up of the objectives of education and training systems in Europe. There will also be an initial exchange of views by Ministers on the Europass proposal for a single framework for the transparency of qualifications and competencies.</P>
    <P>At the May council, I anticipate that the principal agenda items in the education sector will be the adoption of a Council resolution on guidance in the context of lifelong learning. In addition, there will be conclusions on quality assurance in vocational education and training and on common European principles for the validation of non-formal and informal learning. There will also be a discussion on the new generation of EU education and youth programmes due to commence in 2007.</P>
    <P>In addition to the two formal councils in Brussels, my Department will be holding a wide range of conferences and seminars in Ireland covering issues such as ICT and digital learning, special needs education, vocational training and higher education. I will also host an informal EU ministerial conference on guidance and counselling and a meeting of OECD Ministers for education.

	<P>I welcome the new agreement on parent-teacher meetings which delivers on the commitment required under Sustaining Progress in preserving the integrity of the school year. In future, schools will not have to close either for full days of half days when parent-teacher meetings covered by this agreement are being held. This has proved a serious concern for parents and school management in the past. The other key objective was to make the arrangements more convenient for parents. From now on most parents of post-primary school children will have an opportunity to attend parent-teacher meetings on the way home from <Col N="934"/>work. An essential part of the new arrangements is the agreement that parents waiting to be seen at the formal finish time of 6.45 p.m. will be accommodated within reason. This is preferable to having any defined finish time. Furthermore, arrangements must be made to facilitate parents who, for whatever reason, cannot make the formal meeting at all.</P>
    <P>At primary level tuition time is also secured and a highly parent-friendly model has been agreed that builds on existing good practices within the sector. Parents will be offered an appointment either within the formal period set for the meeting or, where this does not suit the parents, they will be offered a suitable alternative.</P>

	<P>The report, Supporting Equity in Higher Education, was published in August 2003. It was designed to provide options for my consideration in order to promote greater equity in access to and participation in higher education, therefore, maximising the benefits of the substantial investment being made in this area. As the Deputy is aware, on 25 May 2003 I announced a &euro;42 million support package for disadvantaged students in higher education. In constructing this package of measures, I had regard to the various policy options outlined in chapter four of the report which were developed on the basis of their potential to improve equity of access to higher education. In this regard, I am glad to note that the number of students who benefited from the special rates of maintenance or top-up grant in 2002-03 has increased substantially on previous years and I expect that the number of students benefiting from the student support schemes in 2003-04 will involve a significant increase over 2002-03.</P><Col N="935"/>
    <P>On the issue of reviewing the means test for third level grants, the report identified the fairness of the means assessment on which student support is based as being a vitally important issue in promoting equity. It noted that the current system is widely regarded as being inequitable and, in line with earlier reports, concluded that the introduction of a capital test would remove a significant perceived inequity in the system. The report also concluded, in this context, that the administration of the student support schemes needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with our commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, it is my intention to introduce a unified scheme. I also propose to put in place a more coherent administration system which will facilitate the introduction of more sophisticated means testing arrangements and ensure consistency of application and client accessibility as suggested in the report. My Department has commenced discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to establish the extent to which that Department can assist in the streamlining of the administration of the single unified scheme which I intend to establish on a statutory basis to replace existing arrangements. My Department is also in contact with the Irish Vocational Education Committee and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with which it will shortly be holding discussions about the future administration of the student support schemes. When these discussions are concluded, I will be in a position to make a final determination as to the most efficient and effective arrangements for the future administration of the schemes.</P>

	<P>Social, personal and health education has been part of the national curriculum in all primary schools since September 2003. It is delivered to children at all levels from infants upwards. The content of the SPHE curriculum for primary schools was developed as part of the revised primary curriculum introduced in 1999. It provides opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child and to help the child to create and maintain supportive relations and to become an active responsible citizen. The implementation of the new SPHE curriculum in primary schools has been and continues to be supported by the SPHE team within the primary curriculum support service, PCSP.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 71 together.</P>
    <P>In the context of adult education, my Department provides for a range of programmes to support lifelong learning, including adult literacy and community education, the back to education initiative, the education equality initiative, the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and post-leaving certificate courses. These programmes are organised and delivered through the VECs.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of a report of an international adult literacy survey in 1997, my Department has invested considerably increased funding in the development of adult literacy services. Currently, the annual number of clients of the general adult literacy services provided by the VECs is 28,000. The additional funds provided in recent years were used to expand the scale and scope of provision, improve outreach and referral links and promote flexibility and quality. In addition to expanding the general adult literacy services, specially targeted programmes have been introduced for people with special literacy requirements, in such areas <Col N="939"/>as family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs, and catering for those for whom English is not the mother tongue. To try to reach as many people with literacy needs as possible, use is made of radio and television, so that people can access help in the privacy of their own homes.</P>
    <P>The national development plan committed &euro;93.5 million to the service in the period 2000 to 2006, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients over that period. In the area of workplace literacy, joint initiatives have been developed at local level through co-operation between VECs, F&Aacute;S, the National Adult Literacy Agency and local employers. Specific funding has been provided for a course in workplace basic skills training for experienced group literacy tutors. This course is designed to familiarise literacy tutors with the key issues in basic skills training in the workplace and also identifies strategies for introducing and implementing programmes in this context.</P>
    <P>Programmes under way at national level include the return to education programme, a joint initiative between F&Aacute;S, the VECs and NALA, which provides an intensive literacy programme for community employment workers on F&Aacute;S community employment schemes. A focused workplace literacy programme is available nationwide for local authority outdoor staff. There are also successful workplace literacy programmes in two hospitals and in a trade union. The commitment and support of employers is a fundamental requirement for the successful implementation of workplace literacy programmes. In seeking to support and encourage employers to participate in such programmes, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a project proposal from NALA to design and deliver a workplace basic education programme for SMEs. A pilot programme for the development of a certificate in workplace skills has also been approved by that Department under the ESF-aided in-company training measure of the human resources development operational programme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Responsibility for implementing the Act lies with three Departments: my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the <Col N="940"/>Department of Health and Children. The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, with the support of the National Children&rsquo;s Office, is leading the interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the phased implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>My Department has sole responsibility for the provision of residential services for children up to age 16 who have been convicted or placed on remand by a court. There are five schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department providing such services. The schools are governed by the terms of the Children Acts 1908 to 1989, which will be replaced by the Children Act 2001 when the provisions of the latter are commenced.</P>
    <P>My Department has responsibility for Part 10 of the Act, which provides for the establishment of children&rsquo;s detention schools to replace the existing reformatory and industrial schools. These provisions cannot be commenced until separate detention facilities are provided for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls. Part 11 of the Children Act 2001 provides for the special residential services board, which was established on a statutory basis on 7 November 2003. Part 11 is jointly the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science and its functions are to provide policy advice to the Ministers on the remand and detention of children and ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children&rsquo;s detention orders or special care orders are made. To facilitate the appointment of the special residential services board, section 159(1) of the Children Act 2001 was partially commenced to allow for the membership of representatives of the children&rsquo;s detention schools.</P>
    <P>A key consideration for my Department in commencing the Children Act 2001 is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required under the new arrangements. An independent internationally recognised expert in the field of residential care was commissioned by my Department to review the residential requirements for these detention schools. This review does not envisage any significant change in requirements in the short term. In the medium to long term the review suggests that with the implementation of the Children Act 2001 and the increasing availability of early intervention measures and alternatives to custody envisaged, there will be a reduction in demand for residential places for young offenders. The views of the special residential services board on the report were received by my Department and are currently being considered.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s commitment to fund the national parents&rsquo; councils began with a proposal in the programme for economic and social progress to pay an annual grant of &euro;31,743 to each council. My Department has provided an allocation of &euro;165,000 for the National Parents Council &mdash; post primary &mdash; and &euro;230,000 for the National Parents Council &mdash; primary &mdash; for 2004.</P>
    <P>In 2003, I commissioned a review of State financial support for and recognition of parental organisations at post-primary level. My Department provided a copy of the review to all of the interested parental groups in late October 2003. Each organisation was invited to consider the report and to forward written observations or alternatively to meet officials of my Department to discuss their response to the report. My Department has received written submissions from the National Congress of Catholic Secondary School Parent Associations, CPSA, the Parents&rsquo; Associations of Community and Comprehensive Schools, PACCS, and the Federation of Christian Brothers Schools Parents Council, FCBSPC. In addition, meetings have taken place between officials of my Department and representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council &mdash; post primary &mdash; CPSA, PACCS and FCBSPC. The most recent of these, with the FCBSPC, was held on the 28 January 2004. To <Col N="942"/>date, none of the other parental organisations have chosen to take up my Department&rsquo;s invitation to forward a submission or meet with officials.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the issues addressed in the review, such as recognition and grant aid, I must take account of the matter of value for money and the need to avoid unnecessary duplication. The review in question emphasised the fact that many of the issues of concern to parents with children at second level are common across the different sectors. It is important, therefore, that any State funding should promote cohesion to the greatest degree possible as this will best serve to increase the voice of parents in education. In considering what action to take on foot of the review, my officials and I will take stock of the submissions received and views expressed at the meetings referred to.</P>

     <Quest>the rationale behind the decision to introduce, for new entrants to the teaching profession a standard retirement age of 65, and the elimination of the various early retirement programmes (details supplied); if he has given any consideration to the growing problem of teacher stress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5107/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decision that the age of retirement of the generality of new entrants to the public service be set at 65 was based on the recommendations of the commission on public service pensions. The commission was established by the Government in 1996 as a result of concerns about the rising cost of public service pensions. The age at which public servants, including teachers, should retire was among the matters which were considered by the commission. In considering this issue, the commission noted that most categories of public servants, including teachers, may serve until the age of 65. The commission also noted that, for operational reasons, certain categories of public servants &mdash; garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces, prison officers and fire-fighters &mdash; are required to retire before reaching the age of 65.</P>
    <P>The commission considered all aspects of the matter, including the fact that life expectancy is rising. It recommended that the retirement age for new entrants to the public service, other than those who are required to retire earlier for operational reasons, be set at 65. The Government has decided to apply this recommendation in the case of public servants recruited on and after 1 April 2004. It will not come into operation generally until after 2040, when public servants recruited since 1 April 2004 begin to reach the age of 65.</P>
    <P>Teachers already in service may continue to avail of the existing early retirement provisions, including the scheme of early retirement <Col N="943"/>introduced under the PCW agreement. The latter scheme was introduced some years ago on a pilot basis pending review following the report of the commission on public service pensions. The commission&rsquo;s 2001 report recommended that the pilot scheme be continued for a further five years and be reviewed after that time. The commission also recommended the introduction of cost neutral early retirement. The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, indicated that he will examine the possibility of providing new entrants with some form of optional early retirement with payment of actuarially reduced benefits which would have a cost neutral effect, as recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>While some employees may experience stress in their jobs and may experience difficulty in coping with stress, I am not satisfied that the occupation of teacher is, in general, any more or less stressful than many other public service jobs which, similarly, do not require retirement before the age of 65. Although a quota of 400 retirements per year was agreed under the early retirement scheme for teachers, the number of retirements in any year since the scheme was introduced in 1996-97 has never reached half of the quota.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, which was fully commenced on 5 July 2002, established the National Educational Welfare Board to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate and educational services and a further eight head office staff. Some 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed to date, including 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service. The board has recently advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies which will bring the total staff complement to 84, including 68 service delivery staff.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials from my Department to work with the board to ensure that opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. The implementation of protocols for <Col N="944"/>such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home school community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers is very important. The protocols will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and will ensure that available existing resources are utilised to the full. It is essential that the board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with the personnel it has the moment and with the help of other people involved in the area. When this has been achieved I will reconsider the position, taking into account the available resources.</P>
    <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and the most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving an education.</P>

	<P>At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law. I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004. It was agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. I understand from the liquidator that he has further extended the period of notice of redundancy for the staff to 27 February 2004. Officials from my Department met with all members of staff of ITE in December 2003. At the request of SIPTU, a further meeting was held on 28 January 2004 with that union and its staff representatives.</P>
    <P>My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving <Col N="945"/>effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute. It is working closely with the liquidator in this regard by exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.

	<P>In announcing the Government&rsquo;s decision on pension age and on the intended abolition of compulsory retirement age for most new entrant public servants from 1 April 2004, the Minister for Finance stated that the public service unions would be fully informed about the implementation of the reforms in advance of their introduction with effect from 1 April 2004. I confirm that the process of informing the public service unions has commenced and that a number of meetings have already taken place between the unions, including the INTO, and officials of the Department of Finance, my Department and other Departments. As the Government has taken its decision about the retirement age of new entrants, and as a forum has been put in place, I <Col N="947"/>do not see that any useful purpose would be served at this time by a meeting such as that suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>While pension benefits are a consideration in career choices, I do not consider that the changes made are likely to give rise to any particular difficulty in the recruitment of teachers. All public service jobs will have the same retirement age for new entrants, with the exception of those groups &mdash; garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces, prison officers and fire-fighters &mdash; which have earlier retirement for operational reasons. I emphasise that the raising of the age of retirement will not affect serving public servants. It will not come into operation generally until public servants recruited since 1 April 2004 begin to reach the age of 65.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a review of the school transport scheme and taking into consideration the recommendations of the joint committee&rsquo;s report on school transport, a number of improvements to the scheme were put in place in 2001. The qualifying distance for eligibility for school transport for primary school pupils aged ten and over was reduced from three to two miles, so that all such pupils are treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new bus service was reduced from ten to seven. The threshold for maintaining a service was reduced to four eligible pupils, provided that at least six fare-paying pupils are using the service. The scope of the remote area grants, payable to pupils in certain circumstances, was extended and the rate payable increased. The travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils was reduced from three to two and a half hours. Where feasible, students who are on the early pick-up from their homes are the first to be dropped home in the evening and <i>vice versa</i>. An independent appeals board was established in 2003 to increase transparency in the system, to demonstrate that appeals are treated in an equitable and objective manner and to facilitate those who wish to appeal decisions about transport services.</P>
    <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has replaced over 200 older school buses since January 2002, thereby improving the quality of buses in service. All school transport vehicles have been provided with a communication system to enable the driver to have ready access to the depot. Other issues raised by the joint committee, including those in respect of safety, are continually under review in <Col N="948"/>my Department. Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, places special emphasis on safety. To this end and to ensure a safe and reliable service, it has put in place a wide range of checking procedures which are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are met. Bus &Eacute;ireann complies fully with all the relevant regulations laid down by the Department of Transport. Given that the cost of providing the school transport service has more than doubled since 1997, my Department is in the process of finalising a review designed to identify efficiencies and savings which can contribute to a containment of the cost of this service.</P>

     <Quest>the aspect of Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s recent findings he agrees with in terms of his Department&rsquo;s dealings with the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the steps he plans to take to ensure that the commission&rsquo;s work can continue to operate efficiently and quickly under Mr. Justice Ryan.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5228/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Third Interim Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is very detailed. I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and the commission for its completion. It refers to the manner in which my Department dealt with the commission, as a sponsor and a respondent. I will comment on those issues and outline the steps that are being taken to ensure that the commission can continue to operate efficiently.</P>
    <P>The resourcing delays to which the commission refers in its report primarily relate to the period from June 2002 onwards, when the commission sought a doubling of its resources. It was necessary that this request be considered by the Government, following which it was decided that a review of the operation of the investigation committee was necessary. I consider that this review has been justified and I am confident that the legislation that will emanate from the review will assist the commission in completing its remit in a timely fashion. Judge Ryan, in his report on the working of the commission that was undertaken prior to his becoming chairperson of the commission, recommended that an <i>ad hoc</i> group of senior officials be identified who could deal with resourcing issues quickly. The Government has accepted this suggestion. I am confident that this process will ensure that all future requests for resources are dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>Regarding my Department&rsquo;s role as respondent, I have already accepted that some difficulties were encountered, especially in complying with a small number of the discovery directions. However, the commission&rsquo;s third interim report acknowledges that &ldquo;some of the difficulties were caused, or contributed to by the <Col N="949"/>Committee in that for example there was not sufficient clarity in the direction as to what was sought, or insufficient time was being allowed for compliance&rdquo;. In an effort to resolve the difficulties that had arisen, the Department reorganised the manner in which it dealt with the commission in early 2003. The residential institutions redress unit of the Department has acted as a focal point for dealing with all commission-related matters since then. This approach ensures that a single unit is aware of all issues relating to the commission. Consequently, the Department is in a position to respond more effectively to discovery directions and any other matters.</P>
    <P>I also appointed the former chairperson of the Bar Council of England and Wales, Mr. Matthias Kelly QC, to conduct a review of the processes and procedures for making discovery to the commission by my Department. The process of meeting and interviewing persons relevant to the review has concluded and Mr. Kelly has returned to the UK to conclude his work on his report. Mr. Kelly has recently provided me with an interim report of his review. He has stated that he originally expected that his report could be completed within a matter of weeks but, given the sheer volume of documentation, it is not possible and he will report in full as soon as possible. I add, however, that in his interim report Mr. Kelly has reached the provisional conclusion that &ldquo;the difficulties over discovery were not due to obstruction or concealment but rather due to poor historic record storage systems and misunderstandings as to what was required&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his report, Judge Ryan stated that he would commence a consultation process with parties to the commission&rsquo;s work. Should this consultation process result in further recommendations from Judge Ryan or steps that could be taken to assist the commission, these will be considered.</P>

In view of the pressures for school accommodation in the Lucan area, my Department used a design and build contract as an innovative method to fast-track the delivery of this project from a greenfield site to a new school building. The tendering process for the project took place in the third quarter of 2003. The successful contractor, who designed the school building, recently received planning permission for it.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 98 together.</P>
    <P>The student charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services, which continue to be incurred by the third level institutions. On 13 November 2003 I announced, as part of my Department&rsquo;s 2004 Estimates, that the student charge will increase from &euro;670 to a proposed level of &euro;750. It has to be remembered that students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the local authorities or the vocational education committees, in addition to any grant to which they are entitled. No student, where the family income is at or less than &euro;40,000 will pay this charge. The student charge is paid by the students on an academic year basis. The level of the charge for each year since its introduction in 1997 was 1997-98, &euro;317; 1998-99, &euro;330; 1999-2000 &euro;353; 2000-01, &euro;371; 2001-02, &euro;396; 2002-03, &euro;670; 2003-04, &euro;670; and the proposed level in 2004-05 is &euro;750. I have no plans to reintroduce third level tuition fees for the 2004-05 academic year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the social personal and health education curriculum strand &ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo; from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the social, personal and health education curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on &ldquo;Belonging and Integrating&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993, my Department issued guidelines on countering bullying behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school-based measures to prevent and deal with instances of <Col N="953"/>bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
    <P>Where staff within my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance is offered by staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The National Educational Psychological Service is also available as a support service to schools for individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

	<P>Unqualified teachers should only be employed in primary schools in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas, to provide for those with special educational needs and the reduction in teacher training places in the mid 1990s. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career break and job sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department has introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers and is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests. The measures introduced include doubling the number of students admitted annually to the B. Ed. programme in the colleges of education; providing post-graduate courses each year; recognising B. Ed. graduates of St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications, as fully qualified; recognising Montessori trained teachers, who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year course in the AMI College, as being fully qualified substitute teachers and to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools; recognising fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of school and classes without the necessity to hold the Irish language qualification and my recent decision to recognise graduates of a new primary teacher training course, accredited by HETAC and being delivered by Hibernia College, for the purposes of primary teaching.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years and in this context my Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion referred to by the Deputy is contained within the discussion report, The Points System: A Review Needed ?, recently produced by the skills initiative unit. This report sought to promote discussion of the points system in order to seek if possible a more effective and equitable admissions process.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the skills initiative unit is interesting, however increasing access through the allocation of additional points to disadvantaged school leavers needs to be balanced with a careful consideration of how best to support the subsequent participation in and completion of third level courses by students who have experienced prior socio-economic and educational disadvantage. Some thinking and development of a national strategy for this area has already occurred through the work of the action group on access and is being progressed through the work of the educational disadvantage committee and the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration was given to the most effective means of increasing access and supporting participation of disadvantaged school leavers by the action group on access in 2001 who recommended a threefold strategy, based on prior leaving certificate attainment. It was recommended that disadvantaged school leavers who achieve over three hundred points in their leaving certificate should be facilitated in entering third level institutions through a system of reserved places with direct entry. It was also recommended that students who achieve only minimum matriculation requirements for entry to higher education are at high risk if they enter third level without further preparation and would need to be supported through a system of pre-entry preparatory programmes as well as reserved places with direct entry. It was recommended that those students who have not attained minimum matriculation requirements for entry would benefit most from the undertaking of bridging courses in the further education sector.</P>
    <P>Alternative entry mechanisms to college for disadvantaged school leavers being implemented by third level institutions operate mainly through students entering directly on the basis of having being assessed under a system of alternative admissions criteria. These criteria would include a student having attended a designated disadvantaged school for the entire duration of their second level studies, having achieved a certain points threshold in their leaving certificate and in general being highly motivated and interested in studying at third level. Other socio-<Col N="956"/>economic criteria taken into consideration would include a family background of long-term unemployment, low income, little or no progression to higher education. Other strategies being pursued in institutions include disadvantaged school leavers being offered a place following the successful undertaking of either an access or foundation course or a post-leaving certificate course under the higher education links scheme.</P>
    <P>Currently six of the HEA funded institutions, University College, Dublin, NUI Maynooth, University College, Cork, Dublin City University, University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology are collaborating in the operation of a higher education direct applications scheme as a means of allocating direct entry places to socio-economically disadvantaged school leavers. The scheme is open to pupils attending all designated disadvantaged schools linked to the access schemes of the institutions involved and essentially operates as a &rsquo;mini-CAO&rsquo; type applications system, whereby the seven institutions pool their reserved places, adopt a common application form and co-ordinate the making of offers so as to avoid duplication between institutions. This scheme has facilitated increasing numbers of disadvantaged school leavers in attending participant institutions with over 1,400 offers of third level places having being made since 2000.</P>
    <P>The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education has recently been established within the Higher Education Authority. The work of the this office will include the devising of a national strategy on equity of access to higher education, including consideration as to the most effective means of increasing participation from amongst disadvantaged school leavers.</P>
    <P>The suggestion referred to by Deputy Penrose is, therefore, under consideration within my Department in the context of the work of the educational disadvantage committee and the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education.</P>

	<P>Section 14 of the Education Act 1998 places upon the patron of a recognised school the duty to appoint a board of management.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The indemnity agreement provided that the property contribution of the congregations was to be divided into two separate and distinct parts. One part comprised of property to be transferred from June 2002 onwards, property to be transferred and the other part comprised of transferred between May 1999 and the signing of the indemnity agreement in June 2002, property already transferred.</P>
    <P>In respect of the properties to be transferred my Department has accepted, in principle, 34 of the properties offered. These properties have been valued by the congregations at &euro;22.6 million. Eight properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title while three properties are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>The congregations submitted a list of additional properties for the State to consider in June 2003. Some six properties from this list have been accepted in principle and the remaining six are under consideration by my Department. One of the congregations was not in a position to offer an alternative property and an equivalent cash sum was received instead. The amount being paid in cash by this congregation is &euro;4 million, &euro;2 million of which has already been received while the further &euro;2 million will be paid by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Another property listed on this schedule was the subject of a compulsory purchase order. This matter was resolved last month and realised a sum of &euro;987,500. The receipt of these cash payments reduces the total value of the property to be transferred from &euro;36.54 million to &euro;31.55 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to property already transferred, officials from my Department have sought additional information from the congregations to ensure that each of these properties qualify under the criteria laid down in the indemnity agreement <Col N="958"/>regarding valuation, title and restriction on transfer for a 25 year period. To date one of the properties on this list has been accepted in principle.</P>
    <P>As negotiations are ongoing and because the issue is commercially sensitive, I do not intend to give details regarding the identity of the properties at this stage. However, when agreement has been concluded on the property aspect of the agreement a list of the properties concerned will be made available.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As provided for in Sustaining Progress the Secretary General of my Department and the education sector performance verification group accepted a progress report provided by the teachers conciliation council confirming progress on the agreed commitments. This was provided in the context of the payments applicable from 1 January 2004 and was predicated on the expectation that real progress would be made in the discussions on parent-teacher meetings which, under the agreement, were scheduled to be concluded before the end of December 2003. Due to the fact that no agreement had been reached and that the issue was being referred to the arbitration board it was the view of the Secretary General that it was only reasonable to await executing arrangements for the payments due 1 January 2004 until the arbitration process had concluded. Agreement has now been reached on the arrangements for the holding of parent-teacher meetings following the arbitration process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that difficulties arose with issues of non-compliance by certain schools regarding the agreed arrangements for the standardised school year. In order to report comprehensively on the position and to bring the matter to the teachers conciliation council for its consideration my Department requested that each school complete a declaration regarding compliance with the agreements reached in respect of the standardised school year, parent-teacher meeting and staff meetings for the school year 2003-2004.</P>
    <P>The outcome of that process was considered by the teachers conciliation council in the context of their finalising proposals for the arrangements for the standardised school year for the coming school years. Agreement has now been reached at the council on the arrangements for the next four school years which will enable my Department to execute the arrangements for payment of the appropriate increases to teachers <Col N="959"/>without delay. The payments will be backdated to 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Payment of the 3% general round increase due 1 January 2004 under Sustaining Progress is being withheld in respect of technicians in Athlone Institute of Technology pending a satisfactory resolution of a local issue relating to the grade. Discussions on this issue are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Discussions on a modernisation agenda are continuing under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission for the grades of special needs assistants and school secretaries. Payment of the appropriate increases cannot be made until agreement has been reached and verifiable progress on the modernisation agenda has been recorded.</P>

    <P>I am aware that schools have experienced difficulties having prospective employees vetted. A cross-governmental working group has been established to consider proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit run by the <Col N="960"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Its terms of reference include defining the type of organisation which should come within the ambit of the vetting process. The group is chaired by a Garda chief superintendent and includes officials from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science, with the Office of the Attorney General. It has met on eight occasions and I understand that it hopes to finalise its report within the next two weeks. Without wishing to prejudice the work of that group, it is clear that the issues involved relate to a number of Departments and continuing co-operation between them will be required in bringing forward reforms.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act provided for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the board was formally established on 16 December 2002. To date the board has received a total of 2,849 applications and has completed the process of consideration in 680 cases.</P>
    <P>There is a number of provisions in the Act which provide protection against false claims. The Act provides that the board must notify any person named as an alleged abuser of any application and allow them to make a response to the allegation. The principles of natural justice allows for a person to be in a position to respond to any allegation made against them and should such a person be of the view that the allegations are false there is little doubt but that they would inform the board of this.</P>
    <P>Section 7(6) of the Act provides that a person who gives false evidence to the Residential Institutions Redress Board or the review committee shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to the penalties applying to perjury. I would add that the making of an award to an applicant does not constitute a finding of fact relating to the fault or negligence on the part of any person. Awards are made based on medical evidence. While there is always a danger in any redress scheme that false applications would be made the process by which the board determines awards based on medical evidence will lessen that danger.</P>

	<P>F&Aacute;S apprentices are not charged any tuition fees in respect of their apprenticeship training in the institutes of technology. In 2003, I received requests from several governing bodies of institutes of technology for approval to apply the student service charge to defray the costs of registration, examinations and student services, to students enrolled on F&Aacute;S apprenticeship courses. The institutes argued that a <i>pro rata </i>charge should be levied on apprentices on the basis that they avail of the full range of services provided to students in the institutes. The institutes considered it inequitable to levy the charge on full-time students only as thereby full-time students were effectively subsidising apprentices through their contributions toward the cost of providing student services.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the case made by the institutes of technology decided to approve the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>student services charge for F&Aacute;S apprentices from January 2004. I understand that the institutes have now informed all apprentices of the introduction of the student service charge and that collection of the charge is currently in train.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years many improvements have been made to assist principal teachers in the performance of their duties and to relieve their administrative burden.</P>
    <P>Until the 1999-2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become an administrative principal where the school had eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the 2000-01 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers and in schools with a principal plus 11 or more teachers including ex-quota posts. Further improvements were granted in the 2001-02 school year when schools were allowed to appoint an administrative principal where there were six mainstream class teachers. The provisions were further enhanced for the 2002-03 school year whereby administrative principals can be appointed to schools with a large number of ex-quota posts where there is a principal plus nine or more teachers in the school.</P>
    <P>The scheme of release time was introduced for the 2000-01 school year. This enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative <Col N="965"/>leadership and management functions. The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. My Department provides paid substitution for the days that principals are on release time. Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools by the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to posts of responsibility holders. The number of these posts ranges from two in a two teacher school to, for example, 20 in a 40 teacher school.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from &euro;50.79 per pupil in the 200-01 school year, to &euro;127 per pupil in the current year school year. My Department is developing a computerised on-line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers. The implementation of this project should help to further reduce the administrative burden on principal teachers.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Justice H. Abbott handed down his judgment in the application by the Christian Brothers to the High Court on 17 October 2003. The High Court found that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 is not unconstitutional and that the investigation committee of the commission could operate in the manner outlined in the Act. Work on legislation amending the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act is well advanced and the office of the parliamentary counsel is working on including legislative amendments, recommended in Judge Sean Ryan&rsquo;s report, in the draft Bill.</P>
    <P>However, there are two issues in particular that need to be taken account of prior to the legislation being published: the ongoing litigation involving the Christian Brothers must be concluded before legislation can be finalised. Judge Ryan in his report states that notice must <Col N="966"/>be taken of the Christian Brothers case and the potential effect of the ultimate judgment in the case on the proceedings of the investigation committee. Judge Ryan states &ldquo;It is impractical to suggest that there could be amending legislation processed and enacted until the Murray-Gibson (Christian Brothers) litigation is determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The final version of Judge Abbott&rsquo;s judgment in this matter was issued on 27 January 2004 and the 21 day period during which parties to that case can decide whether or not to appeal to the Supreme Court has now expired. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office has informed my Department that while the written notification has not yet been received, the solicitors for the Christian Brothers have informed the CSSO that they are going to appeal. My Department will follow this issue up with the CSSO with a view to ensuring, in so far as possible, that the Supreme Court would hear such an appeal as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is possible that Judge Ryan will recommend further legislative changes arising from the consultation he intends to undertake with all parties to the Commission and any recommendations for legislative change would have to be considered in the finalisation of the draft Bill. Meanwhile, he has outlined several matters in chapter 8 of his report that it is possible for the investigation committee of the commission to progress in advance of amending legislation. These matters include, <i>inter alia</i>, writing to all complainants to the investigation committee and examining material already provided to the committee in preparation for future hearings.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Drug use and the dangers of drug addiction are addressed in the substance use module of the junior cycle social, personal and health education curriculum which was introduced in September 2000. One of aims of the SPHE curriculum is to enable students to develop an informed and sensible attitude to substances, including drugs, so that they can make responsible and healthy decisions in relation to their personal lives and social development. The educational resource material On My Own Two Feet has been recommended as core resource material for the SPHE curriculum and many aspects of substance-drug use, including the consequences of drug taking, are addressed by this resource. Since September 2000, the implementation of SPHE in post primary schools has been supported by the post primary SPHE support service, in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. Support has been offered to all <Col N="967"/>schools and training in the delivery of SPHE at junior cycle has been provided to more than 4,300 teachers to date.</P>
    <P>All post primary schools are required to have SPHE timetabled as part of their school curriculum, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s circular M11-03, with effect from September 2003. Under action 43 of the National Drugs Strategy, the Department of Education and Science developed guidelines for developing a school substance use policy in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. These guidelines were issued to all schools in May 2002 to assist them in the development of substance use policies. The individual school&rsquo;s substance use policy is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and dealing with relevant issues in a planned and considered way.</P>

	<P>Youthreach is an interdepartmental initiative between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for young people who left school early without qualifications or with poor qualifications.

	<P>In the 2002-03 academic year my Department assisted schools in respect of Internet access on the basis of subventing the telephone line rental, Internet service provider subscription cost and up to two hours dial-up usage per day. In all these supports cost some &euro;2.2 million.</P>
    <P>In the 2003-04 year my Department adjusted its support provision for schools&rsquo; Internet access having regard to the advent in mid-2003 of significantly cheaper flat rate Internet services in the market and in view of departmental budget constraints. An Internet support grant of &euro;200 for a PSTN line and &euro;300 for an ISDN line is being made available in the 2003-04 academic year, the total cost of which will be in the region of &euro;1 million. While, in absolute terms, this represents a reduction in funding of over 50%, a more competitive market means that Internet usage charges to schools can be at least 30% lower than in the previous year as a result of the recently introduced flat rate service. The funding support provided by my Department is an interim provision pending the introduction of a broadband Internet service for all first and second level schools. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard in the near future.</P>

	<P>Physical education is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools. In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</P>
    <P>In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of &euro;1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of &euro;635. Approximately &euro;2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme. In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I <Col N="969"/>decided to withdraw payment of the grant from 2003. However, schools may use their ordinary capitation grant which has been increased to &euro;121.58 with effect from 1 January 2004. The position will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary or wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; P60 and other sources are used. Work permits are not granted for sectors such as domestic employment where it is believed that such employment can be met from the Irish-EEA labour market.</P>
    <P>The protections available to foreign nationals employed here through the work permit system are not, in any way whatsoever, different to those available and applied in the case of an Irish employee. The avenues for seeking redress are set out in each relevant Act and, specifically, in <Col N="970"/>accordance with the nature of the instance of non-compliance or abuse being alleged.</P>
    <P>For example, where there is a claim that an employer has failed to comply with regulations governing holidays entitlements, as set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act, an employee would be advised to bring such a matter to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission. This is the procedure and recourse that is provided for under the legislation and the facility is equally available to both Irish nationals and foreign nationals alike.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies across the full spectrum of employment legislation, including the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, that are generated under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946-2001. It should be noted also, that where issues arise that fall within the remit of equality legislation, the provisions of those enactments will apply. This legislation is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality since statutory employment rights and protections, as already stated, apply to emigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that the employment rights information unit in my Department provides a comprehensive range of explanatory leaflets and guides on different entitlements under employment rights legislation. An updated Guide to Labour Law was published last November. A revision and updating exercise was also completed on a series of information leaflets, in nine languages, about employment rights legislation in Ireland. The leaflets are available on request to the information unit or <i>via </i>the Department&rsquo;s website. Arrangements are also being made to have the information leaflets made available at a variety of locations such as citizen information centres, embassies and from the regional offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, where non-national citizens go to register within 90 days of arrival in the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I have stated before, if there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting emigrant workers I would ask that this evidence be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>

	<P>A flood relief scheme for the River Suir, Clonmel, has been brought to outline design <Col N="977"/>stage and was placed on public exhibition, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts, in December 2001 and January 2002. The next stage in the progression of the scheme is to consider and respond to the large number of observations received following the public exhibition.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2002 I initiated a major review of the State&rsquo;s approach to flooding with the primary objective of developing a cohesive national flooding policy in the future. That report is currently being considered by Government Departments before being submitted to the Government in the very near future. The recommendations of the review group will have an important influence on the whole flood management area in the future, and I am confident that the recommendations will, in the long-term, substantially mitigate the impact of flooding on Irish society.</P>
    <P>The time scale for progression of the proposed scheme in Clonmel is dependent on resolution of all issues arising from the public exhibition and consideration of issues arising from the policy review. I can assure the Deputy that Clonmel has a high priority in the OPW flood relief programme and that every effort is being made, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, to ensure that the scheme is progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that tax relief for private hospitals and sports injury clinics are not at present captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling estimates of cost to the Exchequer. Claims for these reliefs are aggregated in tax returns with other claims, such as with industrial buildings allowances generally or with other capital allowances, and do not distinguish between the reliefs claimed in respect of the different schemes. Accordingly, the specific information is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>
    <P>I consider it important that data be improved to facilitate assessments of such expenditures and reliefs. The Department of Finance has been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to investigate information and data capture issues arising with a view to producing possible solutions. The challenge is twofold: the first is to identify the optimal manner of obtaining the <Col N="978"/>information that is required to monitor and cost existing reliefs and the second is to obtain such information with due regard to not overburdening compliant taxpayers. Bearing this in mind the Revenue Commissioners will be introducing a number of changes to the forms relating to the annual return of income in respect of the tax year 2004. These changes will yield additional information regarding the cost of various tax reliefs, including those referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>As these schemes were introduced in the past few years, no formal review of these schemes has yet been undertaken. However, these schemes will be kept under examination, especially in the context of the annual budget and Finance Bill process, to ensure they continue to meet the purposes for which they were introduced.</P>

     <Quest>the cost to the Exchequer of the capital allowances for multi-storey car parks; if an analysis has been done as to the supposed benefit or otherwise of these allowances to the economy and society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[5483/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 344 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a scheme of capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of certain multi-storey car parks where the relevant local authority certifies that it is satisfied that the car park has been developed in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Included in the criteria which must be met is a provision that the car park must support the objective of making the core area of the urban centre in which the car park is located the focus for the centre&rsquo;s commercial and business activity. Furthermore, the planning and design of the multi-storey car park must take account of the nature and character of the area in which it is located and the provision of the car park must be supportive of the relevant local authority&rsquo;s traffic and parking management policies.</P>
    <P>This scheme was introduced in 1995 to reinforce the primary importance of the inner core of urban areas. Faced with the increasing trend of retail centres to locate in peripheral areas with better road links and readily available parking areas, the provision of extra off-street car parking in urban centres for shoppers and other short-stay users was aimed at assisting in the regeneration of the inner cores of urban areas and making them more attractive places to visit and do business. At the time of the introduction of the scheme, the Dublin transportation initiative supported the need to encourage people to use the city centre through the provision of adequate short-term parking.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the qualifying criteria laid down for this relief are sufficiently robust and comprehensive to ensure that the provision of qualifying multi-storey car parks is undertaken primarily to respond to increased local demands for additional parking and to support the objective of developing the core urban area. In addition, in common with all special tax incentives schemes, this relief is subject to a process of ongoing review. It was in the context of this ongoing review and in response to <Col N="980"/>recommendations from the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Dublin Transport Office that I decided in the 1999 budget to terminate this relief with effect from 1 July 1999 in respect of projects in the Cork and Dublin metropolitan areas. Additionally, in advance of 2003 budget, I reviewed the position on all reliefs and, as a result of this, I announced a termination date of 31 December 2004 for this scheme and a number of other reliefs including the urban, rural and town renewal scheme, film relief, etc. However, arising from concerns expressed from a range of parties, including local authorities, that the deadline of 31 December 2004 was placing undue pressure on building resources, I felt that there was a strong case for allowing a longer winding down period for these schemes. This will allow for a more orderly completion of projects where delays had arisen for various reasons. To this end, I have made provisions in Finance Bill 2004 to extend the 31 December 2004 deadline for this relief to 31 July 2006.</P>
    <P>Regarding exact details of the cost of the scheme, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that tax relief for multi-storey car parks are not at present captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling estimates of the total annual cost to the Exchequer. Claims for these reliefs are aggregated in tax returns with other claims, such as with industrial buildings allowances generally or with other capital allowances, and do not distinguish between the reliefs claimed in respect of the different schemes. Accordingly, the specific information is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>

However, it is not expected that these increases will have a significant long term impact on the Department&rsquo;s telecommunications expenditure, as officials had already been examining the greater use of alternative and more economic means for connecting to the public switch network in the context of the Government virtual private network.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 155 together.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have funding available to support the operation of environmental education city farms. However, it facilitates the operation of Airfield Trust through the secondment of two teachers on a cost recoupment basis, and through hire and use of the venue for delivery of inservice training to teachers on environmental education, for part delivery of aspects of post-leaving certificate courses in collaboration with local colleges of further education, and a farm studies module as part of the transition year programme.</P>
    <P>Airfield Trust is also a popular venue for school educational visits, and the cost of these are partly funded by student contributions and a small grant from Blackrock education centre.</P>
    <P>There may be some scope for funding of part time adult education programmes at further education level for specific targeted groups under the back to education initiative community strand. The deadline for applications for 2004 courses under this Initiative is 20 February 2004. A copy of the guidelines and application form are on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> under further education.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 151 together.</P>
    <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since the measure was introduced the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to more than 2,500. The number of special needs assistants has also grown from approximately 300 to 4,319 full-time and 1,353 part-time posts.</P>
    <P>There are over 6,000 applications for special educational resources awaiting a decision from my Department. More than 5,000 were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 and they are being considered. Priority was given to <Col N="990"/>cases involving children that commenced school last September. These cases were responded to and we continue to respond to emergency applications.</P>
    <P>Processing applications is complex and time consuming. My Department is endeavouring to process them as quickly as possible and will then respond to all applicant schools. A dedicated team, comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service, reviewed the balance of more than 4,000 applications. They are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special needs provision conducted over the past year. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of special needs provision.</P>
    <P>An additional 2,200 applications have been received since 1 September 2003. The arrangements for processing applications received since then will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. My officials have initiated discussions with representative interests. It would be premature to anticipate the outcome at this stage. The review will ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Pending the conclusion of discussions with the representative interests, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03 issued last September. It contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs.</P>
    <P>My Department also allocates resource teaching posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools. A total of 465 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants and approximately 968 whole-time equivalent teaching posts are currently in place in the second level system. They support students with special needs. Additional resources are allocated on an ongoing basis in response to professionally assessed needs. Applications for resource teaching and special needs assistant support for the 2004-05 school year will continue to be considered on this basis.</P>

    <P>My Department will consider applications for special educational needs and supports in the context of the criteria outlined in the relevant Department circulars and the existing level of SEN resources available in a school. My Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting children with such needs in the primary school system is reflected in the significant growth in investment in recent years. This is illustrated by the following details: the number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in 1998 to 1,531 at present with an annual salary cost of approximately &euro;54 million; the number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,500 at present with an annual salary cost estimated at over &euro;75 million; the number of special needs assistants in the primary system has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,319 full-time and a further 1,353 part-time posts with an annual salary cost estimated at &euro;120 million for 2004; the allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special educational needs has been increased from &euro;12 million in 2002 to &euro;31.7 million in 2004; funding for special equipment in the primary school system has increased from &euro;635,000 in 1998 to &euro;3 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>The resources that have been and that will continue to be allocated by my Department represent real and substantial improvements in special education services. They provide concrete evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build on the unprecedented development of such services.</P>

The projected ratio at primary level for the current school year is 17.35:1 and at post-primary level the projected ratio is 13.48:1.

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland remains opposed to the use of nuclear energy on grounds that the environmental, health and safety risks and impact outweigh the benefits. Under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 nuclear power cannot be used for the production of electricity in Ireland.</P><Col N="993"/>
    <P>It is not possible to guarantee that electricity imported over the proposed east-west interconnector will not be generated from nuclear sources. It is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network. This is the case with the existing interconnection between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland through the Moyle interconnector.</P>
    <P>The EU Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC concerns common rules for the internal market in electricity and repeals Directive 96/92/EC. It avoids an imbalance in the opening of electricity markets, the supply of electricity to customers deemed eligible in other member states shall not be prohibited. The directive is scheduled to be transposed into Irish law by 1 July 2004. However, the earliest date for commencement of construction work on an east-west interconnector is the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the electricity directive means that all electricity suppliers must meet certain requirements. They must specify in or with electricity bills and promotional material, made available to final customers, the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year. Suppliers will also be obliged to specify existing reference sources, such as web pages, where information on the environmental impact, in terms of at least emissions of CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> and the radioactive waste resulting from the electricity produced by the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year, is publicly available.</P>
    <P LI="1">I am confident, given the known popular opposition to nuclear energy in Ireland, that suppliers would not knowingly contract for electricity imports clearly traceable to nuclear stations or that Irish consumers would knowingly buy any. There is simply no business case for selling nuclear energy in Ireland.</P>

	<P el="0">As I explained in my reply to Parliamentary Question <Col N="994"/>No. 116 on 29 January, site investigations to assess the volume and quality of mineral deposits are carried out by mining companies at their own expense. Reports on the mineral deposits in the area were supplied by the existing mine lessee&rsquo;s experts. The reports were assessed by the technical staff of my Department&rsquo;s exploration and mining division. They are satisfied that sizeable deposits of minerals exist. Consultants appointed on behalf of Kilkenny County Council concur with their view. Material supplied by the geological survey was also examined in the course of my Department&rsquo;s examination. However, GSI has no current information on the volume of mineral deposits in the area.</P>
    <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 356 of 3 February I said that officials from my Department had met representatives of the local community on 29 January 2004. The community&rsquo;s views, including a suggestion to revisit a detailed geological report dated 1971 produced by a mining company&rsquo;s consultant, are being examined. A full response will be issued in due course.</P>

	<P>Under the British Irish Agreement Act 1999, responsibility for the development and licensing of aquaculture in Lough Foyle was conferred on the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.</P>
    <P>My Department is working in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and respective legal advisers. We want to design the necessary legislation to enable the loughs agency of the FCILC to, <i>inter alia</i>, exercise its aquaculture functions as soon as practicable. The legislation is complex and needs to provide for the licensing and control of aquaculture, including a full appeals process and fish health matters. It must also address jurisdictional issues, including access to courts North and South in respect of offences committed in a cross-Border context. The aim is to ensure that aquaculture in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough is developed and managed in a sustainable way.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing its efforts to finalise the drafting of its part of the Foyle Carlingford Fisheries Bill and to facilitate publication by the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>Under the British Irish Agreement Act 1999, one of the functions set out for the loughs agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission is the development of marine tourism. The Act also provides that this function will include the preparation of a strategic plan for marine tourism in the Foyle and Carlingford areas. It also provides for the promotion and marketing of those areas, including grant aid and co-ordination of the delivery of the development strategy.</P>
    <P>Last October my ministerial counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Ian Pearson MP, and I gave our approval for the agency to engage a consultancy to carry out a study to examine the development potential of marine related tourism and recreational activities in both Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle and the role of the loughs agency in promoting that development. I am advised by the agency that it now proposes to carry out the study in co-operation with the north west cross-Border group, on which Donegal County Council has representation, and the east Border region group.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the agency that the study will draw on all relevant reports that have been published to date on marine tourism in Lough Foyle, including those produced by the county council. There will also be wide consultation with interested parties in the Donegal area. I urge all stakeholders, and particularly State agencies, North and South, involved in the development of the Foyle and Carlingford areas, to work closely together to ensure that their full potential for marine tourism is realised.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the agency that it was invited to contribute to the independent expert report on the development of marinas and sea angling centres commissioned by the DCC during its preparation. There is ongoing interaction between the council and the agency through various fora and I am advised that they work closely at many levels.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent reclassification of cannabis in the United Kingdom means that the maximum criminal penalties for possession of cannabis would be reduced and that the possession of cannabis would become a non-arrestable offence. Possession would remain a criminal offence punishable by the criminal courts. It is suggested that the police would then have the option to report for summons.</P>
    <P>In Ireland drugs are not classified for penalty purposes in the same way as the UK. While the various controlled drugs have been placed in various Schedules, a classification in Ireland is exclusively for the purpose for the controls that are applicable to the classes concerned and have no consequences for the penalties that the courts may apply.</P>
    <P>Possession of any controlled drug, without due authorisation, is an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The legislation makes a distinction between possession for personal use and possession for sale or supply. Penalties for possession depend on the type of substance, such <Col N="1000"/>as cannabis or other drugs, and on penal proceedings such as whether a summary conviction or a conviction on indictment is obtained. Penalties for unlawful possession for the purpose of sale or supply range from imprisonment for up to one year and-or a fine on summary conviction or up to imprisonment for life and-or an unlimited fine if convicted on indictment.</P>
    <P>Possession of cannabis and cannabis resin is considered in a different way to other drugs. Possession of cannabis or cannabis resin for personal use is punishable only by a fine on the first and second offences. In the case of a third and subsequent offence, possession for personal use would incur a fine and-or a term of imprisonment at the discretion of the courts. This would be for up to one year on summary conviction and if convicted on indictment imprisonment for up to three years and-or a fine. Possession in any other case would incur a penalty of imprisonment for up to one year and-or a fine on summary conviction and/or up to seven years imprisonment if convicted on indictment. Following the reclassification of cannabis in the UK the equivalent penalties continue to be much higher than here.</P>
    <P>The recent events in the UK do not create a justification for a change in our laws or in our approach to the possession, for personal use, of cannabis or cannabis resin here.</P>

	<P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1996 regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector. The aim is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children <Col N="1002"/>and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Details of deficiencies in services identified during inspection are outlined in writing to the provider and the provider is required to outline measures that will be put in place to deal with the deficiencies. While taking cognisance of their statutory duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children the health board pre-school inspection teams work in a supportive way with the providers to ensure that planned improvements are made.</P>
    <P>Where serious breaches of the regulations concerning the health, safety and welfare of children identified during an inspection are not rectified within a specified timescale, health boards can bring the matter to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991. The court may impose a fine or prohibit a provider from operating a pre-school service for a specified period.</P>
    <P>The health boards have provided information that there are currently no services closing as a result of court proceedings. Health boards state that the number of services are increasing with the assistance of grant aid and other supports available under the equal opportunities child care programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Health boards as part of their advisory service are working closely with prospective providers. They work with the county and city child care committees to ensure that services coming on stream are in compliance with legislative requirements.</P>
    <P>I understand from the health boards that pre-school services do close voluntarily occasionally for a number of reasons ranging from personal reasons to financial viability to other legislative requirements such as fire or planning. On the introduction of the regulations providers would have cited the requirements of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 as the reason for closure sometimes in advance of having been inspected. At present it is significantly less likely to be a reason for closure.</P>
    <P>Two of the area health boards in the eastern region could not provide information on the issues raised by the Deputy in the time available. My Department has asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to reply directly to the Deputy about the two boards.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Entitlement to health services here is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the CEO of the appropriate health board. Persons aged 70 years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card. In other cases medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the CEO, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P><Col N="1004"/>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the CEO of the health board or authority to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card. Guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. They are not statutorily binding and even though a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the CEO considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the CEO of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide them for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Health board CEOs have discretion to issue medical cards. A range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers&rsquo; allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card. A medical card may still be awarded if a CEO considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that increases in social welfare rates in recent years mean that rates may exceed the income guidelines for a medical card. As a result my Department has written to the chairman of the CEOs&rsquo; group on a number of occasions. The most recent contact was made on 5 November 2003. He was asked to advise the CEOs of my concern that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged by virtue of increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget. They were asked to ensure that increases in social welfare payments do not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards by reference to the income guidelines. They were also asked to make every effort to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</P>

Although many of the children who receive early intervention will not become independent in adulthood, it is hoped that their level of dependency will be significantly reduced. It is also expected that early education may increase the child&rsquo;s likelihood of progressing toward full inclusion during primary school.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the relevant health boards to prioritise the allocation of funding to various projects. Regard must be taken of the identified service needs and the financial resources available to the board in any given year.</P>

     <Quest>if, in view of the medical circumstances of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9, the penalty points assigned to them can be deleted, particularly in view of the fact that this was done on two previous occasions prior to the introduction of penalty points; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The endorsement of penalty points results as a direct consequence of a person being convicted of the commission of an offence that attracts penalty points or where a person decides to pay a fixed charge in respect of such offence.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system has been designed and structured to ensure that any person who is accused of the commission of a penalty point offence is afforded a significant time period to choose whether or not to allow the matter to proceed to court. The option of the payment of a fixed charge is afforded to the accused person in respect of 61 of the 69 penalty point offences identified in the Road Traffic Act 2002.</P>
    <P>I understand from the correspondence presented in association with the question that the person, to whom the Deputy refers, has on this occasion paid the fixed charge, the consequence of which is the resultant endorsement of an appropriate number of points on his licence record. In the circumstances, and as the endorsement of the penalty points was consequential to the making of that payment, there can be no question of the points being deleted from the entry for that person in the licence record.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated many times in recent months, it is not my preferred course of action to change the status of Loughan House. The Government decision on this matter makes it clear that this step will only take place if there is no resolution to the ongoing negotiations taking place with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. In effect, the future role of Loughan House is linked to this process. However, if a change of status for Loughan House becomes necessary, the most appropriate location for each prisoner will be considered on a case by case basis. The facility itself will continue in operation, albeit under a different management in the event of a change of status, and will continue to accept prisoners under sentence on conditional temporary release arrangements which would have the same effect as current residency.</P>

    <P>During 2003 a mid-term evaluation of each of the regional operational programmes was carried out in partnership between the EU Commission, the managing authorities and the implementing bodies as required under the EU Structural Fund regulations.</P>
    <P>An important aim of the mid-term evaluation is to provide a suitable framework for making informed decisions about setting priorities for the second phase of the regional programmes and for making any adjustments, such as changes to the community support framework which might have become necessary. This post-evaluation review, which involves all the parties concerned with funding, managing and implementing the programmes, will look at all aspects of the <Col N="1014"/>programme, but in particular, the effectiveness, progress and continued relevance of the priorities and measures, including the child care measures, making up both programmes.</P>
    <P>While both post-evalution reviews are ongoing at present, it is expected that some new proposals will be brought to the spring monitoring committee of the regions concerned. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment on how this process might impact on the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>

	<P>The precise information sought <Col N="1016"/>in the question is not maintained centrally in my Department, except for broad accounting purposes and accordingly, it may be necessary to check a number of individual files to ensure that the response will be as accurate as possible. For this reason, it is not possible, in the relatively short length of time available to me between the putting down of a question and scheduled day for its reply, to compile all of the information sought in the question. However, I will write to the Deputy in the near future conveying to him as much of the information as is reasonably available from existing files, without having my Department engage in exhaustive research which would not be warranted, and which could be carried out only at the expense of other important work.</P>
    <P>By way of completeness, I should inform the Deputy that in the normal course of the administration of the affairs of any Department, regular consultation with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and with the Office of the Attorney General is a matter of routine. This is particularly true of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because of the quasi-legal aspects of many of its functions. Such legal advice is not charged for and, accordingly, no information as to its costs is available.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when a legal action is taken in the courts, against the Department, or against another Government agency and this Department is conjoined as a defendant, it is normal practice for the Chief State Solicitor to act as this Department&rsquo;s solicitor for the purposes of the proceedings. This is the normal procedure for all Departments. Not only does the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office act as legal agents of this Department for the purposes for the proceedings, they also select the relevant legal representation that is to be made available to the defence and decide the level of legal costs to be incurred. Such costs are not readily available from the records of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so I have referred that aspect of the question to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of L <i>v.</i> O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.

In that context he will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 212, inclusive, and Question No. 214 together.</P>
    <P>At the outset it should be emphasised, as was stated in the public notice of 18 July 2003 on this matter, that every application for leave to remain in the State based on the parentage of an Irish born child will be examined and decided individually.</P>
    <P>In respect of every person, including a parent of Irish born children, who has no legal entitlement to remain in the State, a letter issues under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, informing him or her of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to deport. The person is allowed fifteen days in which to opt for one of the following: make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he or she should not be deported; leave the State before <Col N="1019"/>an order is made; or consent to the making of a deportation order.</P>
    <P>If a person opts to return voluntarily, assistance will be provided. If a person opts to make representations as to why he or she should not be deported a range of factors must be taken into account in deciding the matter. The specific legislative provisions are as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 dealing with <i>refoulement</i>. Further, consideration is given to the specific findings in the Supreme Court L <i>v. </i>O judgement of January 2003 and to subsequent judgements. Included in this consideration are the family and domestic circumstances of the person concerned which would encompass the age and length of residence in the State of the Irish born child.</P>
    <P>The judgement in the L <i>v.</i> O<i>.</i> case is complex but an important finding was that while an Irish child has a right to have the care and company of its parents, there is no absolute right for this to take place in Ireland; further, that the Government may determine to deport a family, notwithstanding the effective removal of the Irish born child, without violating the child&rsquo;s rights. The absence of such automatic rights of residence are a feature of most immigration regimes.</P>
    <P>In relation to exposing Irish citizen children to persecution or discrimination in the countries concerned, it should be noted that the making of a deportation order in respect of the child&rsquo;s parents is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which forbids the sending of a person in any manner whatsoever to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person&rsquo;s race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Notwithstanding this <i>refoulement</i> provision it is, of course, accepted that non-national parents of an Irish born child, and in most circumstances, the child also, will return to countries which may have education, healthcare and other social services at a lesser level than are enjoyed in this country. In this context, it should be noted that the Supreme Court in the L <i>v. </i>O judgement indicated that it cannot be said as a matter of law that the parents of a minor can assert a choice to reside in the State on behalf of a minor, even if that could be said to be in the interests of the minor.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 215 together.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of L v. O the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date.</P>
    <P>However, for any parent of an Irish born child who had an outstanding application and who does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a Ministerial proposal to deport him or her. In that context the person will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order the person will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. The nature of the permission given to such persons exempts them from the employment permit requirement.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a specific provision whereby persons who are not permitted to be in the State nonetheless have permission to work, study or train in the State. An entitlement or a permission to be in the State is a clear prerequisite to engaging in any type of activity while in the State.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no contradiction between the freedom of information reply by my Department referred to by the Deputy and my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 289 of 11 February 2004.</P>
    <P>The freedom of information request sought access to records regarding communications between my Department and the Irish Prison Service with representatives of companies, including Group 4 and Securicor, regarding the contracting out of aspects of the criminal justice and/or prison system, since 1 January 2000. The parliamentary question sought details of all conferences and meetings that representatives of my Department and the Irish Prison Service attended at which privatisation of prisons and criminal justice agencies have been discussed since 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>No records were identified which fell within the scope of the freedom of information request and I confirmed in my reply to the parliamentary question that no Department or Irish Prison Service officials had attended any conferences about privatisation of the prisons or criminal justice agencies over the period in question. However, I did confirm that a group of officials had visited the two companies, along with the United Kingdom Prison Service in early 2000 for the purpose of gathering information regarding how prisoner transport is organised in the UK. The officials included a higher executive officer, a Garda superintendent and a registrar in the Circuit Court. The visits by the officials were not used to explore the contracting out of services in the Irish criminal justice or prison system. The purpose of the visit was to examine how the Irish Prison Service could learn from other jurisdictions in dealing with the logistical task of transporting prisoners from prisons to courts and <Col N="1022"/>hospitals. I understand that the types of issues examined by the officials on these visits included the co-ordination of high volumes of prisoner movements, the types of vehicles used, fleet management, ensuring prisoner care and how court deadlines for the production of prisoners are met. No discussion took place about contracting out terms.</P>
    <P>I should add, for the sake of completeness, that it has now been brought to my attention by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that he has, in recent days, become aware that, in March, 2002, both Group 4 and Securicor made a presentation to officials at Irish Prison Service headquarters about the range of services they provide to the criminal justice system in the UK. This was purely an information gathering exercise. There was no follow up to this presentation and it has not featured in any of the documentation generated about outsourcing prisoner escorts in recent times. A letter clarifying the FOI request response in this matter will be sent to the requester.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Regulations setting out the circumstances on which new house grants would be paid after 14 November 2002 came into force on the day of the announcement of the abolition of the new house grant scheme. However, because of the difficulties that have been faced <Col N="1024"/>by some housing grant applicants in meeting the deadline of completing and occupying their new houses, I concluded that the fairest approach was to extend the deadline for completion, occupation and receipt of a request for payment of the grant in my Department from 13 November 2003 to Friday 2 April 2004. In returning their request for payment by the new deadline, applicants will have to produce evidence of occupation. It should be emphasised that this extension applies only to those who submitted valid applications received prior to the application deadline of 4 December 2002. Where all other conditions of the scheme are met, these applicants now have until Friday, 2 April 2004 to complete and occupy their house and return a request for payment to the Department. A new house grant will not be paid under any other circumstance.</P>
    <P>The fact that payment of the grant was dependent upon occupation of their new homes by a deadline was one of the stipulations outlined to applicants in correspondence and in media advertisements. The deadline for occupation and return of a request for payment to the Department, now the 2 April 2004, was adopted to achieve closure of the scheme, to allow re-prioritisation of this budget provision to other social and affordable housing programmes and to prevent speculative applications on houses that might not be built for years to come. The strict application of these deadlines is necessary to preserve the integrity of the scheme. Consequently, no exemptions will be provided for applicants who do not respect this deadline.</P>
    <P>Following the termination of the new house grant scheme, the Government, in budget 2003, has better targeted relief for first-time purchasers by increasing the first-time buyer ceilings up to which relief at the standard rate is available. The ceilings have increased from &euro;3,175 for a single person to &euro;4,000 and from &euro;6,350 to &euro;8,000 for a married couple. Furthermore, the period for which relief is available has been extended from five to seven years.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 to 231, inclusive, and 233 and 234 together.</P>
    <P>Decisions on disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the dormant accounts disbursement board. This is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. To date, a sum of &euro;26 million has been reclaimed under the terms of the fund. A second transfer of funds from credit institutions, together with the first transfer of moneys from life assurance policies, will take place at the end of April 2004. At this stage, however, I do not have an accurate estimate as to the likely yield from these sources in 2004 and this information will only become clearer at the end of April.</P>
    <P>The board is deciding on the disbursement of funds up to &euro;30 million. To date, it has approved 18 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;1.7 million. Approximately 290 applications have been received to date and they are being assessed on an ongoing basis by ADM on behalf of the board. The Government has not and will not be involved in decisions on such applications.</P>
    <P>In December 2003, the Government reviewed arrangements in relation to dormant accounts. This was informed by three practical considerations, namely, the organisational arrangements for the board, which involve a handful of seconded civil servants in a secretariat role, are not designed to support disbursements on the scale now emerging; governance arrangements including the legal requirement that a part time chairman should be accountable for hundreds of millions of euro, are inadequate; and to ensure value for money, spend from the fund must be co-ordinated with priorities identified by Government and debated in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the objectives of the disbursements scheme would remain unchanged, that is, funding to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons &mdash; those affected by economic and social disadvantage; those affected by educational disadvantage, and persons with a disability. The Government also decided that it would make decisions on disbursements and that such decisions would be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process. Also, appropriate arrangements would be put in place <Col N="1028"/>so that spending from the dormant accounts fund is clearly separate to Estimates provision.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that key roles in relation to advising, monitoring and planning in the area of dormant accounts have been given to the disbursement board, with particular regard to the following: advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding; preparation of the disbursement plan; and reviewing, evaluating, and reporting on the effectiveness, additionality and impact of disbursements. Draft legislation is to be brought forward this year with a view to giving effect to these decisions.</P>
    <P>In relation to Tiermohan national school community support group, I understand that no application from that organisation has been received to date. If this group wishes to apply, it should do so through ADM and its application will be assessed against the criteria as set out in the published guidelines.</P>

	<P>I am at present preparing detailed proposals on the rural social scheme to bring before the Government. To be eligible to participate a person must be on farm assist or possess a herd number and be in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, if previously on community employment, or disability allowance. Detailed guidelines for the scheme, including criteria for participation, the way it will operate, how it will be delivered at a local level, and a likely commencement date, are currently being addressed by my Department.</P>

	<P>Application for a personal public service number, PPS number, can be made at one of this Department&rsquo;s local or branch offices. When applying for a PPS number applicants are asked to complete an application form and supply documentation to establish their identity and are usually informed of their PPS number by post within five days. This notification facility applies both to Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland addresses. Applicants from Northern Ireland are requested to supply a birth certificate and an item of photographic ID, such as a full driving licence. Alternatively, they can furnish a current valid passport. Applicants are also requested to supply supporting documentation from, for example, a past employment or a previous social security claim. In addition, documentation showing current address must be presented such as a household bill, an official letter-document, a financial statement, a property lease or tenancy agreement or a verified employer letter.</P>
    <P>Where difficulties arise in individual cases, advice is available from identity services in my Department to enable applications to be expedited. Client identity services has overall responsibility for strategy and management in relation to the PPS number and client identity data.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have recently introduced a number of changes to the rent supplement scheme. The principle change is that, with certain important exceptions, new applicants are required, at the time of application, to have been in rented accommodation for at least six <Col N="1031"/>months within the preceding 12 month period in order to receive a rent supplement.</P>
    <P>Specific provision has been made to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities are fully protected in the course of implementing the new measures. In addition anyone who is assessed by a housing authority as having a housing need and who meets the existing qualifying criteria will continue to be entitled to rent supplement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case identified by the Deputy, the South Western Area Health Board was <Col N="1032"/>contacted and has advised that at the time of application the family concerned did not satisfy the six month rule. In addition, their accommodation needs had not been assessed by the local housing authority and therefore they did not have an entitlement to rent supplement. The family was advised to contact the local housing authority with a view to having their housing needs assessed. As an interim measure they were offered temporary emergency accommodation. The health board has further advised that the local housing authority subsequently assessed the family as having a housing need and as a result their application was reviewed and a rent supplement has now been awarded.</P>
