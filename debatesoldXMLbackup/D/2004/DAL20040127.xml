      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprises the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, <Col N="194"/>and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP. Legislation underpinning the establishment of NESDO has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and, when enacted, will place the three bodies on a statutory basis as part of the office.</P>
        <P>The primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be released, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication minimised. The office promotes the development of a shared vision for realising these goals and encouraging the constituent bodies to maximise their efforts through collaborative policy development initiatives.</P>
        <P>Over the past year, NESDO has overseen the provision of new accommodation for its constituent bodies in Parnell Square. All the staff of these bodies are for the first time located in one building. Not only does this facilitate the sharing by the three bodies of administrative costs and overheads, but also the sharing of knowledge and ideas and the devising of complementary work programmes. This was particularly evident during the preparation of work on the recent NESC report, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise &mdash; No. 110. Both the NESF and NCPP had a considerable input into the drafting of the report. Another example of this type of co-operation between the constituent bodies was evident over the past two months when the NCPP linked with the NESC and NESF in developing teams for each of the panels on the Forum on the Workplace of the Future.</P>
        <P>NESDO has also produced its policies and procedures statement, which defines the functions and responsibilities of NESDO regarding its constituent bodies, outlines its financial and human resources policies and procedures as well as its customer service principles. The statement is currently being circulated to all staff for their observations before formal adoption by the board of NESDO.</P>
        <P>On the NCPP specifically, the centre was established to bring about change and improved performance in both the private and public sectors, through partnership in the workplace. It is doing this firstly by developing models of good practice in the area of partnership and improved performance. Examples of the centre's work under this heading include: the publication of case studies of good practice in the private sector, which will be followed shortly by the publication of similar studies in the Civil Service; a conference last November on best practice in the area of information and consultation within organisations, which, again, will be followed by the publication of case studies covering both the public and private sectors; and ongoing work on the development of guidelines on innovative forms of employee financial involvement.</P>
        <P>A second strand of the centre's work is the development of practical supports for those involved in managing change through <Col N="195"/>partnership. Examples of the centre's work in this area include: the preparation, in association with IBEC and ICTU, of two training modules on developing partnership and on joint problem solving, for publication later this month; the development and promotion of a competency framework identifying the behaviours, attitudes and skills necessary for the effective management of change through partnership; and the establishment of an interactive facility on the centre's website designed to educate and inform those interested in improving performance through partnership.</P>
        <P>As a third strand of its work, the centre is in the business of promoting partnership and performance. Activities in this area include: the recent publication of a major review of the international experience of partnership, highlighting its value as a positive force for change; and the centre's ongoing work both with its Strategic Alliance Network, consisting of Departments and agencies concerned with workplace issues and with the Research Advisory Panel, which is a national network of leading Irish researchers in relevant disciplines.</P>
        <P>The fourth strand of the centre's work is to further develop our overall thinking on how workplaces can best adapt to competitive pressures, improve the delivery of services, and respond to the changing needs of employees. It is doing this through the recently established Forum on the Workplace of the Future, which the centre both services and oversees. The forum is the main focus of the centre's work at present. Its opening plenary session was held in Dublin Castle on 6 and 7 October and four expert panels which were established to support it have held a number of meetings, most recently on 9 December. The forum and panels are to meet next week on 5 and 6 February and the forum is scheduled to report this autumn.</P>
        <P>To assist in the work of the forum, a consultation paper was published in July and a major survey was commissioned on employer and employee attitudes and experiences. The paper and preliminary survey results are available on the centre's website, together with the centre's other publications. Over the next few months, the centre will publish the key themes and trends from the survey. The costs which have accrued to my Department since the centre's establishment in 2001 to date are just over &euro;2.26 million.</P>
        <P>On the NESC, Deputies will be aware that a new council has recently been appointed by Government, and it will continue the work on housing policy begun by the previous council. In the coming months the council will determine the remainder of its work programme for 2004, which will be done in co-operation with the two other bodies, namely, the NESF and the NCPP.</P>
        <P>During the Irish Presidency of the European Union, NESC and the European Economic and Social Committee, EESC, are jointly organising a conference entitled, Public Services: The Role of <Col N="196"/>Civil Dialogue in Provision of Quality Economic and Social Services. The conference will take place in Dublin Castle on 6 and 7 April. The conference is motivated by two challenges facing the provision of economic and social services in the European Union: the challenge of internationalisation, arising from European integration and globalisation; and the challenge of complexity, arising from the need for high-quality services tailored to citizens' needs and provided from constrained public revenues. The purpose of the conference is to consider the role of the economic and social councils, the social partners and the other components of organised civil society in addressing these challenges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for the long answer and I promise I will not put this question down again for at least six months. The Taoiseach will not have to read any script during his time as President that will beat that. I hope he knows what it means because I do not. The Taoiseach told us, &ldquo;The primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be released.&rdquo; Can the Taoiseach give us an idea what that means? For example, would it apply in the case of Aer Rianta or Dublin Bus? Would there not be a role for all this partnership, cohabitation and assistance in those companies? Sometimes one gets the impression that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, gives the same amount of thought to policy initiatives in transport areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as Britney Spears does to marriage. The Ceann Comhairle should time his interventions more appropriately. Believe it or not, this is absolutely pertinent to the question. What is the practical application of all this bureaucratic gibberish that we listened to for the first 11 minutes of Question Time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Deputy Rabbitte is not saying that the three organisations that make up NESDO are involved in bureaucratic nonsense. They all play an extremely useful role &mdash; I will not remind him who runs the three organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not write that answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They do extremely good work that is clearly focused on what they are endeavouring to do, to organise best practice and disseminate best knowledge on how good partnership, change and adaptation to change works across the public and private sectors. All the work NESDO does helps to improve both industrial relations and change management, and is relevant to all organisations because all organisations are involved. NESC works on the strategic analysis of what we do in much of our <Col N="197"/>public policy, NESF works on the social dimensions and the NCPP works on deriving best practice, based on research in other countries and case studies in Irish industry. All three function well together with a small number of staff to assist the public and private sectors. I know Deputy Rabbitte does not mean it, but they do an extremely good job. If there are faults in the system, no one in the three organisations can be blamed for them. I gave a long answer because they have been criticised in reports about what they have been doing recently and those involved are anxious that we show the good work they are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Returning to the practical application in the sundered industrial relations in Aer Rianta and the unilateral imposition of change management in various areas of the public sector, I am at a loss to understand how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, are in keeping with the long answer the Taoiseach read out. They seem to believe in the unilateral imposition of change.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the purpose of the NESDO umbrella? He published with great fanfare recently a &ldquo;less red tape&rdquo; document on regulation. The fanfare and trumpets were to signal the message that red tape was being cut back. How is this cutting back on red tape? Is the NESC still going to exist, quite distinctively and separately? Are the NESF and NCPP going to remain in separate existence? Is there any amalgamation of staff? Is the number of staff employed under the single organisation less than the number employed under the three? Do the three continue to have a separate existence? What is the point of NESDO? We are trying to establish the practical application in terms of this initiative and how it is in keeping with the Taoiseach's stated commitment to the minimisation of red tape.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is saving money. The NESC has seven people, the NESF has six and the NCPP has nine. One person has a dual role in NESDO. The director of the NESC is included in both sets of figures. He is also chief executive officer of NESDO, so that is essentially the co-ordinating body for administrative purposes. There is a saving. The budget for 2003 was less than 2002, so not only have efficiencies been achieved from the fact that the three bodies are in the one place, but money has been saved in real terms. The figure saved is 8%. This year their Estimate will be increased because they received an allocation for their major project &mdash; into which they have put enormous effort &mdash; the Forum for the Workplace of the Future. They have generated a vast amount of interest in that regard across the public and private sectors. Members of Deputy Rabbitte's party were at the launch of <Col N="198"/>one aspect of the project earlier last year and again in October.</P>
        <P>The priority of NESDO for the coming year is to promote the complementary programmes of research analysis and discussion by the three organisations that are already there. NESC has been in existence for about 30 years and the NESF for about 12 years. The NCPP is a more recent organisation. They will continue to provide shared administration and support services for the three bodies to obtain the best value for money. Each is a small organisation. I have given the number as 24 for the three bodies. They are giving value for money and making a contribution to those who engage with them, because there is a cross-over between the social and reporting objectives as carried out by the NESDO. The fact that they are working together and co-ordinating is good. All of the social partners and others who deal with them believe this is an effective process and it was widely welcomed in the House when the Bill was introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach outline the case studies to be published this year to which he referred? Following Deputy Rabbitte's question on the practical implementation of the verbiage surrounding these bodies, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance was established to support and drive change in the Irish workplace. That was designed to enable public and private partnerships to respond to change, to build capability and to improve performance. In the case referred to, it seems as if the Minister for Transport, in sending a detailed letter to the president of SIPTU, has taken unto himself all change and all partnership. In respect of the practical implementation as regards the consumer, the customer and the ordinary person, how does the Taoiseach see these bodies being able to do the job for which they were set up when Ministers send letters of comfort or letters of assumption of job stability, thereby creating confusion and conflict within workers in various semi-State bodies? Is the Taoiseach happy that the remit of the bodies referred to is working in terms of practical results and consequences for the average person on the street?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do. The three organisations, two of which have been in existence for a long time, are fulfilling their roles. NESC has been compiling reports for almost 30 years but that does not mean everybody has always agreed with them. The NESF has been doing a good job and there has been active participation by Members of this House in its work for the past 12 years. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance is highlighting best practice. There has been enormous change and many issues have been resolved through their advice and work. There will always be difficulties. These organisations are not in the business of changing the entire industrial relations structure but they can significantly help in the efforts towards <Col N="199"/>change. I could outline numerous reports and work undertaken by these organisations but I do not think that is necessary because Members are aware of them. Many of the publications issued by them illustrate the work they are doing.</P>
        <P>These organisations are modernising our workplaces, delivering more competitive and social visions and achieving higher performance in partnership works in the public service. They have provided effective learning and training programmes through the Civil Service conference and are involved in a great deal of work involving management, employers and unions. All those involved in the three organisations are fulfilling their roles and doing good work. Since the organisations came together the executive chairperson has done an excellent job and is highly thought of by employers and workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with some regret that I ask the Taoiseach if he agrees that the National Centre for Partnership and Performance is but an expensive talking shop? Is it not the case that this is a departmental quango that justifies itself through the publication of occasional bulletins and through creating meetings for the sake of creating meetings? What product does the centre produce; what is the outcome of its work?</P>
        <P>The Department of the Taoiseach suggests the centre has an important role to play in supporting and facilitating organisational change based on partnership in the public and private sectors. We are told the overall aim is to improve performance and to provide better public services and so on. Would the Taoiseach not agree that in this the 21st century, all these objectives could be achieved through two important and simple measures: the recognition of the right of employees to trade union membership; and the requirement on employers to recognise trade unions as the negotiating team of workers for workers' interests? These are the critical changes needed. Will the Taoiseach accept that it is outrageous that workers' rights in terms of trade union membership and the recognition of trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is wandering from the questions submitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not. This is a substantive area which this body has been established to address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is wandering from the substance of the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly, I wish that were the case, but it is not. I am dealing with what is at the core of this matter. Looking ahead, are these the workplaces of the future where workers' rights are not recognised and the right of trade unions to represent employees is denied?</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, which is now part of the NESDO, produced a very damning report in 2002 on equity of access to hospital care. I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the outcome of the work of the NESF and the NESDO. The report made a strong case for the evaluation of the waiting list initiative. What has been done, for example, in regard to that recommendation, given that it is now January 2004?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit his question to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The collective aim of my question is to stir some attention and interest in all this. These bodies are not being given the opportunity to make an effective contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is making a statement. He should allow the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Government refuses to implement any of their recommendations. That is the core of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For about the past 30 years the NESC has prepared the reports upon which social partnership has been based for the past 17 years and has done more than anyone else to influence the key policies of successive Governments in that time. The current report addresses very effectively housing issues. Were any of the reports to be examined it would be seen that they have influenced thinking in Departments, at the Cabinet table and in society. They have driven the approach to many social, economic and environmental issues.</P>
        <P>For the past 12 years, NESF has driven social issues such as unemployment. It was set up to deal with such issues at a time when we had the highest level of unemployment in the history of the State, approximately 360,000 people. A great many Members of the Oireachtas are involved in the organisation, therefore, it is not necessary for me to outline its work because Members are familiar with it.</P>
        <P>The NCPP works to help the process of change, moving away from a time when everything ended up with industrial disputes and management made decisions without the involvement of workers. It has followed good case studies and carried out excellent work in recent years. The NCPP is a successor to a group which was in place for the previous six or seven years. The body has done outstanding work.</P>
        <P>I will not do so but I could list two pages of major public and private companies with which the organisation has worked. I will list the first half dozen companies to demonstrate the extent of its involvement: Abbott plc, Allianz, Allied <Col N="201"/>Irish Banks, Aughinish Alumina, Bausch and Lomb, Beaumont Hospital and Cavan County Council. The NCPP engaged with these companies to bring to the organisations best industrial relations and change practice. It is significantly involved in driving this change.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I understand why my officials supplied me with such a long reply &mdash; they felt Deputies were not aware of the purpose or value of the organisations, and that is clear now. The collective work of these organisations, the experience of the people behind them and the executive chairpersons' effort is enormous. The system is also cost-effective since the organisations were already in place and have come together with a small staff. They are not trying to solve the industrial relations problems of the entire country &mdash; other agencies are in place to do so &mdash; but to force the process of change, and they are doing so very well.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>Any of the reports which the organisations have prepared, including those to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred, will go to the relevant Departments for action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then will the Government not legislate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That happens in an effective manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the National Economic and Social Development office incorporates the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, is the Taoiseach aware that the director of that centre said last year that there is growing evidence that involving and empowering employees through partnership builds trust and good relations? Does the Taoiseach agree that the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; for the Government is similar to the word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;, rather like nylon stockings that can be stretched to fit all sizes and occasions, even to make a balaclava behind which the identity and purpose can be hidden? How does he reconcile his commitment to partnership and that of these organisations with the actions and policy of his Ministers which are directly contrary to such commitment, whether they be the bullying of prison officers by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the bullying of transport workers by the Minister for Transport?</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
        <P>In particular, what confidence can workers have in the Government in the context of what the Taoiseach states is his commitment to partnership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions relate to two agencies. The Deputy should ask a supplementary question appropriate to the seven questions tabled.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="202"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What confidence can workers have in the aims of these organisations when, for example, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources blatantly reneged on an agreement with post office workers that was signed, sealed and delivered in regard to the employee shared ownership? I must come down to the specifics because we want to hear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Supplementary questions must be related to the questions tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as the Taoiseach is allowed to give rambling replies and use generalities and synergies and so on which are in contrast to the policies enacted by his Ministers, we will not obtain the information we need. I have asked a valid question as to how the policies of the Government, especially that of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources regarding post office workers, sit with what the Taoiseach stated in his opening reply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should table a question to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Joe Higgins looked at the questions being discussed, he would see that I answer the questions I am asked. Good partnership arrangements, as enunciated by these agencies, should be followed. That does not mean that there will not occasionally be friction about implementing policy or trying to organise change. That is inevitable but it should be done on the best basis. Information should be exchanged and there should be proper dialogue because people should try to work out issues together. That is the Government's policy.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach stated that, if there are faults in the system, they do not relate to the three organisations. Those of us who see the Government as a problem agree with that statement. Is the Taoiseach teaching the National Economic and Social Council a lesson in coping with competitive pressure by reducing its funding? Is that an effort to get the council to see how far it can stretch its resources or is it a diminution of its significance and a Government message in that regard?</P>
        <P>Regarding recommendations made by agencies such as the NESC, can the Taoiseach instance a recommendation that has been implemented and one that has not? Does he agree that the attitude of the Government to recommendations generally from the NESC is similar to the popular attitude to the Bible? Whatever measures suit the <i>status quo</i> are implemented and those that bring about equity and sustainabilty but upset a few vested interests, such as the NESC's recommendation to introduce more carbon taxes rather than labour taxes, are seen as too difficult <Col N="203"/>for the Government to act on. However, given that it was an NESC recommendation, does this indicate the Government is picking and choosing and not taking the council seriously?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When Deputy Rabbitte asked if there was cost effectiveness, I answered that there was a saving of 8.3%. Combining the three organisations made a saving.</P>
        <P>The agreements reached in all the NESC reports of the past 17 years, but especially the last five or six on social partnership, have formed the basis for the implementation of policy. The reports were, by and large, accepted almost whole in partnership discussions. That happened with the most recent agreement, Sustaining Progress. Recently, when I attended the 30th anniversary of the NESC, it was pointed out that the council had advocated the tax credit system at the same time as the Commission on Taxation did so. Many of the council's policies have been implemented.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I informed the House in my reply of 15 October 2003, the high level group on regulation <Col N="204"/>has made considerable progress since its establishment in May 2001 following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has focused on two areas in particular.</P>
        <P>The first is the formulation of a White Paper on better regulation. As Deputies may be aware, I launched the White Paper on Tuesday, 20 January. I understand that copies were circulated to all Deputies and placed in the Oireachtas Library. The White Paper sets out six core principles of better regulation: necessity, effectiveness, proportionality, transparency, accountability and consistency. Application of these principles will enable our economy to perform better and improve the quality of public services.</P>
        <Miles com="ah" />
        <P>The White Paper also sets out a detailed action plan to translate these principles into how we design, implement and review legislation and regulations. Key actions include the introduction of regulatory impact analysis, RIA. This will be a major improvement to the way new regulations are made. Departments and offices will assess and quantify the likely impacts of major new regulations and will consult more widely and consistently before making regulations, especially with consumers when they are likely to be affected. Consideration will be given to the downstream compliance and enforcement consequences of regulations, including monitoring and review mechanisms where appropriate.</P>
        <Miles com="xh" />
        <P>New systematic reviews of existing regulations in key areas will take place and an ongoing series of reviews will be undertaken. This will involve assessing the adequacy and relevance of existing regulations and the regulatory arrangements and agencies that are in place in specific key areas of the economy and society.</P>
        <P>Improvements to our approach to sectoral regulation will be made. This will include establishing new independent regulators only if the requirement for an existing regulator can be clearly demonstrated and if responsibility for the sector in question cannot be assigned to an existing regulator. There will also be a review of the existing arrangements for appeal of decisions made by sectoral regulators to try to speed up implementation of important infrastructural projects.</P>
        <P>There will be a renewed drive to tackle red tape. Departments and offices will be asked to simplify and streamline their administrative processes and to report specifically on targets and progress in their strategy statements and annual reports.</P>
        <P>We will have greater clarity and accessibility of regulation, including publishing new explanatory guides to Acts which have major implications for consumers and citizens. A major programme of statute law revision will be undertaken to bring the Statute Book up to date and make it easier to find the law relating to specific issues. A new <Col N="205"/>better regulation group will be established to oversee implementation of the actions outlined in the White Paper and to report back to the Government on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>The second priority of the high level group and a key action point in the White Paper is the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis, RIA, as recommended by the OECD in its report. RIA is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has developed an approach to RIA that would be suitable for piloting in the Irish legislative and policy-making context.</P>
        <P>A small number of volunteer Departments will be sought to allow regulatory impact analysis to be piloted in the months ahead. Ultimately, the wider introduction of RIA across all Departments and offices will be supported by the preparation of detailed guidance material and supports and delivery of a programme of awareness raising and training.</P>
        <P>The publication of a White Paper on regulation and the introduction of regulatory impact assessment across Departments are two of the commitments on regulatory reform contained in Sustaining Progress. Overall, we are making inroads in the area of better regulation and I look forward to even more progress in the coming years in accordance with the principles and actions outlined in the White Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Again this is very dense and impenetrable stuff. It is very difficult to know whether it will have any tangible impact. Now that the Taoiseach has published the White Paper, which starts with an amazing opening sentence stating that the Government is not &ldquo;for or against&rdquo; regulation and that rather the Government favours better regulation, where do we go from here? Are there likely to be statutory instruments or primary legislation derived from the publication of the White Paper?</P>
        <P>I note what the Taoiseach said about RIA being a tool to quantify and measure new regulations. What is the practical impact since the publication of the OECD report? What progress has been made in regulatory reform in any of the major areas of the economy? We have deregulated taxis as a result of a decision of the High Court. Is it not the case that the Government has very shabbily treated the unfortunate casualties of that &mdash; a small number of taxi plate holders who have suffered serious loss for a variety of reasons? Other than tackling the taxi service operated by working class men generally, where else have we made any steps forward?</P>
        <P>What is the situation with regard to the professions, pubs and a number of other areas where action was promised but no action has been taken? We know what has happened recently with telecoms. Do we have any handle <Col N="206"/>on regulation in that area? Is it not the case that the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann has been an unmitigated disaster for almost everybody involved? We now have a duopoly that is increasing its tariff rates every time it thinks about it and the regulatory framework does not seem to be able to get a handle on it. Are these not the tangible matters that have a bearing on the economy in terms of competitiveness, etc.? How does the publication of the Taoiseach's White Paper advance those issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked me a number of questions concerning what actions will take place. I will put simply the overall issue before I come to the individual issues the Deputy mentioned. In 1999 following the OECD studies, we started this process to get better regulation. We were one of the first countries to take up this issue. A great number of countries are taking it up now and have done so in the past few years.</P>
        <P>The assessments of how it could work better were carried out up to 2001. A number of areas were looked at &mdash; professional services, electricity, gas, the liberalisation of pharmacies, etc. This has been examined in several areas. The basis of the White Paper is that whenever we set up any regulation or legislation, we should look to see if there is another way. We should examine whether it is necessary to legislate or have a statutory instrument or whether there is a simpler and more efficient way.</P>
        <P>The OECD argued that up to 7% of GDP could be generated in a society where there is a regulatory system that does not just impose burdens and costs. That seems a particularly high figure because every 1% would mean &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy. Regardless of whether that is right, the assessment is correct. When we want to do something, we should not just impose burdens on citizens, be they employers, trade unionists or individuals. We should consider whether there is a simpler way to proceed. That aspect relates to all new legislation, statutory instruments and regulations. It would not be very difficult to achieve and the regulatory impact assessment and the model set out in the White Paper are simple enough to allow it to be done in the future.</P>
        <P>The second point relates to all old Acts. The high level group, which will begin its review in this area with pre-1922 Acts, of which there are hundreds that date back centuries, believes that these should be brought up to date. The answer to the Deputy's question as to whether, in the context of the Statute of Limitations, there will be new legislation to regulate these is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The group is considering if this can be done in a collective way, rather than by dealing with hundreds of Acts individually. It is looking at updating the Statute Book, and keeping it updated, in omnibus fashion but also at getting rid of these hundreds of Acts, many of which are <Col N="207"/>used, in one form or another, in the courts each day. That will be useful for businesses and individuals in terms of knowing exactly what is law in this country.</P>
        <Miles com="ah" />
        <P>The third point relates to the areas to which the Deputy referred, namely, telecommunications, electricity, pharmacies, public house and professional services. Work has been ongoing in respect of these areas since 2001. I share his view that while the Competition Authority commenced work on the professional services study in May 2001 by examining eight professions, including those of engineers, architects, dentists and veterinarians, it has been slow in finalising its studies. However, it has produced its reports and is involved in the ongoing discussions. The consultants' report was published last March. Those involved have since been using that report as a basis for their work. The Competition Authority has been engaged in consultations and has issued recommendations on each of the professions. Its reports in respect of these matters have not been produced yet. I may be being unfair by saying that and some of the reports may have been forthcoming but I do not believe that they have been produced in most cases.</P>
        <Miles com="xh" />
        <P>Apart from the White Paper, the work in respect of these eight professional areas is continuing and the reports and recommendations relating to them will be published in the summer. I am aware that the paper relating to the legal profession is to be published in May, while others will be published either prior to that date or later.</P>
        <P>On electronic communications, there are approximately five directives involving changes currently in existence. With regard to electricity, there are a number of regulations which arise out of this work. In the area of telecommunications, there are directives coming forward. All of that work from the OECD report is being progressed, albeit slowly, by the Competition Authority and the agencies involved. Regulations relating to pharmacies and liquor licences have been published. The final one relating to liquor licences, the codification of the legislation which contains approximately six sections, has been completed. While the work is slow, it is useful.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact analysis does not merely involve publishing the White Paper for the benefit of agencies and Departments in the future and allowing other matters to drift. The high level group has provided a model which must be followed. In any legislative areas where there is discussion or debate in the future, before we arrive at the final process the type of analysis I have outlined must be undergone. This will, I hope, mean that there will be less regulation. It is not a question of deregulation, it is about better regulation or finding an alternative way to proceed. The report points out that the plastic bag levy was not a question of enforcement or penalties but that a policy decision was made and <Col N="208"/>incentives introduced to allow matters to move a particular way. Other examples are also set out in the report.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Rabbitte's description of it as heavy stuff. However, in Europe and throughout the world, when Governments move away from tax reform because it has worked its way through the system, they use regulatory analysis as a means of achieving greater efficiency and more competition. The work we have done in this White Paper is to gear that towards the Irish model.</P>
        <P>I thank the members and officials in the working groups for their work on this. I do not claim to have had any input into the paper but I appreciate the people who have worked on it. They produced a White Paper which is far simpler than some of the contents of the OECD report two years ago.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the plans that are in place and the amount of money allocated in 2004 to ensure access by all who need it to a comprehensive neurology service.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al established a committee to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, existing arrangements for the provision of consultant level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and to make recommendations on the future organisation and development of those services. Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al has now published its report and, having considered it, I am happy to endorse its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The report recommends significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology <Col N="209"/>services, including increases in consultant manpower. It also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al has recommended that a national multidisciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework on the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its publications, will offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country. My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association on the future development of services. The implementation of the recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area and in the context of competing funding priorities.</P>
        <P>Specialty costing data in respect of hospitals which provide neurology services indicate that in-patient costs for this specialty for 2002 were over &euro;19 million. This figure excludes costs in respect of neurology services provided in out-patient and accident and emergency departments and specialist day case activity, which are not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect to claim that the report has just been published &mdash; it was published last spring. I am concerned about what has happened since then. It appears the Minister has simply commissioned yet another report, the review of rehabilitation services. While that is welcome, it does not indicate that there has been any significant progress in appointing neurologists. The review showed that Ireland is yet again at the bottom of the league, as it were, with the smallest ratio of neurologists to population. We have less than one third of the required number of neurologists. What has been done to provide additional neurologists since the report was published? How many neurologists have been approved or appointed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to consider how many additional consultants can be appointed in the context of the funding envelope that is available for this year and forthcoming years. There is a significant lead-in time from the date of <Col N="210"/>sanctioning a consultant post to the post coming on stream. Generally, our consultant numbers across a range of specialties are below what pertains in other countries. That was the reason for the Hanly programme, the need for change in the consultants' contracts and the aim of doubling the number of consultants. There is caution, therefore, about making further dramatic increases in consultant numbers in certain specialties in advance of dealing with those critical issues.</P>
        <P>There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of consultants in the critical areas of cancer, cardiovascular and accident and emergency medicine. Unprecedented numbers of consultants were appointed. I will have to examine the financial envelope this year to see what can be done to advance the cause of neurology. I acknowledge the need for additional consultants in this area. The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report was published too late for last year's financial envelope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware there is a long lead-in time from the time of sanction. That is the reason I asked if any appointments had been sanctioned. The Minister must be aware that neurological diseases can be treated and managed and the progress of the diseases can be postponed. The patient's quality of life can be immeasurably improved if the patient gets access to a neurologist and the neurologist's support team. The Minister said he opposes a dramatic increase in the numbers. I accept that this must be done in a planned and phased way, but has there been any increase? Is there any sense of urgency?</P>
        <P>This is yet another specialty in which there is under-provision. The Minister spoke about the Hanly report and doubling the number of consultants, but this report has confirmed gross under-provision in neurology without an input from Hanly. However, there are no new consultants after more than eight months and there is no sign of any posts being sanctioned. Every day people are diagnosed with serious neurological illnesses and their outcomes are diminished by the fact that they cannot see a neurologist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not dispute the need for additional consultants in neurology. However, I will have to examine how many additional posts can be sanctioned within the financial envelope available to me this year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if he has carried out or received any assessment of the casemix system that he is applying to hospitals, which is penalising patients awaiting treatment and causing further cuts in the budgets of certain <Col N="211"/>hospitals, especially in the greater Dublin area where there are already severe problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2104/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The casemix budget model is an internationally developed system, in use since the 1980s and at present used in most developed countries for health funding. As was stated in the health strategy &ldquo;... the most developed system for assessing comparative efficiency and for creating incentives for good performance is Casemix.&rdquo; The casemix model is considered to be the only model capable of dealing with the complexities of resource allocation within the hospital services. Every year major improvements to the system are developed with the assistance of all the hospitals involved and in response to their needs and changing clinical practice. A comprehensive review of the national casemix programme has been carried out by the casemix unit of my Department. This review has taken place in an open and inclusive manner and included consultation with all the stakeholders in the process, including hospital managers and clinicians.</P>
        <P>The intention of the review was to ensure that the system is fair, accurate and robust enough to incorporate all the strategic developments being proposed in the medium term. A report on the matter is being prepared at present which will make recommendations for the enhancement of the model. This will result in Ireland having one of the most advanced casemix systems in the world, while still being an &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; system for Irish patients.</P>
        <P>On the matter of casemix penalising patients awaiting treatment, casemix has resulted in more rather than fewer patients being treated year on year. In the period 1999 to 2001, for example, where direct comparison is available, the numbers treated as in-patients and day cases in casemix hospitals rose by 72,829. With regard to some Dublin hospitals losing funding, many of the hospitals that lost some funding under the programme this year gained significant funding in other years. The Adelaide and Meath Hospitals incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, for example, lost funding last year but gained this year. The Mater hospital gained funding this year yet lost funding last year.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the use of casemix systems as part of the budgetary process is the wish to base funding on measured costs and activity, rather than on less objective systems of resource allocation, and to fund hospitals based on their &ldquo;mix&rdquo; of cases. In other words, a hospital should be funded for the patients they treat. The programme is operated in an open and transparent fashion and full details of the clinical and financial information on which casemix budget adjustments are based is provided to all participating hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="212"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody argues with the aim of making hospitals efficient. However, does the Minister accept that the current casemix system does not provide an accurate gauge whereby it can be ensured that more problems are not created for hospitals under pressure, especially in the Dublin area? The result of the Minister's approach in the east coast area has been penal. More than &euro;2 million has been taken away from two key hospitals, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown. That must impact on patient care.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that it is not a case of inefficiency in these hospitals but that a high number of elderly patients are blocking beds because there are insufficient rehabilitation units? That is a direct result of the Minister's failure to provide such beds. Does he also acknowledge that these hospitals have complied with the appropriate public private balance of 80% and 20%? Other hospitals have disregarded that balance and have catered more for private patients who do not stay in hospital as long as public patients. They are usually not as sick or as old as public patients. The Minister may be rewarding hospitals which care more for private patients than for public patients and which provide for acute cases in accident and emergency departments because they do not have reserve beds.</P>
        <P>I know this is technical, but perhaps the Minister would recognise that the result of what he has done is to penalise hospitals which are already under pressure. Approximately 2,400 patients are waiting for care in St. Vincent's Hospital. It is a major hospital which deals with cancer patients and is subject to huge demand from patients in the locality and its catchment area. It is also a tertiary hospital, yet it is taking a hit of more than &euro;1.2 million. That must be absorbed within the hospital and, inevitably, will impact on patient care.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is carrying out the review, which I welcome. He must also carry out an equally forensic survey of the impact of this approach. What evidence is there that benefits accrue to patients when hospitals are rewarded? The Minister is rewarding Letterkenny General Hospital, for example, which is great for it. However, that is not of comfort to the thousands of people trying to access services in St. Vincent's Hospital. A young woman I met through my clinic needs a colostomy reversal operation and cannot get into St. Vincent's Hospital because there are no beds. She was told she had to have the operation within a year. It is now the last month of that year and there is no sign that she will receive the necessary treatment. By fining St. Vincent's Hospital, the Minister is ensuring that there is less chance of such patients' needs being met quickly.</P>
        <P>As regards the review, I urge the Minister to examine the context in which these hospitals <Col N="213"/>operate and how they ensure that public patients are treated fairly, unlike many other hospitals which are being rewarded under the casemix system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the attempts to personalise the casemix process as &ldquo;his approach&rdquo;, that is, the Minister's approach. It has been the approach of successive Governments and is an internationally accepted model. I cannot claim credit for inventing the casemix model.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not walk away from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not. We must be fair in our assessment and in terms of informing the public as to how this happened. I have often been lectured in the House and people have correctly commented about the need to be vigilant in maintaining value for money. This is probably the one model which attempts to achieve a value for money efficiency approach to the organisation of acute hospital activity.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy's point about length of stay, the hospitals are not penalised for excessive length of stay and are not given credit for quick patient turnover. It is about the cost per case for the same case across hospitals. The costs are higher for the same type of case in some hospitals compared with others. Hospitals can make submissions. Accident and emergency departments place a significant degree of pressure on certain hospitals compared with others. These factors can be taken into account in the casemix model.</P>
        <P>There is a need to modernise and enhance the model because there has been a comprehensive review of it. However, we have also examined other models, especially the Australian model, with a view to adapting them to the Irish situation. A report has almost been completed and submitted to the Secretary General of the Department. I have not seen the full report yet but, when I do, it will be sent to the Government for decision.</P>
        <P>The argument that we are reducing patients' chances does not stand up. Additional patients are treated year on year in many hospitals under the casemix model. Using comparable figures, there was an increase of 72,000 patients for the years 1999 to 2001. There has been an ongoing increase in patient numbers year on year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the details of the new income guidelines for medical card qualification; and if it is intended to extend qualification as promised before the general election in 2002.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1789/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The medical card income guidelines issued by the chief executive officers of the health boards for 2004 are effective from 1 January 2004. They are as follows: a single person aged up to 65 years and living alone &mdash;&euro;142.50; a single person aged between 66 and 69 years and living alone &mdash;&euro;156; a single person aged up to 65 years and living with a family &mdash;&euro;127; a single person aged between 66 and 69 years of age and living with a family &mdash;&euro;134; a married couple aged up to 65 years &mdash;&euro;206.50; and a married couple aged between 66 and 69 years &mdash;&euro;231. The allowance for children under 16 years is &euro;26 and is &euro;27 for a dependant aged more than 16 years with no income maintained by the applicant. The allowance for outgoings on house, rent, etc. is &euro;26, and for reasonable expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to work the allowance is &euro;23.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, especially children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation, I regret it is not possible to meet this commitment this year, but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the next election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in terms of issuing medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would <Col N="215"/>justify it. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
        <P>The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Shorter waiting times for public patients are prioritised with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of the national treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people, initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers, refugees and prisoners and the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy targets relating to health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am almost speechless as a result of the Minister's response. I will do him one little courtesy by not referring to the Government's pre-2002 general election promise to extend the medical card to more than 200,000 additional people because he is already sufficiently discredited on that point.</P>
        <P>The Government's health strategy, under what it calls, &ldquo;National Goal No. 2 &mdash; Fair Access&rdquo;, promises to increase income guidelines for medical cards. Last year a married couple aged up to 65 years were entitled to a medical card if their income was under &euro;200. However, the Minister has indicated in his reply that that figure has been increased by &euro;6.50 for the current year, which is a 3.25% increase. Was that the best the Minister could do? If a married couple with two children under 16 years of age have an income of &euro;260 per week, they will not qualify for a medical card.</P>
        <P>Under the Minister's guidelines families with young children regularly face a terrible choice. To visit a GP costs between &euro;30 and &euro;50 depending on where in the country one is domiciled. Families must choose which of their daily needs to do without to visit a GP with a sick child. Up to one fifth and in some cases one quarter of a weekly income is spent on the GP visit alone, before the cost of medication. The figures the Minister has announced for 2004 continue a pattern that is removed from the reality of the daily living conditions of ordinary people and contributes to the basis of ill-health. Real needs, particularly those of children, which the Minister emphasised, are not being addressed because of the terrible and stark choices facing families.</P>
        <P>How does the Minister morally justify the extension of the medical card to all over the age of 70, regardless of income or means, while children up to the age of 18 years, some living in <Col N="216"/>real or relative poverty, do not have the benefit of a medical card? I do not believe that the Minister can morally justify that. This is a very serious matter affecting an increasing number of people because the curtailments and restrictions introduced on the medical card leave people in real poverty on a daily basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is medically established that people over 70 have far greater need to visit their GPs than those under 70, perhaps with the exception of young children. The Deputy voted in this House for the measure that he now finds morally reprehensible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government gave this commitment and I regret it is not in a position to deal with it this year, but there has been fiscal confinement or restraint for the past two years. I have concentrated on other areas of our commitments, particularly to have public patients treated faster. Soon we will reach the point where 12,000 who had been waiting longer than 12 months will have been treated by the national treatment purchase fund, to which we allocated &euro;30 million. The cost of the GMS has risen dramatically in the past two years, from &euro;890 million in 2002 to &euro;1.2 billion. These are all factors at which we have been looking and we have been drilling deeply into the GMS scheme to see if we can effect savings that can be returned to the people whom the Deputy mentioned. The significant escalation of the GMS, however, cannot go unnoticed or uncommented on, or be tossed aside as if it has no application to the decisions we take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There are fewer people in the GMS scheme today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

        <Quest>if he will set up a public independent investigation into the midlands psychiatric hospital in which a mildly autistic person was allegedly repeatedly raped; his views on the opinion of the rape crisis network that sexual violence against persons with disabilities in residential institutions is prevalent; and if he will investigate the extent of this and appoint an independent inspectorate which has the expertise and authority to identify whether residential settings can protect the human rights of residents.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1696/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>An independent inspectorate of psychiatric hospitals has existed for many years, under the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act 1945. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals, Dr. Dermot Walsh, who is retiring this year, has for many years inspected our psychiatric hospitals and issued detailed reports on matters arising from his inspections, including those pertaining to patients' human rights.</P>
        <P>This year, a new inspector of mental health services, Dr. Teresa Carey, has taken office. Dr. Carey, who is employed by the Mental Health Commission, has a broad remit under the Mental Health Act 2001 to inspect all facilities where mental health services are provided. Under section 55 of the Mental Health Act 2001 the Minister may request the Mental Health Commission to cause the inspector to inquire into any matter in respect of which an inquiry is appropriate. Yesterday, I invoked my powers under the Act and formally requested the commission to inquire into the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Midland Health Board informs me that, to date, it has received no formal allegation of rape in this case. The board has indicated in writing to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it will co-operate fully with any Garda investigation and will respect the primary role of the garda&iacute; in investigating allegations of a criminal nature. The board has also taken steps to investigate the matters which fall within its control and to establish an independent review group to review the care this former patient received while in its care. In <Col N="218"/>particular, this group will review all pertinent matters concerning this former patient while in the care of mental health services in the Midland Health Board, investigate allegations made on behalf of the former patient by her father and review the response of the board's mental health services to previous complaints made by this patient's father on her behalf while she was in the care of those services. The group will make any recommendations deemed appropriate on the board's care management systems, processes and services and submit a report to the board's chief executive officer.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, the transfer of patients with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals is ongoing. The transfer programme aims to provide more appropriate care settings and enhanced levels of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals. In his report for the year ended December 2002, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals acknowledges and details the considerable progress made in recent years in transferring such patients to appropriate facilities.</P>
        <P>I remain committed to ensuring that all persons with intellectual disability receive appropriate care and treatment in suitable facilities. I have no evidence to support the assertion that sexual violence against persons with disabilities in residential institutions is prevalent and urge any agency with evidence to this effect to make such evidence available to the appropriate authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and welcome the announcement that the commission to investigate this case has been set up. We look forward to a speedy conclusion of that investigation and a report on it. Is the Minister of State concerned at the statement of the rape crisis network and, although he says he has no knowledge of the fact, that such an organisation should state that sexual violence against people with disabilities in residential institutions is prevalent? Research highlighted the difficulty women with learning difficulties had in gaining access to medical, psychological and legal help when sexually abused as there was a culture of disbelief. Will the Minister examine that issue because the rape crisis network and CARI have expressed concern about it? Is he concerned at the statement that the greater the level of disability the greater the risk of sexual violence &mdash; in most cases this refers to rape?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Anybody would be concerned and the Government would be especially so if there were substantiated allegations of sexual violence against residents in any institution. If the Deputy or those organisations which have made statements have evidence to substantiate these allegations I will investigate them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="219"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be concerned that such bodies as the rape crisis network and CARI would publicly make such statements about these places, rather than looking for information on specific events which these organisations may not have permission to reveal. In such circumstances many families would not reveal that information because of the difficulties it might create for the victims. There is an onus on the Minister to investigate the statements of eminent bodies which suggest that sexual violence is prevalent in such institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my reply, Dr. Dermot Walsh was an inspector for many years, and we now have a new inspector, Dr. Teresa Carey. She regularly inspects all aspects of care in our institutions, as did Dr. Walsh for many years. I will bring to her attention the statements made by these bodies, and if there is any substance to the allegations, I will do my best to ensure they are examined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that if this is happening, it is without the knowledge of the institutions. If there is a problem, the institutions may not be fully aware of it. The inspector may call annually to examine books and so on, but the concern is that if something is happening without the institutions knowing of it, it may not come to the attention of the inspector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to delay the House, but as the Deputy knows, allegations such as those to which he refers are extremely difficult to prove. Allegations have been made in the past which have not been substantiated. I have responsibilities to the employees in the institutions as well as to patients, and I am aware of unsubstantiated allegations made against specific people in institutions. I am also aware, as is the Deputy, of certain cases where unsubstantiated allegations were made against some employees. That causes major problems, not only for the employees but for their families and the health boards. One has to be extremely careful in examining any of these allegations.</P>

        <Quest>when he expects the draft regulations regarding smoking in the workplace to come into operation; if any comments have been submitted or objections raised by other EU member states; the procedures that will be put in place to monitor and ensure compliance with the regulations; the planned start-up date for implementation of the prohibition on smoking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2105/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A report commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority on the health effects of <Col N="220"/>environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace was published in January 2003. This report was prepared by an independent scientific working group. The conclusions of the expert group are quite blunt on the risks to health from environmental tobacco smoke. Environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of cancer, heart disease and respiratory problems. Employees need to be protected from exposure at work. Current ventilation technology is ineffective at removing the risk to health. Legislative measures are required to protect workers from the adverse effects of exposure.</P>
        <P>A draft of regulations to prohibit smoking in the workplace was notified to the Commission in April 2003, and during the three-month standstill period, which allows member states to voice opinions on the measure, no objections or reservations were put forward. The Commission was notified of two amendments to the draft regulations in November 2003 to allow for exemptions for prisons and outdoor work areas and for psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, certain charitable institutions and sleeping accommodation in hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast accommodation. As a result of these amendments, it was necessary to change the commencement date for the introduction of the ban. The standstill period for the amendments notified will end on 4 February and 16 February 2004.</P>
        <P>Surveys carried out by the Office of Tobacco Control show widespread support for smoke-free workplaces, and the trade union movement is strongly in favour of the measure.</P>
        <P>The owner, manager or person in charge of a workplace is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements, including the prohibition on smoking in the workplace. As part of the process of monitoring compliance with the smoke-free workplace requirement, authorised officers from the health boards and the Office of Tobacco Control will visit premises. I expect that the vast majority of employers, employees and the public will respect the new measures which are primarily to protect people from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. I will make a decision on the new date for commencement of the smoke-free workplace regulations in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that he is being criticised for creating a political and administrative muddle that has now become a farce, that this is not my criticism but that of the media, and that he has shown himself to be remarkably inept in trying to achieve a goal supported by the Opposition and approximately 60% of the population? Despite such considerable support &mdash; I cannot say the same for the support he receives from his backbenchers &mdash; he has failed abysmally to deliver the ban he promised. Why can he not tell us when the ban <Col N="221"/>will become law? He has had to revoke the date he set. I understand the ban was to be introduced on 4 January. He has twice amended the statutory instrument, a sign of the muddling and bungling in an area for which he is responsible.</P>
        <P>Regarding the implementation of the regulations, there remains an issue which he has again failed to deal with. Who will monitor workplaces other than those where food and drink are sold? This is not within the Minister's competence, as it is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but I would like him to answer the question. It is clear these workplaces will not be monitored by environmental health officers, nor by staff of the Health and Safety Authority, without new legislation, as I understand it. Does the Minister propose to introduce &mdash; at some stage &mdash; a ban on smoking in the workplace without the means and staff to implement it in a large sector of working environments which do not include pubs and bars in restaurants and hotels?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the charges made by the Deputy regarding the introduction of the ban. We have had a very significant debate over the past year which has resulted in a significant public consensus being built up. I and others engaged in that debate in order to convince people of the merits of this approach. The ban will be a major milestone in public health legislation in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

	<P>I gave the Deputy latitude to make her points without interruption. I am keeping my eye on the big picture, which is the introduction of this measure. It is a very significant milestone in terms of protection of public health and one which people want to see implemented.</P>
        <P>When we debated these regulations, all the Members on the other side of the House implored me to grant exemptions for the areas I have mentioned, such as psychiatric nursing homes. We took a cautious approach in deciding <Col N="222"/>to create legal exemptions as per the regulations. Under the European transparency directive, they must be notified to Brussels. Even though the main regulations have been notified without any objections or observations, and one might argue that there was no need to notify the exemptions, we did so in order to be safe. The standstill period will end shortly. No objections, opinions or reservations have been articulated. Once the standstill period ends, we will be able to give a definitive date. It is wise to wait until the standstill period concludes, particularly relating to 4 February, and that is one of the issues which is a factor in terms of the definitive date being announced.</P>
        <P>We sought legal advice on cross-authorisation, and the Office of Tobacco Control has powers under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act to cross-authorise. We are in discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Health and Safety Authority regarding the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>As the House is aware, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</P>
        <P>As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm on the matters relevant to his investigations.</P><Col N="223"/>
        <P>Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60-page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses. I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties identified, it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would access publicly available material and seek the assistance of persons and bodies willing to co-operate with such investigation. The committees of investigation Bill may provide an appropriate mechanism for this inquiry. Other legal avenues are also being explored in consultation with the Attorney General and the legal representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
        <P>I intend to maintain contact with the Irish Haemophilia Society on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately, it bears a remarkable similarity to the answers to questions on the same issue which I have been asking for some time. We all understand the difficulties. At the end of the debate on the Lindsay tribunal report more than two years ago, the Minister stated that in his view it was possible to carry out an investigation and that he was consulting with the Attorney General. Since then there does not appear to have been any progress in that regard. To be fair to those who have suffered so much, it is important that real progress is made and that there is some firm commitment, even if it is for a limited investigation, that this will be carried out and a timeframe attached to it.</P>
        <P>We all understand that it may be difficult to access the full information because people have a lot to hide. However, that should not deter the Minister. The longer this goes on, the more likely it is that it will simply fade and people will not remember the importance of the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern. I said at the conclusion of my reply that other legal avenues are being explored. Other issues arose in the past year, to which I am not privy, which legal representatives brought to our attention in regard to the HIV potential alternative route. This issue is still under consideration.</P>

        <Quest>when the information health <Col N="224"/>strategy promised for 2001 will be published.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft memorandum for Government for the national health information strategy was circulated to Departments for observations in December 2003. My Department is currently considering the observations received with a view to an early submission to the Government of the national health information strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a bit concerned about this issue. The reason the question was tabled is that the health information strategy is now three years overdue. Following the strategy, I presume some sort of a plan for its implementation must be drawn up, yet there is neither strategy nor plan in place. I welcome the fact that a considerable sum of money has been allocated this year for investment in an information strategy for the health service. As the Minister is aware, this has been grossly lacking and it has resulted in very expensive mistakes being made in regard to the absence of data.</P>
        <P>Has a decision been made on how to spend the money allocated for this year? Has it been made in the absence of an overall plan, given that this is a once-off investment which will determine how the system can be administered and the kind of information that will be available for making decisions in the future? It is vital to have a coherent plan in place for the spending of the money. Have tenders been sought for a contract? What is the brief? Where is it intended to spend the money? Have outstanding issues regarding privacy, human rights and so on been resolved? How and when does he expect the money to be spent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not three years. The health strategy was concluded in November 2001, which amounts to a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If something ends at the end of one year and is moved to the first month of the next year, it becomes three years.</P>
        <P>Widespread consultation was necessary with various Government Departments, hospitals and the health system generally. There were significant issues in regard to the Data Protection Office such as the utilisation of the PPS number which still requires a resolution. That necessitated a certain amount of work. The work is done on the strategy. We ringfenced significant additional funding for the implementation of the health information strategy, beginning in 2004. It is not once-off funding. Significant ongoing funding will be required.</P><Col N="225"/>
        <P>On the Deputy's question, although it does not affect the national health information strategy, tenders went out for a specific software package in terms of the collection of information on hospital activities. No decision has been taken on accepting or spending the money. I can supply the Deputy with further information.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 164 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>The health sector reform programme has implications for all organisations in the health sector in terms of structures, governance, accountability, planning, monitoring and evaluation. Fundamental reform of the existing statutory provisions on the roles, organisation structure and management of the health system will be required to give effect to the proposals contained in the reform programme.</P>
        <P>The Government's legislation programme makes provision for the enactment of legislation to give statutory effect where required to implement the proposals in the reform programme. The first element of the programme is the preparation of an establishment order under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, as amended, establishing the interim health services executive on a statutory basis. The order is being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to sign it shortly. This will empower the interim executive to carry out the set up tasks and preparations necessary to enable an orderly transfer of functions to the health service executive when permanently established by new legislation in January 2005.</P>
        <P>It will be necessary to introduce new legislation to provide the main legislative basis for the implementation of the health sector reform programme. It will establish the new health service executive to replace the Eastern Regional <Col N="226"/>Health Authority and the health boards. It will also provide the legislative basis for other aspects of the reform programme such as improved governance and accountability, planning and monitoring and evaluation. The establishment of the health information and quality authority on a legislative basis will also be provided for. It is also my intention that the new legislation will include provision for a statutory framework for complaints procedures in the health services as proposed in the health strategy. My intention is to have this legislation introduced by December 2004 so as to have the health services executive in place in January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government has also indicated its intention in the legislative programme for the spring session to introduce a Health (Amendment) Bill to cope with the situation which will arise following the local elections in June 2004. Given the impending establishment of and formal transfer of functions to the health service executive, the Government has considered whether it would be appropriate to proceed in the normal way with the appointment of local representatives to the health boards after the local elections. I intend discussing the matter further with the Association of Health Boards at a meeting to be arranged in the near future. Following that meeting, I will make a public announcement on the Government's intentions in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I ask about the Health (Amendment) Act which will do away with councillors and professionals from health boards? It causes me a great deal of concern that we are doing away with accountability in the service and not replacing it with any other form of accountability. The Minister said he would set up user groups and so on under the new legislation. That is a long way off. I do not think user groups will provide accountability. Who will run the health service between the time the professionals and councillors are taken away from the health boards and the health executive will be set up in 2005? Who will be accountable and who will ask the difficult questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will be an enabling measure to be given effect by the Minister in terms of dates and so on. There is a real issue around the immediate aftermath of the local elections where one is looking at a six month window between this and the establishment of the HSE. It is a time when members are appointed to a whole range of different bodies.</P>
        <P>I have been on councils and there was a genuine issue to be met. When we met the Association of Health Boards in Ireland before Christmas, we said we would revert back to it in terms of alternative proposals to facilitate the <Col N="227"/>articulation by public representatives in a given region of their views on the health service. I intend to meet the Association of Health Boards in Ireland shortly to discuss this issue further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Minister is embarking on a major health programme such as the one under discussion, does he not accept that his failure to sort out his own smoking ban does not really inspire confidence? Furthermore, does he not accept that confidence is further eroded by the fact that he is abolishing a very important democratic input by local councillors into the health service and its management without having the faintest idea how he will ensure there is some democratic input in the future? Will he not acknowledge that user groups, regardless of their benefits, have no mandate or authority to speak on behalf of others and that the only people on health boards who have such a mandate are those who are democratically elected?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister publish the terms of reference for the interim Health Services Executive? How will he ensure that the democratic deficit he is now introducing at local level will not be introduced at national level in terms of accountability to this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister answering questions regarding the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. As we said, the CEO and board of the HSE will be accountable to the Minister for Health and Children, who will be accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in respect of its duties.</P>

        <P>Although many Members of this House urged for a long time that these reforms be made, I always predicted that, once they were announced, there would be 180&deg; turns on the part of some, who would say, &ldquo;Do not do this and do not do it now.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The Deputy has raised a legitimate issue in terms of the dividing line. In the context of the new health Act, a decision should be made in terms of the areas in which the Health Services Executive would be competent to reply and the areas in which the Minister would be competent to reply. Ideally, the Minister should be concerned with policy and strategic issues. The delivery of services is a matter for the executive body.

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On 10 December, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said outside the House that he had incontrovertible evidence that senior IRA personnel were involved in organised crime in funding Sinn F&eacute;in. On 16 December, the Taoiseach, in response to a question from me in the House, said he considered Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA to be two sides of the one coin. Last week, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform elaborated on his claim and said the wall between Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA was like a Chinese wall indivisible and that money available to one organisation was available to another.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, given the gravity of the claims made by him and that he repeated specifically that he was speaking as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the information and intelligence made available to him? Has the Taoiseach called him in and examined the evidence available to him, which leaves him in no doubt that funding is <Col N="231"/>being made available, through senior IRA personnel involved in organised crime, to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party? If so, what does he propose to do about it in his capacity as Taoiseach and as head of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt with this matter just before the Christmas break and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made a number of statements both inside and outside the House on it. I believe he has also answered some written questions today. He made the point that the collection of evidence regarding any criminal matter is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Obviously, it should be left to the Garda and it is a matter for it to decide what resources to use in the pursuit of criminal matters, be it the Criminal Assets Bureau or other parts of the force.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny correctly stated that in the House before Christmas I dealt with the allegations about the funding of Sinn F&eacute;in. I do not want to comment further on those. I will repeat what I said then and have said when I have been asked by journalists since: if some members of Sinn F&eacute;in want to make charges of corruption against other parties, they should carefully consider from where they are coming on the issue. I have said that outside the House and I say it again here.</P>
      <P>I cannot share with the House the details I receive in confidential briefings from the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on security matters and that has never been done. I have made it clear, however, that I believe that Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA are two sides of the same coin. Deputy Kenny is correct that I have always said that. Where there are suggestions that the IRA or people with connections to it are involved in crime to benefit the IRA, it raises issues for Sinn F&eacute;in, a point I have made several times.</P>
      <P>A central goal of the peace process has been to secure the complete cessation of all involvement in criminal activity by paramilitary groups. All Members of the House should continue to use their influence in that regard. I have made that point in all my meetings and we have passed legislation to establish the Independent Monitoring Commission which will now oversee this area. Everyone must co-operate with that body because it has a vital role to play in moving the situation forward.</P>
      <P>The investigation and prosecution of criminal activity is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions and I do not have a role in that. While there has been no finding in court on this matter, that does not mean investigations will not continue. I do not withdraw the remarks I made in the House in December but I have nothing new to say to Deputy Kenny. The Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="232"/>and Law Reform said what he said. Deputy Kenny asked me if I believe him and I do.</P>

	<P>That is precisely what is wrong with the Government. I did not ask the Taoiseach to share the intelligence information made available to him or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the House. The Taoiseach said he does not have a role in the matter but, as Taoiseach, he has a role in ensuring that the institutions and laws of the State are upheld in the democracy in which we live.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is no fool. He is a Minister of a sovereign Government speaking outside the privilege of the House as Minister and basing his remarks on information supplied to him by intelligence sources. His statement was categorical and it is astonishing that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government and President of the European Union, has not seen fit to uphold his remit based on the direct statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that organised crime and senior IRA personnel are involved in funding Sinn F&eacute;in. If an allegation of such gravity were made about Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or the Green Party, there would be calls for public inquiries and for the forces of the State to see that such matters were investigated, exposed and dealt with by the law.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has no truck with illegal armies, punishment beatings or organised crime. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated his case categorically and the population of the country and I expect the Taoiseach to act on our behalf to uphold the rule of law, the institutions of the State and the democracy in which we all carry out our duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want Deputy Kenny to misquote or misinterpret me. I have stated that there are no direct criminal prosecutions and that the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity are ongoing. I have already answered the question. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also said that there are investigations, but they are matters for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the DPP. I am not saying that we are not concerned about these issues, I am saying that there are ongoing investigations in a number of areas but no prosecutions and I have no role in those investigations or prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Obviously, whether it is in Northern Ireland or the Republic or Ireland, we will do all we can to pursue the ending of any activity of the nature referred to, including punishment beatings. Deputy Kenny was right when he said there have been a number of punishment beatings lately. These are all issues I will continue to address but, while security briefings are given to me and I exchange information on security briefings in my <Col N="233"/>discussions with the British Prime Minister, they are not matters I can put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Leaving aside killing and maiming people, does the Taoiseach agree that the second greatest injustice in the past three decades in this society has been the extent to which the same people have been expected to pay for the running of the State while many of the wealthier elements have engaged in tax evasion and underpayment to the extent that the Committee of Public Accounts heard from the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners before Christmas that &euro;922 million has been recouped as a result of investigations into non-payment of DIRT, Ansbacher, National Irish Bank and other areas?</P>
      <P>In that context, will the Taoiseach examine the conflict in Manchester United? People interested in soccer are fascinated to see the club apparently intent on destroying itself by causing the dismissal of its most successful manager. This is not a dispute about football, transfers or dodgy dealing but about a horse and tax-exempt stallion fees. What could put this into sharper focus than the controversy in the most famous football club in the world that is prepared to tear itself apart over the fees from a single stallion?</P>
      <P>What must the income from the entire industry be worth? We do not know because the Minister for Finance will not address this ongoing injustice. An additional 1,000 hospital beds could be provided by spending &euro;100 million. With what the Taoiseach can see happening at Manchester United, will he ask the Minister for Finance to address this ongoing injustice once and for all in the Finance Bill that is due before the House shortly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that all taxes should be legally paid and, where there are exemptions, the case should be made for them and their value to the economy. That is what happens with all remaining exemptions. The exemption in this case has existed since 1969 and has not changed much since. It was amended in 1997 and a number of groups have analysed it in the period since then.</P>
      <P>There was an anomaly that those who owned stallions were exempt from income tax on the profits or gains arising but did not have to produce accounts. That point was made in the House on a number of occasions. The Finance Act 2003 made it a requirement that accounts would have to be provided for all income earned from stallions. The Minister for Finance stated that the Department of Finance or Revenue Commissioners would examine the information those accounts provided to see if change was necessary.</P><Col N="234"/>
      <P>It was a fair point that, until that change and even though the exemption had been on the Statute Book since 1969, with an amendment in 1997, stallion owners were not required to submit accounts. They argued that they were not making huge profits but provided no evidence. That is a fair point, but it has been corrected. The reason for it is that we can see there is a significant amount of employment in this country due to the fact that the stallions are here. If there was no incentive the stallions would be elsewhere and so would the employment related to the industry. I do not know where Rock of Gibraltar would have ended up, whether in Ireland, Gibraltar, the Middle East or somewhere else. That is another issue. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in that I hope this issue is resolved. I do not want to see it affect a club that has flown the tricolour over its grounds for many decades and is, by connection, an Irish-supported club. I hope those matters are resolved, but I do not think they will be resolved around changes in section 231 of the Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the history and the country has changed a great deal since 1969. I know that the Revenue Commissioners cannot tell us how much tax has been foregone. I know that when the industry was prepared to pay a tax tailored to its particular requirements, the Minister for Finance would not go along with it and that we dragged the commitment from him that in future they will have to make returns only from 1 January this year. They will not have to pay tax. The stable lads will have to pay tax but the owners will not. However, they will have to declare their earned incomes. That is a grave injustice. I know the history of it. I also know that the Taoiseach pulled a great stroke for the owners when he allowed them to have tax exile status and spend more years here. While the Taoiseach worries about Rock of Gibraltar going abroad, it would only be following its owners. They have already gone abroad. They do not pay any tax here.</P>
      <P>If stable lads are expected to pay tax, how is it that people who have tens if not hundreds of millions &mdash; the earnings of Rock of Gibraltar alone are reckoned to be &euro;5 million per annum &mdash; do not pay tax? How can it be justified that the Taoiseach will not require the Minister for Finance to address this ongoing injustice in the tax code? I know the Taoiseach knows the parties on both sides, including Sir Alex Ferguson. I think he togged out a few times for Manchester United when he was at the London School of Economics, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether he is going to change the Finance Act.</P>

	<P>A few Members of the House played at Manchester United's ground last year, if I recall correctly. Unfortunately I was not privileged to be one of them. I would make a few points in reply to Deputy Rabbitte. I am not too sure whether the individuals involved in this case would be beneficiaries to the extent that he thinks. I may be out of date with my information, but I am not too sure that the stud that is well-known is one of the beneficiaries in terms of our tax law. Perhaps my information is out of date as regards the situation as it existed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they will not, but the structure of the studs is well known in the Department of Finance. The bloodstock breeding industry in this country has grown substantially over the last number of years. It is a world-renowned industry. Whether it requires changes or not, it would be interesting now to see an analysis of the accounts. I agree with that, but the export of horses and sales and nominations to foreigners from this country is an enormous business. The latest figures calculated for the entire industry showed that that aspect of its activity employed between 4,500 and 5,000 people. I am totally in favour of the analysis being done based on the accounts now being put forward. However, I would not like to see an amendment being brought in that removes the stallions from this country and the jobs, without proper analysis. The analysis will take place. We will wait and see whether section 231 of the Finance Act needs to be changed but I would prefer that an analysis should be done first based on the accounts.</P>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has made a decision today to build a national stadium at Lansdowne Road and will he clarify that decision? Has the Taoiseach been cured of the Ceaucescu syndrome which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, implied he suffered from, referring to his campaign to build a massive and unviable complex at Abbotstown that would have paralysed the whole of west Dublin on numerous occasions throughout the year if it went ahead? What will the net cost be to the taxpayer of this proposal? How much precisely will be contributed by other associations or individuals &mdash; and who are they &mdash; and the taxpayer? Does <Col N="236"/>the Taoiseach now admit that a huge waste of taxpayers' money has ensued from his pushing ahead in the bull-headed fashion he did, against all good advice for the most part, with the proposed project at Abbotstown? Will he put a figure on how much taxpayers' money has been wasted in that regard to date? Are there outstanding contracts with companies with regard to that project and what have they cost so far? What is the Taoiseach's current thinking on the future for the Abbotstown lands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, has already made a statement today. The new Lansdowne stadium will be a 50,000 all-seat facility. A transparent roof covering the seats will be built on the axis of the existing Lansdowne stadium. The development will commence as soon as possible. If all goes according to schedule it should be completed by 2008. That is the period within which the Government would like to see it built. It will meet all the current international standards for rugby and soccer. The pitch area will of a sufficient size to accommodate Gaelic games. The standard of the facilities will be broadly equivalent to those at Croke Park. It will include corporate boxes and 8,000 premium seats. The estimated cost of the project is about &euro;250 million at current prices which is likely to translate into actual outlays totalling just under &euro;300 million as the project is realised over a period of five years. Approved Government support is &euro;167 million at current prices which is expected to translate into cumulative outlays of &euro;190 million over a five-year period. The major national governing bodies are involved in the project, so hopefully they can get ahead as quickly as possible, because this is vitally important both for rugby and soccer international matches in the future.</P>
      <P>As regards Abbotstown, both the company and the site will remain in the hands of the Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, which will continue to develop other sporting facilities on the site. The only facility built on the site is the aquatic centre which will continue to be a good amenity for the people, international swimmers and those from various parts of the country, but mainly the Deputy's own constituents. He did not want them to have that development, but thankfully they will. Hopefully they will have other sporting facilities as well in spite of the Deputy. The issues of its further development will have to be in line with private sector involvement on the site and whatever grants they get from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. That is what the land will be used for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to take the sting out of what the Taoiseach just threw in there. I was an enthusiastic supporter of the water sports project. As a member of Fingal County Council, I was instrumental, with others, in ensuring it received every co-operation as a sensible facility for people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question on how much money was needlessly spent on the proposed Abbotstown project. Perhaps he will reply in that regard. What budget has been set aside for Abbotstown? What is the nature of the project on which the Taoiseach stated Campus Stadium Ireland will work? The Taoiseach was prepared to find approximately &euro;750 million to fund his proposal. Many of us made the point at that time that such funding would be better spent on improving the inferior facilities of working class communities and on a sensibly proposed stadium. Will the Taoiseach ensure that that is what will happen? As the T&aacute;naiste has allegedly won that argument, should we be fearful that her proposal to throw elderly people into the cold will now be pursued with greater vigour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins appears to support the development, I thought he was saying it was a waste of resources. There was no waste of resources. Feasibility studies carried out in that regard will be useful for the further development of the site for sporting requirements in the future.</P>
      <P>The board will have to make its case for ongoing developments. The national governing bodies and groups such as the community games, international soccer groups, training ground managers and other facilities also have proposals which they wish the Department to pursue. All these proposals will have to be assessed in the future. While there were some facilities on the site, they were poor and a new scientific laboratory was required. Therefore, I do not consider that to be a waste of resources.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue, as it has done in recent years, to invest money in youth and sporting facilities. I am sure the Deputy will welcome and support such developments in his area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The passing of Pat Joe Reynolds on 27 December last was a source of much regret within the Fine Gael family. Our sadness was nothing compared to the great loss felt by his wife Tess, their sons Gerry and Peter, their daughters Ita and Regina, their spouses and their families. His brother, Kevin, and sister, Mary, will also <Col N="238"/>miss Pat Joe who was known as a man always devoted to his own.</P>
      <P>One could say the Reynolds family lived the political life of this nation from 1927 when Pat Joe's late father, Paddy, was elected to the Sixth D&aacute;il where he and his contemporaries pursued the arduous, post-Civil War journey towards constitutionalism, begun earlier by Griffith and Collins. A number of political families have done this State some service but, perhaps, none more so than the Reynolds family who, between 1927 and 2002, had 75 years of unbroken service to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe's late father, Paddy, was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1927. Following his death in 1932, his wife, Mary, took over his seat and held it for another 29 years. Pat Joe, in turn, succeeded his mother in 1961. From then until 1987, Pat Joe represented the people of Leitrim and Roscommon with passion and courage, whether in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad. His son, Gerry, was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1987, holding his seat with the characteristic Reynolds honour until 2002.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe Reynolds held a number of key posts in his long and distinguished political career. At local level, he was the longest-serving member of Leitrim County Council, representing his community from 1942 to 1985. His son, Gerry, still represents his people on the council. He was chairman of the council from 1967 to 1979 and was noted for the diligence he applied to that office. At national level, Pat Joe served as Parliamentary Secretary, now known as Minister of State, to the then Ministers for Local Government and Posts and Telegraphs. As Cathaoirleach of the Seanad from 1983 to 1987, he addressed both Houses of the Oireachtas on the visit of President Reagan in 1984. He thanked the President for the work he had done for and on behalf of Ireland, especially in promoting peace on the island.</P>
      <P>Some 20 years on, I know that Pat Joe was happy that peace had been achieved and that the Border counties would benefit from its dividend. For those who never knew or met Pat Joe Reynolds, he was a great man for a story and a joke. He lived for and loved his community, never forgetting his origins or his friends. He had a rootedness with his people who knew they could always rely on him to press their case at the highest levels.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe was a great humanitarian, a man with a deeply seated social conscience which could be seen in his work for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. He was also a man of deep and considerable faith and I know his meeting with Pope John Paul left a lasting impression on him.</P>
      <P>It was as a family man, husband, father and grandfather that Pat Joe truly excelled, where he had most impact and, consequently, where he will be most missed. I know that he watched closely <Col N="239"/>over the political career of his son, Gerry. I think there will be general agreement that an apprenticeship served under Pat Joe was time well spent. I know that Pat Joe instilled in his family the Fine Gael ideal that he took from his father and mother. The democratic ideal that as politicians we are servants of the people, that we are in politics to do their work, to voice their concerns and to make their lives better, is the ideal with which Fine Gael founded this State, the same ideal by which we pursue and live our political lives today.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe Reynolds served his county and his country judiciously and honestly. For now, there is little to be said except to wish Pat Joe, as he wished President Reagan here in this House, God speed. I visited Pat Joe in the nursing home in Ballinamore some months ago. He sat on a chair at the end of the bed and reflected upon the ups and downs of his political career. He said: &ldquo;Times were not easy when I started out and through all the changes in the political sphere, I always tried to do my best and to help those who came to me in any way that I could.&rdquo; That is not a bad political philosophy for any public representative at any time.</P>
      <P>In the next phase of his life, Pat Joe Reynolds might find wisdom in the words of his fellow-countyman, John McGahern:</P>
      <P LI="1">Anything that is given can at once be taken away. We have to learn to expect anything and when it comes it's no more than a gift on loan.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of Pat Joe Reynolds. As Deputy Kenny stated, Pat Joe made an enormous contribution to political life locally, in the Seanad and in this House, serving in all the positions outlined. I know he was particularly proud to have served as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I remember Pat Joe well. He served as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad from 1983 to 1987. I subscribe to everything Deputy Kenny said about Pat Joe Reynolds. He was both a serious politician and a good storyteller who was always able to reflect on his long life in politics. He was a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 26 years and was involved in politics from as far back as 1940 as an activist and member of Leitrim County Council. As Deputy Kenny stated, the late Pat Joe inherited a long and fine tradition in <Col N="240"/>public life. Together with his family, he had been a loyal member of Fine Gael and served his constituents with integrity and commitment throughout his long career in public life. He was also a successful businessman who built up a thriving enterprise in difficult times. The late Pat Joe Reynolds not only inherited this tradition but built upon it through his life's work of service and integrity.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Kenny and Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife Tess and his four children &mdash; Gerry, our former D&aacute;il colleague, Ita, Regina and Peter &mdash; and extend the sympathies of Fianna F&aacute;il to his family.

      <P>I met Pat Joe Reynolds on only two or three occasions but am aware of his dedication to serve his constituents according to his own likes over a period which is almost exceptional in a House in which a number of families have served long periods. The Reynolds family served the House for three generations through the remarkable circumstances in which Pat Joe Reynolds' mother succeeded her husband in the House. It represents a long period of dedicated public service. I reiterate the sympathies of the Labour Party to the Reynolds family and acknowledge Pat Joe Reynolds' contribution to public life.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I echo the warm and sincere tributes which have been paid to Pat Joe Reynolds.</P>
      <P>His 26 years of unstinting service to the State are a great achievement in themselves but when, as other speakers have noted, we recall that three generations of that family represented Leitrim in one or other Houses of the Oireachtas between 1927 and the last general election, we realise the country owes the family a great debt of gratitude for its services to Ireland. It is unique to have both of one's parents serve as Members of the Oireachtas, but that was the legacy into which Pat Joe Reynolds was born.</P>
      <P>His late father, Paddy, was elected in 1927 and, following his death in 1932, in difficult circumstances Pat Joe's mother, Mary, was elected in his place. That great woman held the seat for 29 years and when she retired in 1961, Pat Joe came to represent his party in that part of the country.</P><Col N="241"/>
      <Miles com="fc" />
      <P>Throughout his political career, Pat Joe Reynolds was uncompromising on the issue of violence and terrorism, which was especially courageous and brave since he came from an area close to the Border. He was also a fiercely honourable politician who stood by his principles and was not simply principled but was decent to everyone he met. He was Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann from 1983 to 1987 and people who observed politics from the outside, as I did at that time, knew that he chaired that House with great ease and humour. I re-echo the words of sympathy to his son Gerry, our former colleague who served this House so well, his wife, Tess, his daughters, Regina and Ita, and his son, Peter.

      <P>It is daunting to contemplate the sense of loss the Reynolds family is experiencing. I hope they will feel touched by people's stated appreciation of the family's honourable legacy in serving the people of Leitrim and the north-west.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe served for a long period on Leitrim County Council from 1942 to 1985 at a time when local authorities had perhaps more influence than they do today. There is no doubt that Pat Joe has taken with him to the grave an enormous legacy which his family will keep alive. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

	<P>It is my honour to pay tribute to the late Pat Joe Reynolds. I extend my sympathy to his wife, Tess, son, Peter, daughters, Regina and Ita, in particular my former constituency colleague, Gerard, and extended family.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State, the Reynolds family has made an enormous contribution to the people of Sligo and Leitrim, the Fine Gael Party and the Oireachtas. While Pat Joe's retirement from political life preceded my entry into public life by a decade, I had always regarded him as hard working, kind and straight talking man.</P>
      <P>Among his own people, Pat Joe was regarded as a fountain of knowledge on the public <Col N="242"/>administration system in the days before the Internet, one-stop shops or information booklets. The most exciting period of Pat Joe's political career must have been the 1973 general election which saw his return to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to represent the people of Sligo-Leitrim. This was a key victory in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition to unseat Fianna F&aacute;il after 16 years in power.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Local Government and Posts and Telegraphs of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government. This was a key appointment by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, as Pat Joe had developed a great expertise in local government from decades as a member of Leitrim County Council. Liam Cosgrave's faith was rewarded with great loyalty by Pat Joe who fearlessly defended Fine Gael's opposition to violence throughout the Troubles in a Border county.</P>
      <P>Pat Joe's finest hour was probably his election as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1983. This gave him membership of the Council of State, one of the most prestigious constitutional bodies. This was fitting for one who had such respect for the institutions of State. It is equally important to note that he was elected by party colleagues as a nominee for Cathaoirleach rather than by the party leader as is usually the case.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o'clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In the folklore of the county, Pat Joe will be best remembered as the first Leitrim man to be honoured with a State car during his time as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and for his robust performance as a platform speaker during election rallies. Pat Joe's contribution to business life in his native county must not be forgotten either as he developed an extensive business in Leitrim. Pat Joe was an outstanding public servant.

I always found that, while we disagreed politically, we never had animosity towards one another on a personal level. While he was very much an adversary of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in Leitrim, we very much appreciated that the late Pat Joe Reynolds engaged in fair politics.</P>
      <P>I express to his wife Tess, sons, Peter and Gerard, daughters, Ita and Regina, brother, Kevin, and sister, Mary, my deepest sympathy on their great loss. Pat Joe Reynolds was an institution in Leitrim and in Fine Gael politics. Fine Gael has lost a true stalwart.</P>

He was first elected to the House to represent Roscommon-Leitrim in 1961, served two further terms representing the people of both counties and, subsequently, was elected to the Seanad, where he ultimately served as Cathaoirleach. The Reynolds family has a strong connection with democratic politics and it is remarkable that he and his family gave more than 75 years of unbroken public service in both Houses of the Oireachtas, much of this during turbulent times in the history of the State, as outlined by previous contributors. He gave tremendous service to his constituents and he will be a loss to the people of Leitrim and, more especially, to his devoted family.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
      <P>On behalf of my family and the Fine Gael organisation in County Roscommon, I express my sympathy to his wife Tess, his two sons, Gerry and Peter, and his daughters, Ita and Regina. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I join the House in extending my sympathy to the Reynolds family. The Devins and Reynolds families have a long history. We were on opposite sides of the political divide many times but we were close. On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in County Sligo, I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Tess and his sons and daughters.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Independents and as a Deputy for the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, I would like to be associated with all the tributes that have been paid to the late Pat Joe Reynolds. He represented Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in the House. I did not know him but since his death I have read a great deal in local newspapers about his life and service to the people of Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon. His family can look with pride on his achievements and contribution. We can all recognise that his was a life well lived. I contacted a colleague who knew him well and he described him as straight, honest, hard working and &ldquo;as decent a man as ever came out of Leitrim&rdquo;. I extend my sympathy to his family and friends.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 13, motion re statement of expenditure for the Houses of the Oireachtas; No. 14, ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; and No. 5, Civil Registration Bill 2003 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 13 and 14 should be decided without debate. Private Members' Business shall be No. 35, motion re economic plight of Irish emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for taking Nos. 13 and 14, motions re statement of expenditure for the Houses of the Oireachtas and ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, without debate agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We should have a debate on No. 13. On far too many occasions we hear it said in the media that this House does its business in respect of its own work in some secret fashion. We should be open and above board about what the House does and the expenditure connected with doing that work. In the interest of everybody we should have a debate of some description on this matter so that we do not see the false portrayal of expenditure being passed in secret by the House in respect of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, would like to have seen a debate on this measure and the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, represented that view at the Whips' meeting. The placing of the business of the administration of the Oireachtas in the hands of the Oireachtas for the first time is, potentially, an important reform. If the Taoiseach is not minded to acknowledge that there ought to be a debate now, as soon as the commission is functioning and has some proposals to bring to the House, it is important that we have an early debate on it.</P>
      <P>I did not notice it at the time, although I am sure all Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers did, but I am now aware that a statutory instrument has been passed by the House capping the staffing to political parties. The last time I spoke to the Minister for Finance, he promised us all a geisha girl. He said he did not care if we employed a geisha girl and implied that he was making provision for us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>That was very generous of him.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="247"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister with responsibility for recreation certainly has time on his hands. However, if the statutory instrument has been passed, it is difficult to deal with the requirements of the parties in an innovative way. This is especially true of the Opposition parties who have a definite requirement for research and back-up. I hope the Taoiseach will be able to say that we will have an early debate on the functioning of the commission and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The requests for a debate are supported by the Green Party-Comhaontas Glas, especially as it galls us not even to be represented on the commission. The commission includes members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats but there is no representative from the Technical Group. That in itself indicates a need for a debate, which would be the only opportunity members of my party, of other smaller parties and Independent Members would have to contribute their views on this matter. A more inclusive decision-making and accountability process is required.</P>
      <P>Deputies from smaller parties must work without desks of their own and without the facilities which are taken for granted in larger parties. They use desks that are intended for interns. It is important that there be a debate and that there be changes to make this a more inclusive decision-making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bad start to the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission that it is proposed to proceed with a proposal relating to it without debating it. I join my colleagues in highlighting a number of deficiencies in this matter. These relate not only to the proposition and the breakdown of the financial allocation for 2004, as circularised to us. Deputies wish to ask questions as well as offer opinions about the business of the commission and other aspects that it will, I hope, address in the course of the coming months.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Sargent, I emphasise that Sinn F&eacute;in does not have access to the commission. This is something I have recorded previously. The same applies to the Socialist Party and to the Independent Deputies. A significant number of Members of the House have no direct input into the work of the commission and no provision was made for them. It is imperative that a proper debate is facilitated. The opportunity for Members, not only to offer opinion but also to seek information, would be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a full and good debate on the establishment of the commission when the legislation was passed by the House. As Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and others have said, there has been a change in structure. The commission <Col N="248"/>was established on 1 January. I propose that the House has a debate during this session when the commission has been in operation for some time. We should allow the commission to get up and running and we can then have a debate on a date to be agreed.</P>
      <P el="10">Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13 and 14 be agreed&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Six of the Bills on the legislative programme for the spring session of 2004 were published on the previous A list. Do the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip have a clearer strategy for dealing with the proposals in this nine or ten week session? Are we likely to be able to complete the programme as outlined?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we should have a debate with questions and answers on the Nally report which deals with the aftermath of the Omagh bomb? This report was given to the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the end of the summer and was the subject of brief statements in the House before Christmas. There should be a more expansive debate at an appropriate time which would be within certain constraints and would include a question and answer session. Does the Taoiseach agree that such a debate should be part of the programme in the coming weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative programme includes the Bills with which Departments and Ministers hope to deal during this session. The programme usually changes during a session. Sometimes Bills that are on the list are not ready, for different reasons, while other Bills come forward which were not expected. Subject to such changes, it is intended that the legislation listed will be brought forward during this session.</P>
      <P>We had short statements on the Nally report before Christmas and we said we would examine the matter again. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask if it can be debated again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question about the status of Bills. Regarding heritage, I take a keen interest in the published programme for the forthcoming session. I have been watching the progress of particular heritage legislation that in October 2002 was promised for early 2003 and in January 2003 was promised for late 2003. By May 2003 it was still promised for late 2003 so my hopes were raised, but by September 2003 I was promised a heritage Bill in early 2004. It is now early 2004 and the national monuments Bill is being promised for mid-2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You have made your point Deputy. You will have to find another way to raise the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been more or less six months away for the past two and a half years. Can we believe anything about the status of Bills given the fictitious nature of the promised dates in this example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>The disability Bill was to have been published in January. Can the Taoiseach give an exact date as to when this will be published? Are the heads of the Bill being discussed with various disability groups at the moment? If so why are they not being made available to Opposition spokespersons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been requested many times by people within the House and outside to have ongoing discussion with the organisations, particularly the Disability Legislative Consultation Group, the combined group, and that has been ongoing. There were meetings. It is not a question that they were given the legislation, but there were discussions about the issues involved and the heads. They required further time to come back with their comments. As soon as that happens, the Bill should be ready. The Government is ready to finally bring the Bill to Cabinet. As we did with the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, we promised we would engage in discussion with the group, which needs some time to come back to us.</P>

As usual the Minister introduces a new Bill very quickly and wants it guillotined.

      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds. Migratory waterfowl, most notably wild duck, are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses and these birds are also most resistant to infection. Domestic poultry, including chickens and turkeys, are particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been confirmed in poultry in south-east Asia and the only country approved for export of poultry meat and poultry meat products to the EU in this region is Thailand.</P>
        <P>Avian influenza viruses rarely affect humans and do not normally infect species other than birds. The virus has on occasion, however, been isolated in humans, and in Vietnam the H5N1 virus has been isolated from a small number of patients who have died. There is, however, no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans other than by direct contact with infected birds. The risk from poultry meat to humans is negligible as the virus is destroyed during meat maturation, by cooking and by stomach acids.</P>
        <P>Within the EU, the response to the outbreak in Thailand is being co-ordinated and operated by the EU Commission. In line with its responsibility, the Commission has taken a safeguard decision, No. 2004/84/EC, which prohibits the import of fresh meat of poultry, ratites, wild and farmed feathered game; meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of these species; raw material for pet food production; and eggs for human consumption. The decision does not apply to meat obtained from birds slaughtered before 1 January 2004 and poultry meat products that have been heat-treated.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Commission decisions apply to all EU member states. We have announced a ban on the direct import into Ireland of poultry meat and products, in line with the EU Commission decision, with effect from 24 January 2004. This is being implemented by the veterinary inspection services of the Department at the border inspection posts, in Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. Since 1 January 2004, there have been three imports of Thai poultry meat directly into Ireland and all this product was, according to the veterinary certificates submitted under third country import requirements, produced in the period October to November 2003. In view of the fact that all poultry meat <Col N="257"/>imported from Thailand is frozen and takes at least two weeks to reach Europe, it is unlikely that there is any poultry meat from Thailand in Irish retail or catering premises which has been produced from poultry slaughtered since 1 January 2004.</P>
        <P>With regard to poultry meat products in the shops, we are guided in our approach by the scientific opinions available from the European Commission services, including the European Food Safety Agency, the World Health Organisation, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and our departmental veterinary services. The risk to public health from poultry meat is small and the risk of persons catching influenza from cooked poultry meat is zero. In line with this scientific advice, having poultry meat withdrawn from sale in the current situation is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>The Department has in place an ongoing monitoring programme for avian influenza in poultry. During 2002-03, a more extensive survey of poultry and wild birds was carried out as part of an EU survey. The results showed no evidence of H5 or H7 subtypes. These subtypes are of most importance in poultry as they are the subtypes that cause highly pathogenic avian influenza and are the only subtypes that have been associated with deaths in humans.</P>
        <P>The introduction of avian influenza to the Irish poultry flock is a constant threat, which primarily exists from wild birds, particularly from migratory waterfowl. The risk of introduction via imported poultry meat is negligible in this country as it is highly unlikely that uncooked poultry meat will be eaten by poultry. The epidemic of influenza that is currently occurring in Asia is a timely reminder of the risks posed by wild birds. Our Department is currently contacting all poultry farmers to remind them of the precautions they can take to help keep out avian diseases. I wish to emphasise that our Department has a contingency plan in place to deal with any outbreak or suspected outbreak of avian influenza in our poultry flock.</P>
        <P>Controls operated on imports ensure that meat imports come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. In addition, meat may only be sourced from establishments in those countries which are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. The Food and Veterinary Office of the European Union carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal 
diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected <Col N="258"/>regions of the country or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>At the EU border inspection post all consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purposes of safeguarding human and animal health is carried out. Once imported meat has met all the required conditions, it is released for free circulation within the Union. Copies of the border inspection post clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has acted quickly and appropriately in line with the threat posed by the outbreak in Thailand. We in Ireland have acted promptly in line with the EU Commission decision in the interests of human and poultry health in Ireland. The situation in south-east Asia is being kept under review by the Commission and by the veterinary services of our Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although I have a number of questions arising from it. It is clear that this influenza was rampant in Thailand long before it was officially notified. I appreciate that the Minister of State cannot take responsibility for that. However, it must be acknowledged and action must be taken on foot of that information. It is clear that during November it was basically hidden in Thailand. That is significant in terms of the dates and times after which the meat was banned in this country.</P>
        <P>The FVO is the EU agency with responsibility for monitoring in third countries. It is located in County Meath. I understand the last time it visited Thailand was in 2001. From what I saw on its website, it visited only three slaughter houses. Is the Minister of State entirely satisfied with the frequency, extent and outcome of those visits? Is he aware of any spot-checks? Are visits pre-arranged? What representations, if any, have been made to the Food and Veterinary Office following this current outbreak?</P>
        <P>There are serious concerns about labelling. I went to the supermarket last Saturday to buy some chicken. I did not have any way of knowing where that poultry came from as it was not labelled. It could have been from the planet Mars for all I knew. I am aware that there was no hazard associated with it once I had cooked it. There is an issue of consumer confidence and genuine consumer concern which has not been addressed. It is crucial that imported products are labelled with the country of origin. That has been highlighted during this current outbreak.</P>
        <P>Is there any information about the process in this country for sourcing poultry from Thailand? I understand a certain amount of it comes in <Col N="259"/>through the EU, but there are importers here through whom it comes in directly. What checks, if any, are imposed on such importers and what standards apply to them? Are they answerable for the quality and safety of the products they import?</P>
        <P>It is clear that this is more an economic risk than a health risk at present. However, there are health issues which must be addressed for the future, particularly in terms of any risk which might relate to the transmission of avian influenza and its convergence with human influenza. The ultimate consequences of that have been highlighted by a number of publications, including the World Health Organisation. It is clear the consequences of that would imply a pandemic of influenza which would be difficult to control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for those interesting questions. I do not have all the information for the questions she asked. As regards the possibility that this problem may have been rampant in Thailand before November or before it was notified, the European Commission has constantly monitored and assessed the situation. From the information available to it, we are satisfied that we are in control of the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> imports to this country.</P>
        <P>Today the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, addressed the environment and agricultural committees of the European Parliament where this issue was discussed. It was concluded at those meetings that the situation was an animal health issue, as distinct from a human health issue. It is a great consolation that there is international agreement on that. The European Commission is committed to stringent standards. We have an ongoing monitoring programme in place, which was assessed by the European Commission last autumn. It concluded in a recent report that our standards were among the highest in Europe and it was satisfied with our operations.</P>
        <P>As regards the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Union and its visits to Thailand, I do not have information on that, but I will seek it out immediately. When I get that information, I will give it to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As regards labelling, the Department addressed that issue in recent years through the food division. We established a national body to assess the situation. Questions were asked about whether it was appropriate to label every product and about the type of labelling which should be done. That matter is currently under review as we work to get agreement between producers, distributors and other commercial operations to ensure that we do not create any impediment which would deflect from the capacity of Irish <Col N="260"/>food products to penetrate European and global markets. That is of great importance to our economy. We want products to be labelled so that the consumer can identify where a product is produced. We hope to achieve that in a balanced way. We hope to find a resolution sooner rather than later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Thailand exports approximately $336 million of poultry to the EU. Some 1,200 tonnes of chicken are exported to this country, mainly in the form of fillets. Deputy Upton said that people do not know from where certain products come. We do not know from where chicken fillets come. Does the Minister of State agree that is a serious issue? He said in his initial reply, &ldquo;the European Commission has acted quickly and appropriately in line with the threat posed by the outbreak in Thailand.&rdquo; That is completely baseless because allegations have been made in Thailand since last November about the presence of bird influenza. Traders, farmers, veterinarians and consumer groups have sought to raise the issue with the Government in Thailand in recent weeks. It appears that there has been a cover-up in Thailand to protect the vested interests rather than the consumers.</P>
        <P>On Monday week last Commissioner Byrne stated in Bangkok that there was no evidence of the existence of bird influenza in Thailand. He was misled by the Thai Government, and the food and veterinary office was not doing its job. Will the Minister of State, with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, try to rein in the food and veterinary office? I have seen inspection reports it has produced on beef in Brazil and Argentina that have identified problems, yet nothing seems to happen.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is said that this flu does not affect humans if the meat undergoes a certain process but it is possible that chicken produced since November was infected. Is it possible that we could be importing some of that product and that it is on sale here, having come in from other EU countries? The Minister of State says that the possibility of it coming directly from Thailand is not an issue. We may, however, be taking it from other EU countries. In mid-2002 banned carcinogenic substances were found in poultry from Thailand. Prior to that approximately 20% of product was checked but following that discovery 100% was checked. Will the Minister of State say whether that check is still in place or has it been reduced? If the Minister of State cannot answer the question now he can give me the answer later.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
        <P>Does he agree that this shows once again the complete lack of information given to consumers regarding products?</P>
        <P>We do not know where or how a product is produced. It appears on this occasion that the food and veterinary office, despite the Minister <Col N="261"/>of State's comments, acted quickly and appropriately. We are three months behind. The Japanese banned the import of this product, and in a pre-emptive strike, Thailand banned its export, perhaps even before the EU banned the import which it did as a reaction to the Thai export ban.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year we imported 966 tonnes of poultry product from Thailand. In 2002 we imported approximately 1,200 tonnes. The present system and the food and veterinary office and Commission operations in the European Union ensure constant monitoring in all the countries exporting product to the European Union. If product were coming in here through EU countries rather than directly the checks would operate. We have a very rigid system of veterinary inspectors, agriculture officers and Customs and Excise officers checking at the ports. Certificates must be shown and they carry the product to its destination. There is no need for anyone to be scared. We are satisfied there is no product here from Thailand produced since November. We have quality product, we are in a global market and within the European Union where extra checks and balances operate.</P>
        <P>I will raise the issue mentioned by Deputy Timmins with the food and veterinary office to ensure regular checking and implementation of the regulations and criteria to provide an absolute guarantee for the quality of the product coming into the European Union. Our colleagues at the WTO are sure to raise this at the next round of discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned the Minister of State does not agree that the virus potentially represents a grave danger to the health of the public and the future of the poultry industry. It represents a threat to both. Surely all chicken products without country of origin labels should be immediately removed from our market. That is the very least that should be done in this situation. I am not convinced by the EU directive on Thai imports. Maybe Deputy Upton can offer a professional opinion in this regard but frozen birds mean frozen virus, not dead virus. That is a very important point. The freezing of chicken meat does not kill a virus in the bird, it merely freezes it. The danger exists that the virus can be reactivated in the thaw-out process. Thailand is only one of eight Asian countries in which this avian flu outbreak has been recorded. There have been seven recorded deaths, six in Vietnam and one, of a six year old boy, in Thailand. This is a very serious matter.</P>
        <P>There is one sentence in the text distributed by the Minister of State which he did not read into the record. Perhaps he overlooked it in the course of his address or skipped over it by mistake and <Col N="262"/>I wish to highlight it. The record will show that I am absolutely accurate in the point I make. It states: &ldquo;There are no imports of poultry meat from Thailand recorded, which have been produced in that country after November 2003.&rdquo; Maybe there is no significance in the Minister of State's omission and if so I am prepared to accept his assurance. I watched carefully and followed the course of his delivery and the text presented. Will the Minister of State clarify this point?</P>
        <P>The word &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; in that sentence is very important. How can we be sure that poultry imported from Thailand or any of the other affected countries has not reached, or is not reaching, our shores? The poultry industry is critically important to my constituency which has recently lost one of the most significant outlets for local producers. I am concerned that there is ongoing importation of poultry meat, some of which is recorded and perhaps some of which is not. My interest is twofold, for the health care concerns of the public I represent and the producers whose livelihoods depend on a first class product, made under the stringent controls imposed by the Minister of State, his Department and the Government, which I commend. People are concerned that the situation is not as tight as it should be, and that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>What is the position of chicken products from Thailand which remain in the European Union after the import ban has been imposed? Is it not time for compulsory country of origin labelling to be required at national and EU levels? Will the Government press for that during the EU Presidency? Surely our Presidency of the European Union is a golden opportunity for the Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his colleagues in the Department, to ensure that best practice is employed not only here but across the European Union. If there is laxity and an opportunity for irregular activity to take place in this very important sector, it will continue after enlargement of the Union when undoubtedly the stringency required at least for an interim period, will be absent. This is imperative for our health and for the future of this industry.</P>
        <P>Traceability is extremely important to the consumer, the producer and those who are employed in poultry processing units. The livelihoods of the workers in these factories also depends on best practice and an above the board operation in every aspect of poultry production and its onward sale to the consumer.</P>
        <P>There is the further concern not directly related to the avian flu virus but of great concern to the poultry sector, particularly in the constituency I represent, that is, the importation of poultry litter to the compost manufacturing yards in my constituency and other locations in this jurisdiction. What measures are being <Col N="263"/>considered by the Department to ensure that these poultry litter importers operate under the waste management guidelines set down in the various regional documents? Have they got licences for the transfer of such waste material? Are the necessary checks in place regarding what the poultry litter may contain or entail in the manufacturing of compost?</P>
        <P>This practice which has recently developed in cross-Border traffic represents a threat to poultry producers in County Monaghan and the neighbouring counties because they cannot now dispose of the waste produced at their units. I raised this important matter at local authority level yesterday and now with the Minister of State. I ask for his direct attention and intervention to protect the poultry production sector in the constituency I represent and throughout the jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I was a member of a health board from 1999 to last November, when I had to stand aside as a result of the ending of the dual mandate. I raised at health board level the issue of the sourcing of poultry products. I am of the view, which I believe is shared by many people, that in the catering sector and in areas under the control and influence of Government, either directly or through the various arms of local government, in this instance health boards, poultry products are used which are not sourced at home. There is a question of traceability. If we are to see best practice and confidence in this sector, we must ensure that the catering industry recognises its responsibility to consumers and that health boards publicly guarantee that poultry used in hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities under their control and aegis is sourced at home under Irish controls and restrictions so that the public can have full confidence in the product it consumes.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take seriously the points expressed. Nobody is trying to put him in a difficult position. We appeal to him, considering the position he holds with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to recognise the seriousness of the issue. I urge a reconsideration of some of the points of assurance the Minister of State gave us in his address as they fall short of the assurances I need as a public representative and a consumer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we put a euro on it?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="264"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>We will put ten euro on it if the Deputy wishes. I repeat that there is no record of imports of poultry meat from Thailand which was produced in that country after November 2003. I thought I made that clear. I also made clear that from the information available to us and from the market situation, none of these products is currently on sale in Irish retail outlets. I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that this is an important issue, but we must consider it in terms of its importance in that Thailand is one country in south-east Asia accredited to export poultry products into the European Union. Some 966 tonnes of poultry products from Thailand came into Ireland last year. We have checks and balances of the European Commission and the rules and regulations laid down by the food and veterinary office of the Commission for products coming into the EU. We have the very strict regime operated in this country for food imports, a regime marshalled and operated by Department of Agriculture and Food staff, veterinary inspectors and agricultural officers, supported by Customs and Excise staff. There is a very strong chain of checks and balances to protect the product coming into the country.</P>
        <P>Chicken products in other member states of the European Union are a matter for the European Commission and for each member state to decide what it wishes to do regarding those products. If the Commission gives a directive or an indication that certain actions should be taken in the interests of the poultry industry across Europe, we would be the first to respond &mdash; there is no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Government are committed to traceability. We have proven that with the decisions we have taken on all aspects of food in recent years, particularly since 1997. We have been constantly abused and harangued for our insistence that we should have traceability for all products. We can never get political, or indeed public, consensus that traceability is critical in the interests of the quality of products, the health of consumers and, above all, assurance for the discerning consumer in knowing exactly the origin and quality of the product.</P>
        <P>I am surprised Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has a problem with cross-Border traffic. Trade across the island of Ireland is critically important for its future. I am fully aware of the situation referred to by the Deputy. I established a national mushroom task force in early December to look at the mushroom industry, including the composting industry. The task force is looking at the quality of the compost and its component parts and will report to me later this year. We are taking a critical look at the interim mushroom industry, including composting and poultry litter. We are aware of the product coming from Northern Ireland and of the trends and the <Col N="265"/>business and commercial operations building up in Northern Ireland with the Republic. We hope that will continue into the future and a cross-Border trade will develop with a strong regulatory regime. We want development to continue in the area, subject to sustainable and transparent standards in the interests of economic growth and quality product.</P>
        <P>The poultry produced in this country and imported into it presents no threat to human or animal health. The system we have in place gives absolute assurance to all our consumers. The final assurance I give as a Member of this House is that when I have my tea this evening I will certainly order chicken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputies that we are dealing with a parliamentary question and statements are not in order although supplementary questions may be asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>After some lengthy statements, I am a little disturbed that anything other than questions might be allowed. I am very conscious of this issue and more worried now than before the comments made by the Minister of State. I represent a constituency largely dependent on the poultry industry. Two thirds of all the poultry produced in Ireland are produced in that area so it is a major issue for us.</P>
        <P>Although I know he cannot tell us today, will the Minister of State tell us what veterinary controls there are on the importation of product into Ireland? It is frightening to hear that there may have been no veterinary visits to Thailand since 2001. I ask the Minister of State to compare that situation with the slaughter of meat in this country for Israel or any other country, whereby personnel from those countries oversee such slaughter to make sure they get exactly what they want and pay for.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue with the Taoiseach following a visit to the USA by members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. Why must our farmers be so precise in regard to production, including at factory level, while other products can be imported from Brazil, Thailand and so on, on the say so of someone else? I urge the Minister of State to look again at the situation and to ensure that products imported into this country are produced to the same high standards, systems and controls as is the case here, not just from the farmers' point of view but also from the point of view of consumers.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State assure me that products imported from other European countries do not come originally from third countries and, therefore, are not labelled? It is vital that we are aware of where products originated. The Minister of State referred to <Col N="266"/>mushrooms. Our mushroom market in the UK is being undercut. Some of these mushrooms may be Polish mushrooms which are being sold as Irish produce. We need to be very careful about this area. The problem is not just human health, which is extremely important and the first priority, but we must think about the future of those who built up an industry and were proud to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disingenuous of Deputy Crawford, a man who has huge knowledge of the livestock industry in particular, to say that we do not have sufficient veterinary controls. All product imported into the European Union must have veterinary certification. The documentation is checked when the product arrives in the European Union. Veterinary inspectors, agriculture officers and various other public officials here carry out strict checks. The checks and balances are in place, not just in this country but in the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the country of origin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards product in the European Union, there are different views. There is no consensus within Europe <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> labelling and the country of origin. Many countries want a label on the product stating, &ldquo;Manufactured in the EU&rdquo;. That is currently the overriding view. Other countries would like the country of origin to be indicated on the product. We hope during our Presidency to make progress in this regard. The Irish Presidency has put the issue forward as one of its priorities. We will do our utmost to make progress in that area.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to the mushroom industry. I have had a strong interest in that industry since taking up office. Prior to that I was not very aware of the situation in the mushroom industry. I visited the United Kingdom to promote Irish mushrooms and saw at first hand the competition from other countries. I suggest that all mushroom products coming into the UK originate in Poland, Germany and Holland. The only requirement from the major multiples who sell these products in the United Kingdom &mdash; the same applies to Ireland &mdash; is that we give them quality mushrooms which they can sell to British consumers. They do not mind where they originate once they are a quality product. We travel to the UK to promote Ireland, Irish mushrooms and Irish food products. We have a very strong market in the UK and throughout Europe. We export 80% to 90% of all our food products. If we did not meet high standards and have a good track record, we could not continue to sustain our food exports with such success. <Col N="267"/>There was a 10% volume growth in our food exports last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In mushrooms?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Overall there was a 10% volume growth. The mushroom industry is very competitive. It is currently going through a critical period. We have established a national task force. There are excellent people on the task force, many of whom come from the Deputy's area. I await the report and we will respond to it as generously as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a couple of important issues which must be looked at. It is clear that the virus can remain viable for long periods in faecal material, for example. As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, it can remain viable indefinitely in the frozen state. In other words, it can recover its viability. It does not die. There are consequences to each of these issues. Is there concern in regard to visitors to Thailand returning to this country or is there a need to put in place measures at airports in regard to people returning from Thailand? I accept the risk is remote but there is a need for awareness.</P>
        <P>There has been just one statement on the outbreak on the Department's website. It would be helpful to consumers and the trade if there was more information, based perhaps on the Minister of State's statement today, and an update on a regular basis until we are in the clear in regard to this entire outbreak. I would like an assurance from the Minister of State on this matter. There is a need for a detailed audit of all the farms and factories in Thailand from where poultry is exported. This should be put in place before licences are renewed. We have become aware of the requirement in this case. I have a genuine concern that there is a hidden agenda about which we know nothing.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins referred to nitrofurans, a problem caused by poultry from Thailand. We did not appear to learn a lesson from this. We must tighten significantly the controls. I put it to the Minister of State that there is a need for much greater investment in food safety in regard to both home-produced and imported products arising from this incident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the House that our Department, together with the other relevant Departments, is totally committed to supporting the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the outstanding work it does. We have led the way and supported it. There was consensus that in all these issues there would be one final arbiter to make a decision on all food safety matters, that is, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P><Col N="268"/>
        <P>I assure Deputy Upton that the statement I put on the record of the House this evening will be on our website by tomorrow. We will keep abreast of the situation and, if necessary, we will put a weekly statement on the website based on the information available to us. I will request the food and veterinary office of the European Union, on behalf of the Department, to ensure that a critical audit is carried out and that the necessary controls are visited again to make sure there is no threat to either human or animal health, not just in Ireland but throughout the European Union. In so far as we can ask it, we will certainly do so. The House can be assured that we will give the matter our constant attention on behalf of the people of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has made many comments on mushrooms. If he could get the taste back into mushrooms he would do us all a great service because they have become tasteless over time.</P>
        <P>I believe this matter is the tip of an iceberg. There has been a monumental cock-up by the EU. It was led by the Thai Government which knew for several months that there was a difficulty, but it put the interest of its own industry ahead of consumers. Will the Minister of State agree that this is an ideal opportunity for Ireland to take the lead in the EU and perhaps bring in the officials of the Thai Government. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Newin Chidchob, is a very ambitious nationalistic politician &mdash; I do not know who is his equivalent in Ireland. He threatened in recent weeks to sue the media because the reports of bird flu were unfounded. This man spoke to Commissioner Byrne last week and assured him there was no difficulty, but now there is a difficulty.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State agree that his statement that the European Commission acted quickly and appropriately is totally inaccurate. It did not act quickly and appropriately, and this will be borne out in the weeks ahead. Will he agree that Ireland should take a lead in the EU? We keep hearing that non-EU products do not have to meet the same production requirements as we must do. There are doubts among consumers and others. One cannot bake a loaf of brown bread or kill a turkey down the country without being hauled in, yet there are massive food scares that need to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be appropriate for me, my colleagues or the Government to haul in anybody from Thailand. This is a matter for the EU. Ireland has an accreditation system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that we hold the Presidency of the EU we should get to the bottom of this.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="269"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it quite clear that we will consult the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Union. Its job is to ensure that standards, criteria and regulations exist and that these are implemented to protect the consumers of the Union.</P>
        <P>We have our own system to make sure there is a double check on any products entering the country through the Union. We will take this matter up and give it our utmost attention, as we always do. The Commission did react swiftly and we are quite satisfied that there is no threat to either the health of the people or of the poultry industry in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State concluded with the statement that he is quite happy there is no threat posed. Yesterday the World Health Organisation warned that the outbreak of the contagious bird influenza virus in Asia posed &ldquo;a significant risk&rdquo;. It was not only talking about the region in Asia where the outbreak took place but also about the fact that, because of the nature of the particular virus, it has the potential to spread and spread quickly. This has already been the case. The virus is not confined to Vietnam and Thailand but it has also presented itself in a number of other countries, including Pakistan.</P>
        <P>I remain very concerned and wish to impress this concern on the Minister of State. I have taken on board and listened carefully to the assurances he has given regarding the steps he and the Department will now seek to be employed to allow for the best possible guarantee that we are properly safeguarded against the potential risk.</P>
        <P>How does the Minister of State respond to the World Health Organisation's stated views of yesterday and the statement of the chief executive of the Consumers' Association of Ireland, Michael Kilcoyne, who indicated that all non-labelled and untraceable poultry products should be removed from our supermarket shelves as a clear indication to all consumers that we are taking the risk seriously and that every possible measure is being taken to guarantee their health and, in my view, as a direct consequence, the future of the indigenous poultry industry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to consider the World Health Organisation's statement in its totality in that it said there was a significant risk to those who came into contact with live birds in the eight relevant countries in south-east Asia. Of course we must take this into account as we look at the poultry products coming into Ireland, which are composed of dead meat. There is now a clear ban on all such products entering the country since 1 January. We do not envisage any threat in Ireland.</P><Col N="270"/>
        <P>On the statement by the Consumers' Association of Ireland that all non-labelled and untraceable products be taken off the shelves, I am quite confident that Irish retailers, given their professionalism and integrity, will be the first to remove products if there is a doubt about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State assure us that he and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, will use the next five months to make sure structures are put in place so we will know where chicken meat and other meats are produced rather than how they are manufactured. Our consumers and producers are no more or less disadvantaged than anybody else. To focus on manufacturing is not good enough as we want to know where products are produced and that they are produced according to the same health standards as our own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, and I, along with our respective teams of outstanding officials, will do our utmost through the Irish Presidency to achieve a consensus on the acceptability of an EU-wide labelling system.</P>

    <Title>Civil Registration Bill 2003: Order for Second Stage.</Title>
    <P LI="1">Bill entitled an Act to provide for the reorganisation, modernisation and naming of the system (to be known as the Civil Registration Service or, in the Irish language, an tSeirbh&iacute;s um Chl&aacute;r&uacute; Sibhialta) of registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths (including certain births and deaths occurring outside the State), to provide for the extension of the system to decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage and for those purposes to revise the law relating to the system, to amend the law relating to marriages and to provide for related matters.</P>

    <Title>Civil Registration Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring the Civil Registration Bill 2003 before the House. It provides a new legislative framework for civil registration, supports and enables the modernisation of the Civil Registration Service and facilitates the <Col N="271"/>decentralisation of the General Register Office to Roscommon. The main objectives of the Bill are to: rationalise the procedures for registering births, stillbirths and deaths; give an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir responsibility for the overall policy for the Civil Registration Service, including maintaining standards of service; assign responsibility for the management, control and administration of the Civil Registration Service at local level to health boards; streamline the existing procedures governing the registration of adoptions; establish new registers of divorce and civil nullity; reform the procedures governing the registration of marriages; and facilitate the future linking of life-events.</P>
      <P>Civil registration was introduced in Ireland in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and expanded in 1864 for the registration of births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages. Thus, a comprehensive registration system has been in place since 1864. The data forms a basic, continuous source of information about the population by providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence which has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liabilities, status and nationality.</P>
      <P>Civil registration touches on each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered. Between those events, civil registration affects us both directly, as in the case of marriage, or indirectly, when certificates are required for many of the services that are available in our society, such as enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment and claiming a social welfare payment, to mention but a few.</P>
      <P>While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in our society, major developments in technology and increased expectations by citizens as to how public services should be delivered. In 2003, there were over 110,000 life events registered, some 500,000 certificates produced and approximately 1.2 million searches of registration records carried out.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance of civil registration and acknowledging the changing needs of our customers, the Government approved a programme of work to modernise the Civil Registration Service. The civil registration modernisation programme is a joint initiative between my Department, which is progressing civil registration legislation, and the Department of Health and Children, which oversees the administration of the Civil Registration Service. This is a major undertaking involving: the introduction of modern technology providing on-line registration; electronic certificate production <Col N="272"/>and the capture of digitised signatures; redesign of business processes and procedures; capturing and storing in electronic format all paper-based records from 1845; and reform of legislation which has given rise to this Bill.</P>
      <P>A key step in the process was the publication of a consultation document entitled Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st Century which set out the context and proposed future approach to civil registration and related services. The purpose of this document was to engage with as wide a range of organisations and individuals as possible on the proposals to modernise the service. Some 170 responses to the consultation document were received and these, together with views obtained during consultations with a number of organisations, have been considered in the development of the modernisation programme.</P>
      <P>There will be substantial benefits, both tangible and intangible, arising from the modernisation programme. These include: improved service to customers, for example extended opening times; greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduction in red tape; nationwide standards for registering life events; the registration of divorces and civil annulments on a central register; the electronic capture and transmission of all vital statistics on life events to the Central Statistics Office; the sharing of data with designated Government Departments and agencies; facilitating long-standing plans to decentralise the General Register Office to Roscommon; and reducing the demand for paper certificates for the purposes of Government services.</P>
      <P>As part of the groundwork for the programme of modernisation, Deputies will recall that amendments to a number of the provisions of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts were included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 to facilitate the implementation of a new computerised system to cater for the electronic registration of births and deaths and electronic certificate production for births, deaths and marriages. I am pleased to inform the House that the roll out of the new civil registration system is well under way and is currently operating in five health board areas. It is expected that the implementation of the system in the remaining health board areas will be completed by mid-2004.</P>
      <P>Until now, the registration and certificate production processes were manual, time consuming and location dependent. The modernisation programme marks a fundamental change in the way the civil registration service operates and is delivering significant improvements in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to improving public services by modernising the way it does its business. New Connections, the Government's <Col N="273"/>information society action plan, identifies e-Government as a key infrastructural mechanism and the e-inclusion programme as a key supporting framework. In line with this Government's commitment to improving the way services are organised, integrated and delivered to customers, my Department initiated a number of significant programmes. These are the civil registration modernisation project, development of the REACH interagency messaging service, automated establishment of public service identity in respect of children born in Ireland and the service delivery modernisation project.</P>
      <P>The capacity to share data is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery. To facilitate the sharing and e-enabling of life event data between Government agencies, REACH developed an interagency messaging service, IAMS, which is currently being used to transfer registration data between the civil registration system, this Department and the Central Statistics Office. This facility will be used to make death registration data available electronically to other Government agencies from the end of January.</P>
      <P>The service delivery modernisation programme aims to deliver a high quality, proactive service to customers. The re-design of the child benefit system is the first manifestation of the new service delivery framework. Since September 2003, all new birth registration data is transferred electronically to my Department from the civil registration computer system. This facilitates the allocation of a personal public service number to a child at registration, thus establishing a child's public service identity and the creation of family links on the national central database for all citizens, the client records system which is administered by my Department, initiation of a child benefit claim for first-born children and automatic payment for second and subsequent children in a family. Payment of child benefit in respect of a baby born and registered by the civil registration system on Monday is made or the mother contacted by my Department by Thursday without any manual intervention. This is a prime example of the e-Government objective of Departments working together to provide more convenient access to services for citizens. The introduction of the new civil registration system is therefore a flagship initiative in providing life-centred services to customers.</P>
      <P>The visible improvement from the customer perspective is that a single interaction with a public service agency, for example, the registration of a birth, not only achieves its original purpose but also triggers a series of related services by another agency, in this case my Department. Customers availing of the e-enabled service no longer have to source and <Col N="274"/>complete a multi-paged paper application form and supply a paper birth certificate. They simply have to register the baby's birth to set the process in motion.</P>
      <P>I now wish to outline the provisions contained in this Bill. As Members have already considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions.</P>
      <P>The administration of the Civil Registration Service is provided for in Part 2 of the Bill. Sections 7, 9 and 12 provide for the continuation of the existing offices of an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the assistant to an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, to be named an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir C&uacute;nta, and Oifig an Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheora.</P>
      <P>Section 13 provides powers for an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to establish and maintain registers of births, stillbirths, adoptions, deaths and marriages, divorce and civil nullity &mdash; the last two mentioned are new registers. In future, all life events will be stored in electronic registers.</P>
      <P>Sections 14 and 15 provide for the establishment of local registration authorities, which will be based on the health boards, that will appoint a superintendent registrar to administer the service at local level. Each registration authority will be required to set out a formal scheme for the administration of the civil registration service in its area. This part also contains provisions which facilitate the delegation of certain functions, such as late registration, from an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to local registration authorities.</P>
      <P>Part 3 of the Bill provides for the registration of births and stillbirths. The principal responsibility for registering a birth will remain with the parents, who will be required to register the event within three months of the birth. To facilitate parents in fulfilling this obligation, the present time limit of 42 days will be extended to three months. In future, births may be registered with any registrar as opposed to the present system where a birth can only be registered by the registrar of the district in which the birth occurred.</P>
      <P>Sections 23 and 24 of the Bill allow a birth to be re-registered to include the father's details where they were not entered in the register at the time of registration.</P>
      <P>Sections 26 and 27 provide for the registration of certain births occurring outside the State. This includes the birth of a child to an Irish citizen in jurisdictions where no registration system exists or the registration records are unavailable, on Irish registered ships and aircraft, to an Irish citizen on foreign ships and aircraft and to members of the Defence Forces and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while serving abroad. The provision for births on aircraft is being introduced for the first time. In addition, this provision addresses the present anomaly where the birth of a child on <Col N="275"/>board an Irish registered ship, in certain circumstances, cannot be registered.</P>
      <P>Sections 28 and 29 provide for the registration of stillbirths. In future, parents or a relative may register the stillbirth within 12 months. Currently, only the parents can register the stillbirth within 42 days. The new provisions are being introduced to allow the family of the child more time to undertake the necessary registration procedures while coping with their loss.</P>
      <P>Section 30 will require institutions, including hospitals, to notify the local registration authority of the occurrence of each birth and stillbirth. This obligation also falls on doctors and midwives where such events occur outside these locations. This notification will be recorded electronically and will assist parents in their registration obligations at the registrar's office of their choice.</P>
      <P>Part 4 of the Bill provides for the registration of adoptions. In future, there will be one adoption register for the registration of all adoptions in the State. Currently, adoptions are registered in either the adopted children's register for adoptions effected within the State, or the foreign adoption register for foreign adoptions. An authorised officer of the Adoption Board will act as registrar for the purposes of these registrations.</P>
      <P>Section 35 provides that access to the register of adoptions, or an index, which makes traceable the connection between this register and the register of births will not be available except by order of the Adoption Board or a court order, and only when it is in the best interests of the adopted person concerned to do so. This continues an existing provision. However, the index to the register of adoptions will continue to be accessible.</P>
      <P>Part 5 of the Bill concerns the registration of deaths. Section 37 provides that the primary responsibility for the registration of a death remains with the next of kin or persons who would have knowledge of the particulars of the death. This section also extends the list of persons who may provide details of a death to include specified staff of a hospital or institution where the death occurred, and undertakers. The period for registering a death is also being extended from five days to three months from the date of death. In future a death may be registered at any registrar's office. These measures allow greater flexibility for the person responsible for registering a death.</P>
      <P>Sections 38 and 39 provide for the registration of deaths which occur on ships, aircraft or deaths of members of the Defence Forces or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while serving abroad. These measures are similar to the provisions of sections 26 and 27 which provide for the registration of certain births occurring outside the State.</P><Col N="276"/>
      <P>Part 6 of the Bill provides for the registration of marriages. I intend to bring forward significant amendments to this part of the Bill on Committee Stage, in order to progress some reform of marriage law, and I will outline these proposals to the House later. There are different requirements to be met, depending on the form of marriage, be it civil or religious. These requirements can be complex and I feel there is a strong need for clarity and simplicity in this area.</P>
      <P>The current rule requiring a couple to notify the registrar of marriages of the district at least three months before the intended date of marriage will continue in force. This was introduced in the Family Law Act 1995 in order to give couples intending to marry an opportunity to reflect on the seriousness and importance of the commitment that they are making. Accordingly, section 46 of the Bill provides that three months notification of marriage must be made in person to a registrar and in a prescribed form. The current arrangement whereby a couple may apply to a court for an exemption to the three months notification rule, because of extenuating circumstances, will remain. In specified circumstances a couple will be allowed to submit the three month notification in writing, for example, where the couple is living outside the State. However, in all cases, the couple will be required to attend at the registrar's office at least five days prior to the intended date of marriage to sign an undertaking that there is no lawful impediment to the marriage and to produce other necessary documentation.</P>
      <P>Section 48 of the Bill introduces a new marriage registration form. This form will only be produced and given to a couple when they have completed all civil preliminaries for marriage. This is a very important document as no marriage can be solemnised without it. It is to be signed immediately after the ceremony by all the parties to the marriage. Responsibility for returning the completed form to a registrar lies with the couple who must do so within one month of the date of the marriage.</P>
      <P>Part 7 of the Bill provides for the registration of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity by the courts service in new registers in accordance with section 13.</P>
      <P>Part 8 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions related to civil registration. Section 52 provides for the introduction of a formal appeals system for the first time. This will allow persons to appeal a decision of a registrar or an authorised officer to an appeals officer of the local registration authority.</P>
      <P>Section 53 provides for the conditions necessary for searches of registration records. Civil registration records are a matter of public record. At present anyone can carry out a search and obtain a certificate of any event by payment <Col N="277"/>of a specified fee. The introduction of electronic registers and the electronic capture of all paper-based records will provide easier and faster access to registration records and will improve customer service. The provisions of this section of the Bill allow any person to search the indexes to all the registers and to purchase copies of the records relating to these searches with the exception of the index of stillbirths, and an index which makes traceable the connection between an entry in the register of adoptions and the corresponding entry in the register of births.</P>
      <P>Section 58 allows an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to share certain registration information for specified purposes with designated Government Departments and agencies. This provision in the Bill will facilitate the sharing of information, reduce form filling and the need for certificates for the administration and control of schemes and services.</P>
      <P>Section 59 makes provision for the Minister for Health and Children to make regulations for the charging of fees, for example, for issuing certificates, undertaking the re-registration of an event, marriages, etc.</P>
      <P>The required particulars to be entered in the register of births, stillbirths, adoptions, deaths, decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. A number of items in addition to those currently recorded are being included in each register. The enactments being repealed are listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>In order to produce an updated Bill on civil registration it was necessary to examine existing legislation and identify those provisions which are obsolete, needed to be restated or retained. As a result, including those associated with the amendments to marriage law which I will outline shortly, a total of 28 Acts dating back to 1844 are being repealed in whole or in part. Of this total, 12 Acts were passed in the 19th century. This work alone is a clear example of the Government's commitment to regulatory reform.</P>
      <P>As indicated earlier, I intend to bring forward a number of amendments to Part 6 of this Bill, which relates to marriage law, on Committee Stage. These provisions arise from recommendations of the interdepartmental committee on the reform of marriage law. Among the issues identified by the committee as requiring examination was the need for a universally applicable framework of clear and simple procedures to underpin the solemnity of the marriage contract. The amendments make provision for: outlining the substantive requirements for the solemnisation of a valid marriage, and for an interpretation service at the marriage ceremony where necessary; flexibility in respect to the time and venue at which a marriage may take place and for the payment of fees where <Col N="278"/>a civil marriage is conducted by a registrar at a location other than at a registrar's office; and the establishment and maintenance of a new register of solemnisers, which will replace the current register of churches and registered buildings. Only registered solemnisers and members of religious bodies temporarily authorised to do so may solemnise a marriage. The amendments provide for: the procedures to be followed by a religious body or local registration authority when applying to have one of its members entered in the register of solemnisers and to enable an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to cancel an entry in this register; the introduction of an appeals system which gives a person the right to appeal a decision of an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to refuse to register him or her in the register of solemnisers or cancelling his or her entry in that register; and an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to grant a temporary authorisation to a member of a religious body to solemnise a specific marriage or solemnise marriages only within a specified time. This is being provided to facilitate circumstances where, for example, a clergyperson may visit the State specifically to solemnise a marriage of a relative.</P>
      <P>The amendments provide for the lodging of an objection to an intended marriage to a registrar, the processing of such an objection, and for an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to publish all marriage notifications received. This is being introduced to allow such information to be made available to the public and supports the public and open nature of marriage. They also provide for an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to cancel an entry in the register of marriages in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the House that I will be introducing a number of other amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage including measures to allow for: the registration of stillbirths in specific circumstances on ships and aircraft and to members of the Permanent Defence Forces and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while serving abroad, as well as making provision for the registration of births and stillbirths occurring on board an Irish ship or an Irish aircraft prior to the commencement of the relevant section; some degree of flexibility for the Courts Service in entering details of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity into the register of decrees of divorce and register of decrees of nullity; the disclosure of information to persons engaged in medical or social research or to health board medical staff with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children &mdash; this measure restates an existing provision in section 7 of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1972 which is being repealed; and persons having possession of existing manuscript registers to return these to an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir. This provision is being introduced to ensure that the old and now obsolete register books are returned to an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir for security reasons.</P><Col N="279"/>
      <P>The amendments on Committee Stage will also provide: that references to life events specified in the Bill could also refer to such events that could have been, but were not, registered under the enactments repealed; the inclusion in section 61 of additional offences consequent to the marriage law reforms; and the inclusion in Part 5 of the First Schedule for the registration of the occupation of parents or guardians where the deceased is under 18 years of age. This is similar to a provision included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o'clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am also including a provision in this part for the registration of the place of birth of the deceased, and additional repeals of enactments relating to marriage law to be included in the Second Schedule arising from the inclusion in the Bill of the additional reforms in this area. I will also be introducing a number of minor technical amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>This Bill represents the first major reform of civil registration legislation since it was introduced in Ireland in 1845. It is also a clear demonstration of Government's commitment to regulatory reform. This means that all stakeholders &mdash; citizens, service providers and Government &mdash; will share in the benefits.</P>
      <P>The modernisation of the Civil Registration Service is essential, both in its own right as it seeks to meet the needs of a modern society, but also as part of the Government's overall strategy of improving public services. It heralds a new era for civil registration through the introduction of electronic registration and electronic registers.</P>
      <P>Our goal is that the delivery of all State services will meet the challenges of the new century. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of Irish people were forced, through economic and cultural circumstances to emigrate to Britain to earn a living through manual work, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; conscious that this group is believed to have remitted, between 1939 and 1969, the sum of 3.5 billion to this country in that period which played a crucial role in sustaining <Col N="280"/>families and communities at a time of dire poverty;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; shocked at the appalling conditions in which many of these now elderly Irish citizens are forced to live, which were depicted so vividly in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme broadcast on 22 December last;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; acknowledging that while a number of Irish Governments attempted to address some of the issues concerning the plight of this generation of Irish workers, not enough was done and that there is no excuse for the failure to tackle these issues during the Celtic tiger period;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; believing that the failure of the Government to act in a time of relative economic plenty and especially the shocking decision to cut funding for D&Iacute;ON by 5% in 2003 is a particular stain on its record;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; condemns the failure of the Government to implement the recommendations made by the Task Force on Policy Regarding Emigrants, published in August 2002;</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash; calls for the early implementation of the report's recommendations particularly the establishment of a new structure to co-ordinate the provision of services for Irish emigrants and communities abroad, the Agency for the Irish Abroad; and the establishment of a funding scheme for the provision of care and support services to elderly returning emigrants in supported housing accommodation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Howlin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask colleagues on all sides of the House, in a non-adversarial way, to support and endorse this Labour Party motion because our emigrant countrymen, mainly male, middle aged or older emigrants of the 1950s and 1960s, deserve no less from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. There are no votes in this motion; there is no electoral dividend for the Labour Party but we owe this to our fellow countrymen or at least to those who have fallen on hard times in Britain and elsewhere. This country failed them when they were forced to emigrate and when we exported them without a decent level of formal education. We took their English pounds and accepted their American dollars because we desperately needed them at the time but we gave them back little or nothing.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments regarded them as our vanished people and conveniently forgot them. In more recent times, there were efforts, for example through the establishment in 1984 of D&Iacute;ON by my colleague Deputy Quinn, to make some restitution but not nearly enough. It is <Col N="281"/>difficult to believe that while we wasted millions of taxpayers' money throughout the years of the Celtic tiger we failed to address the very real human needs of the people we shipped out in the 1950s, many of them ill-equipped for their new environment. It is even more unbelievable that recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in August 2002 by a Government appointed task force on emigrants remain on the shelf.</P>
        <P>This is an important motion in that it gives the House an opportunity to debate the content of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary transmitted before Christmas on the conditions in which many of our citizens, men who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s to work on the building sites, now live in Britain. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, will address the wider canvass in his contribution. This motion concerns a debt we owe as a people and a State, a national debt to those, our own, then young, men who, through the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s, were forced by dint of necessity to emigrate mainly to Britain. As a result of failed economic policy at home they could find no work, no living in the then Ireland but there was work in Britain. There these men laboured hard, regularly in appalling and dangerous conditions, often facing racial prejudice, to rebuild a war-damaged country and the necessary infrastructure of the post-war British welfare state. Through their hard-earned remittances home they put food on tables, clothed families and enabled those families achieve some modest standard of living in a poverty-ridden moribund economy. Emigrants' remittances, the money sent home to Ireland by these men, were also economically important, for example, in respect of the State's balance of payments figures.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that between 1949 and 1989, more than 800,000 people were forced to leave Ireland, approximately one-fifth of the current population of the State. Approximately half this outflow occurred during the 1950s. The nadir was reached in 1955 when 55,000 young people left our shores. That migration included many tens of thousands of these young men, as they then were, who went to work on construction sites abroad.</P>
        <P>We have some accounts of how these men lived, none better than Donall MacAmhlaigh's <i>Dialann Deora&iacute;</i>, an Irish language classic first published in 1964 and in 1970 translated into English as <i>The Irish Navvy &mdash; the Diary of an Exile</i>, by the poet and diplomat, Valentine Iremonger. The current publisher of the Iremonger translation in a marketing description of the book atmospherically captures its content: &ldquo;Backbreaking, blister-making work, followed by pints of the black stuff in the Admiral Rodney, the Shamrock, the Cattle Market Tavern ... Workless and foodless days, the hardships of <Col N="282"/>work camps, lonesome partings after trips home, periods of intense isolation and occasional bitterness were also part of the picture.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We also have a film record, the work of the British documentarist, Philip Donnellan, in his 1965 film &ldquo;The Irishmen: An Impression of Exile&rdquo; made for, but never shown by the BBC, which as it happens was made in roughly the same period and portrays much of the same world as described by Donall MacAmhlaigh in his diary.</P>
        <P>Young people in Ireland today probably have little awareness or understanding of what the life of the Irish in Britain was like then &mdash; the backbreaking labour, the danger and the overtime, the exploitation by their own, and the British ethnic prejudice, &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo;, hardly an improvement on the edict that faced an earlier generation on arriving in Canada, &ldquo;Connaughtmen and horned cattle to the far platform!&rdquo;</P>
        <P>As Damian Harman described in his great study of 1950s migration, <i>Rural Exodus</i>, many if not most of these young men, some no more than youths, were ill-prepared for the world to which they were migrating. They had no desire to go but Ireland then was in the words of the historian Joe Lee, &ldquo;A sluggish society clinging to the possessor principle.&rdquo; Until the late 1950s our native Governments did not see employment or economic development as real priorities; they saw full employment as unattainable and emigration as a necessary safety valve, something to save them from inevitable social unrest. Indeed as recently as 1991 the then T&aacute;naiste, the late Brian Lenihan commented: &ldquo;This country is too small to support all her people.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>These men had to go. In many cases, they were grossly exploited by their employers &mdash; in many instances Irish contractors and subcontractors &mdash; under the system known as the &ldquo;lump&rdquo;, a black economy system that still survives, including in Ireland, as anyone who knows the inner workings of the construction industry knows. The &ldquo;lump&rdquo; put many of them outside the social insurance system, now a serious problem in later life from the point of view of, for example, pension entitlement.</P>
        <P>It has been said of this migration that these men disappeared in silence while domestically, their emigration was a silent haemorrhage, treated by denial. While some managed to return home many more did not. Many of them, including Donall MacAmhlaigh, settled in Britain and made good, fulfilling lives for themselves and their families and played no little role, including in Labour Party politics and the broader labour movement, in the building of modern Britain. However, many also did not or could not return home and did not make for themselves successful lives in Britain and are now incapable of work or beyond working age, living lonely lives in poverty and ill-health, homelessness and squalor, ageing <Col N="283"/>survivors of a way of life which thankfully has changed in the main for the better, although remnants of it remain.</P>
        <P>The documentary made by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; most graphically brought home to everyone who saw it the conditions in which these men live, the homelessness, problems of poor accommodation, the health problems, the scourges of alcoholism, depression and suicide and the work of the British social services and Irish voluntary social groups assisting them. The establishment in 1984 by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, of the State committee, D&Iacute;ON, as a grant-giving agency aiding and assisting voluntary care agencies meant that the State recognised the debt owed to these men and the duty we owe them as Irish citizens. It is perhaps some measure of the scale of the problem that in 2002 these D&Iacute;ON-assisted agencies throughout Britain dealt with 30,000 people.</P>
        <P>There is perhaps some tendency to think of this problem as essentially a London one. It is true that the scale of the problem is significant in London but that is by way of the nature of things. It is not confined to London. One indication of this was the remark made by Ellen Stagg who, with her husband Michael in 1993, established the Coventry Mayo Association. Speaking at a fund-raising event in Mayo last April she said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The youngsters are in their fifties. Many of the older people, in their seventies, are lonely and isolated, particularly from the Irish community and its culture. Some of them need the help and support of the people of Ireland and of the younger people in Coventry.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is not exclusively a problem of rural migrants either since many of those involved in the migration came from Dublin.</P>
        <P>The recognition given through D&Iacute;ON has been insufficient, most woefully so during the years of the economic boom &mdash; the so-called Celtic tiger years. To add insult to injury, last year the allocation was cut to &euro;2.5 million compared to &euro;2.7 million in 2002. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, speaking in London last July told his audience this cut &ldquo;represents a continuing and high level of support for the Irish voluntary sector in Britain&rdquo;. The Government also argued that the fall was offset by exchange rate gains, while the Taoiseach's very own &ldquo;Mary from Dungloe&rdquo;, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, had the gall to tell a London gathering in July, at the launch of the Irish Pensioners Network of Great Britain, &ldquo;We in Ireland are in your debt because all of you contributed so much to the Irish economy when times were hard.&rdquo; How has this Government shown its indebtedness? By nothing other than the binning of the report and recommendations of the task <Col N="284"/>force of experts which it established to advise on an appropriate course of action for Government policy regarding emigrants.</P>
        <P>On the 5 February last in an Adjournment debate, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, described the report as &ldquo;a milestone in the process of developing a coherent long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs&rdquo;. That is a sure indication that the Government had not the slightest intention of acting on the recommendations, especially the financial ones. These were for a significant increase in funding for immigrant services world-wide, representing some &euro;18 million for 2003, increasing to &euro;34 million in 2005, with &euro;8 million of this for welfare services in Britain in 2003, rising to &euro;12 million in 2005. This may be a significant increase but it is paltry in the context of the sums wastefully spent by the Government.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I received an invitation to the launch by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, of his shiny new electronic voting and counting system at a cost of &euro;36 million. There was no electronic voting when we drove these men out and the shiny new equipment will not count them now.</P>
        <P>This year's Estimate of &euro;4 million is no more than half what the task force recommended as an appropriate cash allocation for Britain for last year. Another of the report's recommendations, namely, the transfer of responsibility for emigrant policy to the Department of Foreign Affairs, including the transfer of D&Iacute;ON from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, simply became the occasion for a cynical exercise in pass-the-parcel. Not for either of these fine upstanding, thrusting, modern Departments and their Ministers anything as un-modern and unfashionable as caring for old men in Camden Town. The policy of this Government amounts in effect to paying lip service to our debt, <i>&agrave; la</i> Deputy Coughlan, wishing that it would go away or, even worse, &ldquo;Leave it to the Brits&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The late Valentine Iremonger, an officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs, could devote his considerable literary talent to giving us a fine translation of Donall MacAmhlaigh's <i>Dialann Deora&iacute;</i>. I am both surprised and disappointed that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs can find neither the time nor commitment to give real effect to the recommendations of the task force, which he received in August 2002. It shows how far the third generation of Fianna F&aacute;il has grown away from its roots.</P>
        <P>There is another aspect to Donall MacAmhlaigh's book, an important theme relating to a different sphere of public policy, another aspect of the rural exodus. This is his lament for the linguistic loss represented by much of this cruel emigration. Many of the men came <Col N="285"/>from Gaeltacht areas and were native speakers. MacAmhlaigh observed:</P>
        <P LI="1">If any of them get married over here . . . it is in English their family will be reared, even if they themselves speak the old tongue, as a lot of the Gaeltacht people here do. So all this Irish that could be handed on to another generation is going to waste. Seeing that this is so, it's a miserable Government that won't do their best to keep these people at home.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This miserable Government cannot even get its act together on the question of official status for the Irish language as a language of the European Union. This miserable Government refuses to get its act together in respect of the stark tragedy that is the situation in which many of our elderly citizens in Britain, men who through their remittances in the 1950s and 1960s kept families and communities at home going, tragically now find themselves. This miserable Government has a duty to assist those in London and other British cities who do excellent work on shoestring budgets with the &ldquo;vanished people&rdquo; that some in the modern Ireland would prefer to forget.</P>
        <P>The poet and patriot Joseph Campbell in 1913 wrote the poem <i>The Emigrant</i>, the final verse of which is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Five hours will see me stowed aboard,</P>
        <P LI="1">The gang-plank up, the ship unmoored.</P>
        <P LI="1">Christ grant no tempest shakes the sea,</P>
        <P LI="1">Farewell to barn and stack and tree.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I commend this motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important topic.</P>
        <P>I am limited by time in the references I can make to the research which has been carried out. The topic has been researched to death but what has been needed is response to and action on the recommendations which have been made. Most recently, the task force on policy regarding emigrants reported and, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, its recommendations should be implemented. However, there have been several other studies. I recall attending some of them as I began carrying out research in this area in another life in 1969.</P>
        <P>I remember attending presentations of research from the Irish in Britain research forum in 1988 when the cause and nature of the problem was laid out. It is important to realise we are referring to Irish women as well as men. The Irish women in the modern period are divided into two clear groups, namely, those who went into nursing and those who today occupy a disproportionate number of jobs in the service sector in cities like London.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the makers of the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme of December 22 last and all <Col N="286"/>those voluntary agencies and individuals who have worked over the years with the Irish in Britain, particularly those who have found themselves on the margins of society.</P>
        <P>The report of the task force to which I have made reference was published in August 2002 and made some specific recommendations. The Labour Party motion makes reference to the miserable cut in 2003 to the funding for D&Iacute;ON in Britain. Having attended some of the meetings in Brent, Haringey and Islington, I can see the limits of D&Iacute;ON's access to the Irish, some of whom are in the worst conditions.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we have so immiserated ourselves at home that we are now incapable of considering a problem which was in front of our faces in London at the end of the 1980s and earlier. We have spoken with such lack of precision about the problem, even though the evidence is there. I will refer later to the number of people who worked on the buildings on the &ldquo;lump&rdquo;. They met at 6 a.m. in Camden Town and were picked up to be driven to sites. There is a significant difference in the terrible conditions they endured, which were recorded in books such as Ultan Cowley's, <i>The Men Who Built Britain</i>, and earlier works by novelists such as Patrick McGill.</P>
        <P>Even though there were no facilities for food, the work was long and people were pushed into pubs, the semblance of a rough social organisation was kept together. As the economy of Britain changed and that form of road building no longer predominated, the workers found themselves in urban settings being recruited for projects in twos and threes. They grew old carrying the burden of injuries received without social insurance and health protection.</P>
        <P>All the analysis is inclined to forget the importance of life cycles in the structure of the migratory experience. A total of 59,000 people were exported from Ireland in 1957, only a year before the first programme for economic expansion. The Central Bank was sending messages to the Government that the economy could not continue as it was and T. K. Whitaker was shuttling between the Department of the Finance and the Central Bank every day before the new programme was introduced.</P>
        <P>In the decade that surrounded that programme, the number of emigrants never fell below 30,000 and many were female. During an earlier post-Famine migration between 1881 and 1891, women outnumbered men. One of the reasons was the railways. British Rail carried people and offered them accommodation and a job. My sisters emigrated to Manchester in this fashion in the 1950s. The advantage was one had a place to stay.</P>
        <P>As their life cycle evolved, the people who were shown in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme grew older and were no longer able to work as they did previously. This has been highlighted in <Col N="287"/>study after study. I read a study published last year about London, which highlighted Irish emigrants resided primarily in unfurnished, private rental accommodation. They were exploited in appalling conditions by many of their own &mdash; Irish landlords &mdash; in the same way the badge of property was put on the fields following the Famine, as those who stayed at home put the stamp of ownership on the fields. They could forget those who had left but they took their dollars to build churches and to pay shop bills and rack rents and so forth. Irish people exploited Irish people in the same way.</P>
        <P>I recall a powerful image from 1968. I saw a prominent Irish builder in Britain calling into the Conservative Club in his Rolls Royce on the way to Old Trafford, not unlike today, while the people who were his pawns queued to get into the ground. Such people have always existed but we have come to a point at which we recite a regular patter abroad that Ireland is the second richest country in Europe and the fourth richest in the world and it has the fastest economic growth rate and falling unemployment. However, for good measure, Ireland has the most costly housing in Europe but no reference is made to that, or to the absence of social protection similar to that provided in the Scandinavian or other European models.</P>
        <P>An Ireland has been created to which these emigrants could not dream of returning. We have been so miserable as not even to provide for their return on holiday. It is as if we have reinvented ourselves and have amnesia about the 1950s.</P>
        <P>We never speak about the comprehensive anti-Irish racism that prevails in Britain. It abated in 1894 but those of us who have examined the literature of the time can recall the ape-like post-Darwin caricatures contained in it. These drawings were not jocular or something to laugh at as they were deeply and offensively racist. This tradition has been kept alive by the London <i>Evening Standard</i>. Why have successive Governments not pressed for the recognition of the Irish in Britain as an ethnic group?</P>
        <P>Most importantly, sufficient research has not been conducted on the sums emigrants deposited in accounts, as perhaps they pathetically sought to avoid accountability in Britain and elsewhere. These sums lie in dormant accounts. It does not take rocket science to assess how much lies in such accounts and we should have first call on it to address emigrant issues. I recall the images of people on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. The bias that existed is interesting. Irish writers have been better than Irish social scientists at recording migration. I taught the first course on the sociology of migration on this island in the early 1970s. Since then, courses have been introduced in colleges in Maynooth, Cork, Belfast and elsewhere. <Col N="288"/>However, it is as if we did not want to admit it had happened.</P>
        <P>I read letters written by people who had emigrated to the US and Australia. We stopped writing to the people in Australia because there was no money in the letters and, as Liam O'Flaherty's powerful short story, <i>The Letter</i>, shows, the first thing the man checks is the money in the envelope and says there is the price of a horse in that. Those who emigrated in the 1950s began writing letters home but then, because of the circumstances in which they found themselves, they stopped writing. The time then came when they did not travel home for Christmas any more and the connection was broken. That from which they came had changed utterly and there were no networks of connection. They got lost in London and yet, as Deputy Rabbitte said, they sent money home and it built up in Irish accounts. It is listed every year.</P>
        <P>We have a long history of several migrations. One of the last waves was between 1987 and 1989. It is sometimes assumed correctly, for example, that those emigrants were better educated than those involved in the great haemorrhage of the late 1950s. However, buried in these statistics is the fact many young people from Dublin and other cities who left in the 1980s did so because they felt they could not measure up through some deficiency or other and, as the Action Group for Irish Youth and others point out, they found themselves in hostels.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, as part of the new amnesia and the construction of a suitable mentality for a rich country that does not worry about how the riches are distributed, we are too inclined to invent new attitudes to match, thus there is a subterranean, poisonous flow of anti-immigrant feeling, which, no doubt, will surface during the coming elections. A total of 57,651 harvesters arrived in England in 1841. William Cobbett described them as &ldquo;hundreds of squalid creatures tramping into London without shoes, stockings or shirts, with nothing on the head worthy of the name of hat and with rags hardly sufficient to hide the nakedness of their bodies&rdquo;. It is part of the intellectual trappings of a modern country advertising itself as rich that it would produce attitudes to match towards people who travel to these shores, whom we should welcome.</P>
        <P>Following four year's work in this area, I found that one feature that characterised Irish migration in the modern period, above all else, was its circulatory character, which had been neglected. Most of the images are of people leaving for America or Australia when it was a form of death. However, throughout the late 1950s people were coming and going all the time, thereby changing the values of people at home and so forth. This is supported in all the research conducted in the modern period from the Limerick rural survey through John Jackson and <Col N="289"/>others. However, what I remember noticing is that this circulating group had valuable, humane values of its own  in a kind of line from the seasonal migrants of pre-Famine days.</P>
        <P>In 1969 I met the sugar workers in Nissen huts in Telford. I heard a man speaking to his son in Irish about a deal done so that there would be a supply of labour for the British Sugar Corporation. It is when they are no longer able to circulate that they find they cannot return home because of age, a mixture of personal difficulties or absence of clothes. A returning migrant needs to come home, not only with a shirt but with the minimum to be able to present himself or herself with dignity. We have put incredible barriers between ourselves and that part of our history and this part of our own people.</P>
        <P>I find it hollow to hear people speak about a diaspora, as if we were something shaken from a pepper canister and that there was nothing involuntary in it. People were deported from this country in the 17th century and were driven from the so-called republic of the 1940s and 1950s. They were driven from homes to line up in Galway station with cardboard suitcases for b&aacute;d na himirce.</P>
        <P>We badly injured ourselves in developing a kind of blindness and being unable to respond to situations such as this. It is curious that a country of landless people always needed its landlords. Very few people speak about the agricultural labourers, most of whom were wiped out in the Famine and in the emigration that immediately followed it. Not everyone died in the Famine. Just before the land Acts of the end of the 19th century the graziers, who had both an Irish flag and a crucifix overhead them, had more land than the landlords had ever had. It is part of the contemporary definition of ourselves in Ireland of the present time that we still need landlords. In 1934, peasants would stand at the Galway races and say to the greatest gombeen of them all, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n M&oacute;r McDonagh, &ldquo;Lead him in yourself, Mr. Martin.&rdquo; In the same way, there are people forelocking the extremely rich people who have made fortunes out of speculation and State assets and who can barely stay here for 90 days. The suggestion is that the great people, the landlords and super-rich, will somehow, in an attack of philanthropy, relieve us from our obligations to the people who came from every village in Ireland and who built Britain.</P>
        <P>All the different studies have been done. We know that the study for London is different from the national study. We know how many have an Irish father or mother, how many are second generation Irish, where they are concentrated, who is in Arlington House and who is in all of the different hostels. We also know, in the most prosperous period in Irish history, that no one is lifting a finger to give back something to those <Col N="290"/>who gave to us, when people wore shoes they got in parcels and depended on letters from Britain.</P>
        <P>Let us not distort the figures. The 1998 to 1990 figures are very important. The emigrants of those years were different from those of the 1950s. In the 1950s unskilled men went to work on building sites and women went to work in nursing and service occupations. Buried within the statistics for the 1980s and 1990s are a far more vulnerable group. These are the young males not as physically strong as those of the 1950s and females who were not entering the professions, as one would expect, but who were going into the lowest paid, most vulnerable and at-risk service occupations.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to be able to support this motion. When I attended a research conference as late as April 1988 a woman spoke of having been given a voucher for 39 to go home to Ireland. Is it not interesting that we have so progressed morally that we are now offering people vouchers to go back to their homes, wherever they may be? It is time we tried to lift the burden of shame that lies on every Government that did so little for the Irish in Britain, and particularly those at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always challenging to be third in a sequence of speakers following Deputies Rabbitte and Higgins. It is particularly daunting when the subject is one in which both are so well versed, particularly Deputy Higgins who is an eminent sociologist. The issues which have been so well addressed in this debate involve a compelling moral argument for all of us, across party lines. This issue is to our collective shame.</P>
        <P>Like many of my colleagues who will speak tomorrow, I will present a local focus. I come from the maritime county of Wexford. The picture of the port of Rosslare could be replicated in almost every county in Ireland. Even in my own lifetime I remember the bleakness of visiting the port of Rosslare when people from all over the country would arrive, tanking themselves up for the journey across the Irish Sea to return to their place of work, having been home for the visit. For decades that journey took place, weekend after weekend. We all remember the summer and Christmas visits.</P>
        <P>Entire communities, villages, towns and districts survived on the remittances received from those we dispatched abroad. Their plight today is one that shames us in the wonderful light in which we present ourselves at the cutting edge of modern Europe. We are wealthy, able and self-confident but, as Deputy Higgins has so ably said, anxious to blank out a chapter of our own history and to forget those upon whose endeavour, work, sweat, commitment and very life's blood our prosperity was built.</P>
        <P>As a local public representative, I visited the various county associations in Britain. As mayor <Col N="291"/>of Wexford I have had the privilege of visiting county associations in every major conurbation in the United Kingdom. The members of those associations were always anxious to associate themselves with their native place and would often tell me that although we had often forgotten them, they had never forgotten us. We remember people coming home for Christmas, dressed to the nines and having the few bob to spend to give the pretence of prosperity, knowing that they had exhausted their entire savings for months on end to save face and to present a good image to those who were left at home.</P>
        <P>In the face of that reality, which was painted so vividly and morally compellingly in the RTE programme, the Government amendment is shameful. It acknowledges that &ldquo;some of those who left were inadequately prepared for the challenges of living abroad and require special assistance and support&rdquo;. It is their failure because they were inadequately prepared for the challenges of living abroad. This is a denial of the failure of Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s, from which they were expelled, and of the education systems that did not prepare them to have any life chances in a new environment. Those who made it were the exceptions rather than those who endured to sustain those at home. We can and must do better.</P>
        <P>It was said emigration was a safety valve. The Establishment at the time was not concerned at the haemorrhaging of the youth and best people of Ireland. It was more concerned that those who went abroad and were radicalised and understood the deficiencies of the sort of system that was bedding down in this country might come home and radicalise us.</P>
        <P>This issue goes beyond party politics and I am proud to be associated with it. I commend it to the House and hope the testimony of so many people in this debate and those reaching into this House from around the globe will impact on the Government.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue which relates to a report we have had for a couple of years. The motion was probably motivated by the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which highlighted some of the issues for the most vulnerable emigrants who unfortunately require further assistance and should, and I hope will, obtain such assistance in due course.</P>
        <P>None of us has to divide on the haemorrhaging of emigration since the time of the Famine. Joe Lee's book which has been mentioned covers the period from 1912 to 1984 and encapsulates much of our national life. Successive Governments since the birth of the State had to contend &mdash; not, they would claim, totally successfully &mdash; with difficulties and a far more hostile political and economic environment.</P>
        <P>While I do not question the sincerity of some of the emotive language used and the images portrayed in the speeches made, this problem is not one of which I am unaware. Every family has had an emigrant experience. I am the son of emigrant who went to the United States as a 15 year old in 1948. On both sides of my family <Col N="293"/>people have worked &ldquo;on the lump&rdquo; in England, Canada and the United States. In case I have to listen to the charge by the Labour Party leader that I have grown away from my roots, I am personally aware of the experience of Irish emigrants abroad for that generation, including those who have come back and those who unfortunately have not. The speakers so far have acknowledged that no Government has been enlightened or responded to the extent we would like to have seen up to now or for the future. We must take on board that history and experience. As I contribute to this debate, it is not from a position of privilege or lack of awareness.</P>
        <P>As a result of the social partners discussing the PPF, a very good proposal was made for the establishment of a task force on emigrants. There is a very stereotypical view of the emigrant experience. While this is stereotypical, it is not inaccurate in its totality. We have knowledge of the hardships borne by people who because of economic necessity involuntarily left this country for other parts of the world to find their fortune or simply to earn a living elsewhere, many of whom have assimilated well into those societies.</P>
        <P>In our understanding of that experience we have never seen the positives of emigration to the extent we could have. In other words, while very many went involuntarily, they adapted, made their lives, reared families, assimilated, contributed and in later generations continue to contribute to the building of those countries while keeping a great sense of Irishness. They have highlighted and upheld the Irish language and culture in more difficult circumstances than we had at home. I acknowledge all of this and do not argue with the contributions so far which have encapsulated that experience.</P>
        <P>Emigration is a deeply emotive subject, touching as it does, at one time or another, every family in the country. Ireland occupies a remarkable place in world emigration terms in that in recent centuries very large numbers of our people have emigrated relative to our overall population. It is estimated that, of the 3 million or so Irish citizens abroad, almost 1.2 million were born in Ireland, the equivalent of approximately 30% of the present population. However, we must look at the subject of emigration in its proper context. In statistical terms, the number emigrating from Ireland has declined very substantially in recent years. In the past 50 years there were two periods of substantial emigration, in the 1950s and the 1980s, due mainly to difficult economic and social conditions in Ireland. In the 1950s the average outflow was 40,000 per year and in the late 1980s the figure was 27,000.</P>
        <P>As a result of increasing levels of prosperity in more recent times, those days are behind us. I would love to see a follow-up book from Joe Lee covering the period since 1984. Even with the <Col N="294"/>prescience he showed in his book and the wide knowledge and erudition displayed, he could not have contemplated the level of growth, improvement and transformation we have seen since. That is not to forget the institutional memory of inadequacies of the past. However, we should recognise that thankfully we are in different circumstances now as a result of increasing levels of prosperity.</P>
        <P>While there are still some 20,000 people emigrating every year, many of these are young people who are taking a year off to see the world before they return to Ireland to settle down. Among those some still go as ill prepared and ill equipped as those who went in the 1950s. There is now net inward migration as a result of the large numbers coming here from abroad in recent years, many of them returning emigrants.</P>
        <P>We should also look behind the statistics and examine the experience of those who have emigrated. Many have created very good lives for themselves and their children and have integrated well into their adopted countries. They have made significant contributions to those countries as well as promoting a positive image of Ireland abroad. We can be proud of their achievements. The task force acknowledged this in its report. It argued that emigration should be seen in a more positive light, as part of the process of constructive engagement which has characterised Ireland's interaction with other countries for centuries. As we take up the responsibility for those who have difficulties and problems, the task force has quite properly put that perspective into the mix.</P>
        <P>We should view the emigrant experience in this wider context and not automatically see it through a prism of failure, as some commentators on occasion choose to do. Many of our emigrants have maintained the strongest links with Ireland. This has benefited the country greatly, most importantly in the past through remittances sent home. However, Irish emigrants and, in particular, their descendants have also over the years made a distinctive contribution to the development of Irish economic interests. The establishment of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board is a particularly good example of this. More recently, the acquisition of valuable skills by emigrants who subsequently returned home to live and work has greatly benefited the modernisation of our economy and country.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the experience of emigration has not been a success for everyone. We cannot but be moved by the plight of those people who gave up so much for their families at home and for their country and who now suffer health and other problems. Even today, some of our emigrants are vulnerable people who are at risk of exclusion and marginalisation and who are unable to manage abroad without special support. The reference in my amendment to the motion is <Col N="295"/>not patronising. Many involved in emigrant services confirm that there is a need to build up pre-departure services to equip people, ensure that they understand that which faces them and that they are as prepared as possible for that experience.</P>
        <P>We should not forget also that the primary responsibility for the provision of the proper care and protection for vulnerable people in any society rests with the statutory authorities in those countries. We need to forge a partnership approach, which harnesses the resources and commitment of the Government with those of host countries and of the voluntary agencies, to provide the best possible support for those of our emigrants who require it.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments have for many years provided financial assistance to voluntary Irish agencies in Britain, the United States and Australia which have been offering welfare services for vulnerable people. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many Irish people and others abroad who have established and maintained these agencies and who have done so much to help the less fortunate of their fellow citizens. They have worked tirelessly and selflessly and deserve our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.</P>
        <P>During the second wave of emigration in the 1980s, the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, established the D&Iacute;ON fund for the provision of assistance to voluntary Irish agencies in Britain. A total of over &euro;18 million has been disbursed from that fund since it was established. Since the early 1990s, assistance has been provided by my Department to voluntary agencies in the United States. Almost &euro;4 million has been allocated to services for Irish emigrants in the US since then.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise at this stage that the particular problems of elderly and isolated Irish emigrants in Britain have received special consideration and will be a high priority for us. The D&Iacute;ON committee takes particular account of this in the allocation of grants to voluntary Irish organisations in Britain which cater to the needs of elderly members of the Irish community. Over half the D&Iacute;ON fund, approximately &euro;1.3 million, went to vulnerable groups last year, &euro;873,000 went on projects for the elderly, &euro;119,000 on repatriation projects and &euro;332,000 on Traveller projects.</P>
        <P>In the 1980s we worked closely with our friends in the US Congress, notably Congressmen Morrisson and Donnelly, who were spearheading efforts to help the undocumented Irish in the US. Those efforts brought substantial benefits but did not entirely solve the problem and there continues to be an unknown number of undocumented Irish in the US. I welcome the recent initiative announced by President Bush to <Col N="296"/>try and regularise the situation of the undocumented in the United States by the introduction of a new temporary work permit scheme. This is not a total solution but it is the first inkling of improvements in the situation in America, post-11 September. The President's proposals will have to be approved by the Congress and it is too early to say what amendments may be made in the course of their passage through Congress. Nevertheless, I believe that this initiative represents an important first step in addressing the situation of undocumented foreign workers in a pragmatic and compassionate way.</P>
        <P>I do not claim that everything that has been done represents a sufficient response. On the contrary, it was precisely because the Government recognised that more should be done that it agreed, after consultation with the social partners, to establish the task force on policy towards emigrants. The background to this was the Harvey report, commissioned by the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas in 1999. That report assessed the current pattern of Irish emigration, reviewed the policy responses and services provided by the Government, the Catholic Church and other voluntary agencies and set out the main policy challenges that would arise over the ten-year period ahead. It concluded that there was a need for a Government commitment to a partnership approach to the subject of emigration and the development of a coherent and effective policy, funding and service infrastructure and recommended the establishment of the task force to which I refer. As a result of discussions leading to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed that the task force should be established.</P>
        <P>The principal purpose of the task force was to advise on the development of a coherent long-term policy approach to meeting the needs of our emigrants. I instructed that the task force be established and it held its first meeting in December 2001. It met on nine occasions and invited a number of specialists to make presentations to it. It also sought and received a wide range of submissions from members of the public and interested organisations at home and abroad. Members of the task force travelled to Britain, the United States and Australia and met a wide range of individuals and groups, as well as public representatives with an interest in Irish affairs. The task force also commissioned a research study to review existing statistical data and literature on Irish emigration in the countries that are or have been the main destinations for Irish emigrants. This study provided much useful information which assisted the task force in forming its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
        <P>I asked the task force to look at all aspects of emigration, including pre-departure services for <Col N="297"/>emigrants before they go abroad, services for emigrants after they leave the country and services to returning emigrants who wished to come back to Ireland. I also asked it to pay particular attention to the needs of young and disadvantaged emigrants, who are at greatest risk of social exclusion and marginalisation when they go abroad, and to the needs of returning emigrants, especially the vulnerable and the elderly. I stressed that what I wanted was a set of pragmatic and practical proposals that would enable concrete improvements to be made over time.</P>
        <P>I did not set any limits on the ambition of the task force. I gave it a completely free hand to make whatever recommendations it considered appropriate. The task force produced an excellent report and I want to commend individuals who served on it, in particular, the chairman, Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon, for the extraordinarily high level of their contributions and for the speed and efficiency with which they completed their work.</P>
        <P>The report sets the phenomenon of emigration in a modern and forward-looking context. It recognises the achievements of our emigrants and acknowledges their needs and provides a template for the future that will guide us in trying to meet the needs of the Irish abroad. I welcomed the report when it was published in late 2002. This was after the Estimates had been agreed for 2003 and, therefore, it could not be taken into account at that stage. I also made clear that the report contained many wide-ranging and far-reaching proposals and that their implementation would have to be phased over a period of years. I did not believe then, and this remains my view, that it would be possible to implement all of the recommendations at once, even if the level of resources advocated could be provided.</P>
        <P>On receiving the task force report, I established an interdepartmental working group to examine its recommendations and report back to me. I received the working group's report late last year. The task force made 71 recommendations, some of which overlap somewhat and fall within the remit of a number of Departments. I have asked all relevant Departments to examine those recommendations to see what progress may already have been made in advancing them and what further measures might be taken in the short to medium term to do so. Overall, I estimate that action is underway on over 50 of the 71 recommendations.</P>
        <P>My Department assumed responsibility for the D&Iacute;ON fund from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year in order to give effect to one of the task force's recommendations, namely, that funding for emigrant services abroad should be brought together under the Department of Foreign Affairs. We announced last September that we had secured an additional &euro;1 million in the Vote for the Department of <Col N="298"/>Foreign Affairs for services to emigrants in 2004. This brings the overall expenditure on such services this year to just over &euro;4 million, an increase of one third on 2003. I hope to be able to find some additional funds through savings in my Department's Vote later in the year. That will enable me to increase this amount even further.</P>
        <P>I intend to allocate the bulk of the additional &euro;1 million to the D&Iacute;ON fund. There is no doubt that Britain is the country with the largest concentration of vulnerable Irish emigrants. Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that a total of &euro;3.57 million will be allocated to the D&Iacute;ON fund this year. That represents an increase of 30% over the total expended in 2003. It is a significant increase but I am determined we can and will do better as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I have also asked that the D&Iacute;ON committee give priority, in allocating its grants this year, to areas highlighted by the task force. I have in mind in particular support for the elderly. I also want to ensure that voluntary Irish agencies are in a position to increase their own capacity to access funding from other sources as well as to improve the effectiveness of their services. That immediate priority was identified by the Federation of Irish Societies, representatives of which I met. I allocated an additional &euro;150,000, from savings to the federation in Britain to enable it to launch a major five-year capacity-building project. This is crucial if the federation and its affiliated bodies are to secure greater access to statutory and voluntary sources of funds in Britain. This represents the beginning of a process.</P>
        <P>These issues should also be addressed in the wider east-west context between Britain and Ireland. Ministers who take part in discussions with their British counterparts under this umbrella are and should be aware of this dimension. The same applies to ministerial contacts with other countries where there are large Irish populations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is not the case that funding for emigrant services in Britain was cut by 5% last year. In fact, the total amount allocated for 2003 was &euro;2.748 million, which represented a slight increase on the previous year. Funding for emigrant services in Britain, primarily through the D&Iacute;ON fund, will have increased from &euro;592,000 in 1999 to &euro;3.57 million in 2004. This is close to an overall increase of &euro;3 million during that short period. By any standards, however critical, this is a significant achievement. These figures contrast with D&Iacute;ON funding by the rainbow Government. The total amount for the three years, 1995, 1996 and 1997, came to just over &euro;2 million. This year's allocation alone is double the amount allocated during the three years of the rainbow Government.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
        <P>In the case of the United States, I propose to allocate a total of &euro;400,000 in 2004, representing <Col N="299"/>an increase of 33% on last year. I also propose to increase the funding to Australia, which is admittedly on a low base, to &euro;48,000, an increase of 25% on 2003. As in the case of the D&Iacute;ON fund, I am proposing that, as the circumstances of the emigrant community in each of the countries dictate, a proportion of these increases should be reserved for projects that would give effect to priorities identified by the task force. These include capacity building, assistance for elderly and returning emigrants and projects to promote more effective networking and information sharing between the voluntary agencies abroad.</P>
        <P>I am also determined to help the voluntary agencies in Ireland that provide assistance to intending and returning emigrants to improve the services they offer. To this end, I propose to provide a grant to &Eacute;AN, the umbrella body for Irish voluntary agencies providing services to emigrants, to assist it to provide more effective support to its members. This will help to increase the effectiveness of these agencies and will promote greater communication and co-ordination between voluntary agencies at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>I have set out in detail the resources being provided by my Department for services to emigrants this year. However, it would be misleading to conclude that this is the extent of the Government's support for the Irish abroad. Other Departments are also providing valuable assistance, particularly in the provision of pre-emigrant information and advice, and assistance to returning emigrants. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is this year providing &euro;427,000 for the co-ordination and delivery of pre-departure services and services for returning emigrants. It works closely with the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain and the Coalition of Irish Emigrant Centres in the USA providing support and information to both groups.</P>
        <P>Up to 2000, people who had paid social insurance contributions prior to 1953 could not use these for calculating entitlement to a contributory pension. However, in 2000, the Government introduced a half rate contributory pension for people with pre-1953 contributions who otherwise might not qualify. Roughly 60% of those who qualify under this scheme are people living abroad, mostly in the UK, who worked in Ireland prior to 1953 and, therefore, made the necessary qualifying contributions. This means that of the estimated expenditure this year of &euro;132.7 million under the pension scheme, approximately &euro;80 million will go to Irish people living abroad, the majority of whom live in Britain. This means a great deal to the many thousands of elderly Irish people living in Britain who are benefiting from the change made in 2000. It is a significant improvement for them.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>Another area where work is being done to improve the situation for emigrants relates to pre-departure services. There can be some misconceptions about the nature and purpose of pre-departure services. They are not designed to encourage emigration but to equip people with the skills they need to cope with the challenges of living abroad. I recall, as Minister for Labour in the early 1990s, setting up an innovative F&Aacute;S scheme designed to identify job opportunities for those who intended to work abroad commensurate to their skills. At the time I was accused of promoting emigration, being defeatist and of being prepared to let people leave rather than provide jobs at home. There was not sufficient economic activity in the country to do that. However, we were also prepared to let these people go without being prepared to acknowledge that something could be done for them when they were leaving. The issue was a political hot potato for me as Minister for Labour and for Members on the Opposition benches.</P>
        <P>I was seeking to establish a F&Aacute;S scheme whereby there would be placement officers on the Continent and in Britain to ensure that emigrants with skills could get jobs commensurate with those skills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, there is a long history to that. It was Mr. de Valera who started it. He believed it would be seen as encouraging emigration if he had preparation committees in place at the time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Plenty of people of this political generation from all sides of the House, who operate in a more benign economic and political environment, throw brickbats at the founding fathers of this State. In fairness to Professor Lee, he gives some credence to context. While one can claim that they could and should have done better, they operated in a far more hostile environment with fewer resources and less capacity than is the case now. It is a cheap shot to compare what we are achieving now with what was done in the 1940s. If we were half as good as they were&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am merely agreeing with the Minister's point. He is contextualising to the 1980s and I am saying the same attitude prevailed in the 1940s and 1950s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some Members of the House who are contributing to this debate are representatives of parties that had a great deal to say on why I should not have established that scheme. A pragmatic approach was being taken on the basis of 27,000 emigrants per year from this country. There were Members in this House who, only a decade ago, refused to acknowledge the fact that there was emigration from this country. The <Col N="301"/>attitude was that we should wipe our hands of them because it was better to do nothing than do something for them when they were going away. It is a fair point. The scheme was unique in that it was the first in the EU to have job placement officials from one EU country operating in another EU country.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has provided a total of &euro;100,000 in grant-in-aid to the Safe Home organisation over the past two years. This funding goes towards the general administrative and running costs involved in carrying out Safe Home's role in the provision of accommodation for elderly returning emigrants. The then Minister of State, former Deputy Bobby Molloy, also amended the terms of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme in November 2001, thereby providing that up to 25% of accommodation in new projects undertaken by approved voluntary housing bodies throughout the country with assistance under the scheme should be allocated to elderly emigrants returning to this country who satisfied eligibility criteria drawn up in connection with the Safe Home programme. Many emigrants who might want to come home were not eligible to go on waiting lists for housing accommodation here because they were not resident. The former Minister of State removed that barrier.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, even though the scheme has only been in force for a short time, only 153 returned emigrants have been able to be accommodated. The scheme permitted, for the first time, applicants for such housing to be assessed abroad rather than, as in the past, being required to have returned and be resident here before even being able to apply for such accommodation. Clearly, emigrants resident elsewhere could not take up possible housing accommodation under our housing policies for that reason. Greater use should be made of this scheme by increasing liaison between local authorities and voluntary housing groups here and front line services in the UK, including Irish voluntary agencies, who become aware of the conditions of eligible emigrants. If we can create this contact and co-ordination, we might be able to help many people on a pragmatic basis in that regard. I hope we can do that as a result of some of the new arrangements we will try to put in place.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations made by the task force is the proposal to establish an agency for the Irish abroad to co-ordinate the provision of services for Irish emigrants and Irish communities abroad. I would not exclude the establishment of such an agency in the future. However, the best and most effective way of using scarce funds is through the recognised and experienced voluntary agencies in the front line. They are in <Col N="302"/>the best position to direct these resources to where they can have the greatest effect for those who are most in need. The task force estimated that the annual cost of such an agency would be in the region of &euro;2 million. Clearly, if it were possible to secure the &euro;18 million being sought in the recommendations, the provision of &euro;2 million might be regarded as a justifiable expenditure. However, few Members of the House would thank me if, in the context of a significantly increased budget for support for emigrants of &euro;4 million this year, the majority of it were to be expended on administrative structures.</P>
        <P>We need to increase the level of financial support for front line services as a priority. In the meantime, during the course of the year and to acknowledge the need for better co-ordination, I intend to establish a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs to work with the voluntary agencies at home and abroad to maximise the impact of our collective efforts. Further consideration can be given to change in administrative structures after we have dealt with the necessary priority work of increasing the level of support to front line services.</P>
        <P>No Member of the House can claim to have done enough for our emigrants and nobody is contending that we have. The task force challenges us in the modern context to improve this level of service and proceed in the structured way it has set out. I do not believe we will ever be able to say we have done enough. However, with the task force report and the process of actively implementing it, we have quantifiably changed the nature of our approach. The report is a template which should not be left gathering dust on the shelf, as some would contend, but should be implemented in a structured way over the period ahead. The task is to build on what we have achieved so far as quickly as possible. I am determined to focus on priorities such as building the capacities of voluntary organisations, working closely with voluntary agencies and host governments to assist returning emigrants and those who require special support while they are abroad.</P>
        <P>When the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, an excellent report was done under the Anglo-Irish parliamentary body on Irish emigrants. It highlighted that public representatives in both Parliaments were aware of this problem. It is probably a greater problem than we, as Parliaments, identified a decade ago because of the age profile, the difficulties people are experiencing and the difficulties faced by those who are left behind.</P>
        <P>We now have a way forward. I will implement it and continue to work with the voluntary agencies. It was not possible to go from a figure of &euro;2.5 million, as those with experience of Government know, to a figure of &euro;18 million. I <Col N="303"/>did not tell the task force not to give me its optimum position. It did that and was right to do so as it is committed to this area. We are beginning to respond in a greater way than in the past. We must improve our efforts, as I have acknowledged, and will do so in the years ahead. We will have a better structure and response as a result of the work it has done which was not in vain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this important motion which goes to the heart of how we look after the people who have given so much to our society and country for many years. By going to the United Kingdom or America, they supported their families and made it possible for them to live properly at home and to be educated. Emigration has been a scourge for generations. People had to leave their homeland to work abroad, particularly in America and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>We have not given proper and due recognition to the work emigrants have done for this country for generations. One way we could do this would be to give them a stake in our electoral process. I was a member of one of the Oireachtas committees during the last Government which dealt with this issue. It considered the issue of giving emigrants a vote in presidential elections. We must consider this issue in greater detail because it would help to recognise the contribution first generation Irish people abroad have made. If they go to the consulate of their choice and produce a valid passport, we should allow them to exercise their franchise in an election such as the presidential election. They would have to register through the proper means and the onus would be on them to vote. However, if Americans in Ireland can vote in a presidential election in the United States, Irish people in America should be able to vote in our elections.</P>
        <P>Allowing our emigrants to vote here would give them a stake and an interest in what is happening in this country and would act as an agent for policy change. I acknowledge that Members are not paying lip service to the problems faced by emigrants. However, if they were stakeholders in our system, they could be a force for change, particularly as their numbers are large. A majority might vote in an election. We should recognise the responsibility and influence shown by the Irish diaspora. We take their money. Therefore, we should allow them to vote here.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>There was also a proposal that emigrants should have a voice in the Seanad, although there would be difficulties in working out the mechanics. It was proposed that when the Taoiseach was nominating his Members, he would nominate the emigrant bodies which would have to go through a transparent selection process. That would be an important recognition. Those issues should be addressed in the future.</P>
        <P>The television programme which many people mentioned to me brought home the reality of life for emigrants, particularly elderly people and those who did not have a good education or good health. Surveys in the United Kingdom show that people of Irish origin tend to have shorter lives than those from other emigrant communities. They have many health issues, including those associated with alcohol and loneliness. Many find themselves locked in a lifestyle which they enjoyed many years ago but now they do not have any friends or relatives. Although they are only a short boat trip or flight from Ireland, they do not make the effort and we do not reach out to help them. While successive Governments recognised this problem, they did not invest enough in the work done by emigrant societies. I acknowledge the tremendous work done by the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, among emigrants abroad. It is worthwhile and fruitful work which is greatly appreciated.</P>
        <P>Many young people who went to America before 11 September 2001 cannot come home because they are there illegally. The presidential election in America offers a great opportunity in that regard. President Bush made a significant statement about immigration law and how it may change. While the speculation is that it will benefit Hispanics and other significant emigrant communities in America, there is no reason we cannot use whatever influence we have with the Bush Administration and our friends in the other parties, particularly the Democratic Party, to get a better deal for Irish emigrants. We should tell them that the Irish community will support whatever party supports such an agenda for change. There is no reason it cannot be done. We should drive it forward. The Government should make representations in an effort to resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>I am sure there is not one Member of this House who does not know someone, perhaps a member of their family or community, who cannot come home when a relative passes away. I have received such calls as I am sure others have also. If the people concerned come home for a funeral, they will lose everything they have because they will not be able to go back. We must tackle this. President Bush mentioned temporary work visas and the allocation of more green cards. The agenda is there, as the Minister <Col N="305"/>acknowledged, and it was worked on by former members of Congress and the Senate. Bruce Morrisson was one of the most important and influential people in that regard. We must get our act together this year. If we do not seize the opportunity this year, it may be gone forever. We do not want that to happen. The work our emigrants do and the contribution they make to American society have always been acknowledged and welcomed, in spite of the evil visited on the world on 11 September 2001. We should use our influence and not leave any stone unturned.</P>
        <P>With increasing regularity I meet people in their 60s or 70s whose partners are gone, or dead, who return from the United Kingdom to Drogheda with nothing but who want to live at home. They need housing and a few have taken up the scheme the Minister mentioned. We should be more dynamic and challenge ourselves to meet those people's needs. We can all agree to this motion which the Labour Party has so properly put before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O'Dowd for sharing his time with me. I acknowledge the Labour Party's contribution in putting down this motion. It is some time since we had a debate on emigration, perhaps not since the late 1980s when I was a signatory to a similar motion. Coming from County Kerry I have a special interest in the emigrant question because like so many of the western seaboard counties, Kerry was very much affected by emigration. I came to know many of those who went away in the 1950s and the 1980s, first through my travels as a student then with the Kerry football team and later as a politician. Most of those people would eventually tell one that they felt they were forgotten when they left Ireland. While that is an exaggeration, the adage, &ldquo;out of sight out of mind&rdquo; prevailed, for good reason. This was not a very wealthy country and it found it difficult to look after its own population besides at times trying to look after the emigrant population.</P>
        <P>However, the moral support needed by so many was missing. More than any other group, the church made an effort to look after emigrants, for example, when I was in Australia recently I was told the Irish missionaries went out there to look after the Irish emigrants, not to convert the native people. Although the church did its best there was never a coherent policy on emigrants. A start was made in the 1980s with the establishment of the D&Iacute;ON committee but for many years the funding allocation to it did not increase from 250,000 until it was doubled at the start of the 1990s, when it remained static for several years until it was substantially increased in recent years.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P>The problems of the typical emigrant in London who unfortunately fell on bad times were housing and health. The typical Irish building workers stayed in bed and breakfast accommodation and when they stopped working had to move on, when they rented basic accommodation. However, they could not afford the increases in rents, especially in London. They were not insured and did not receive the benefits that would have been theirs had they been. Most worked with builders who did not pay insurance for them but they were not too concerned about that at the time. They were happy to receive wages at the end of the week, with no strings attached, much of which they sent home to their families. They never looked to the rainy day. Many thought about coming home some time but that connection would have been cut because of the death of their parents, their brothers and sisters had aged and their extended family did not have the same concern for them. That happens regularly, even in charitable families. The problem remains for those emigrants who went to England after the Second World War.</P>
        <P>The problems of the young Irish who went in the 1980s were different. Some were forced to live in squats and in cardboard settlements in cities and some of those got into drugs and drink or did not want to work. Many of the organisations with which I was familiar were based in London and worked hard to establish hostels and provide services for the Irish emigrant who became destitute and marginalised in various ways in the 1980s. My overall impression of those services was of many well-meaning people but much fragmentation. Groups were established in different parts of the United Kingdom and around London, all looking after Irish emigrants but not connected. The Federation of Irish Societies tried its best to pull them together but the groups were not working closely enough. There is now an umbrella group. I suggest that the Minister encourage people to work closer together and that the substantial funding he distributes be properly targeted and spent.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom is so close to us there is no reason not to identify those people who would like to come home. Local authorities could play an important role in this. Each authority should conduct an audit of those who want to return to its area. The Minister mentioned the initiative of Bobby Molloy, the former Minister of State at the then Department of the Environment and Local Government. There is no reason why we could not provide respond-type initiatives for emigrants who want to come back to Ireland. The development in Ballybunion, in which several emigrants are interested and want to take up accommodation, is very welcome. Were it replicated around the country some of the most vulnerable of our emigrants in London could be <Col N="307"/>housed. I recall going through cardboard city in London in 1989 where most of the people were Irish and Scottish, with alcohol-related problems, and I met someone from my county. It is a tragic story for some and I doubt that has changed.</P>
        <P>There are young people in America who were undocumented for some time. They were unfortunate in the various visa lottery schemes while many others applied for visas but never used them, which was very unfair. These people knew they would never use the visas but applied and never took them up thus depriving people permanently resident in America of the opportunity to take them. There is currently a reluctance to take on the three-year working visa announced by President Bush because people feel that they could be gone after three years. That is something the Minister of State might consider.</P>
        <P>There is room to honour Irish emigrants in this country. It has been done in Manchester. A Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy proposed using the Custom House. I will speak to the Minister of State later about that. Our emigrants and their efforts should be recognised in some way in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise the important issue of Clare local employment service which is due to cease operations on Friday next, 31 January, resulting in a loss of 16 full-time jobs. The LES has provided a very valuable service, particularly for the long-term unemployed, dependent partners, lone parents, people with disabilities and early school leavers.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed with the lack of response by the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Fahey, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, to my letters on the matter. I first brought the matter to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste before Christmas. She notified me on 23 December that she had passed on my correspondence to the Minister of State. I again sent correspondence to his office on 5 January and telephoned on 6 January, when I spoke to his private secretary. The only communication I received from him since was an acknowledgement of my letter from his private secretary on 19 January. I later got a similar letter from the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I understand that on 21 January, the day I got the letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, he met a deputation from Clare local <Col N="308"/>employment service, a meeting organised by the local Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Members. I was very disappointed that I was not notified of the meeting. On local radio the next day I heard a local Fianna F&aacute;il Senator talk of the meeting. As a public representative for County Clare with genuine concerns for the future of this service, I am angry that I was not updated on the intervention by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I raise the matter this evening because the loss of Clare local employment service will be a tremendous blow to the long-term unemployed and those others I have mentioned. Clare local employment service has 450 long-term unemployed on its register. Some 300 volunteered to go on the register in 2003. On 16 January, there were 4,700 people on the live register in County Clare. The first two weeks of January have seen a 3% increase in people on the live register in the county. That is a very worrying trend. The loss of the service, which is due to close next Friday, will create fear for the unemployed who desperately want a job in their community.</P>
        <P>There are allegations of bullying by several parties, and allegations of confidentiality leaks by board members. Those are not reasons to close down a very valuable service. As I said, 16 staff members got notice of redundancy before Christmas, when most people are out enjoying themselves. This is not to mention the effect the closure will have on the weakest members of our society, the unemployed.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S said it has no problem funding the service. I understood from the meeting with the Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Members that the Minister of State was to meet the board chairman. I do not know if that meeting took place as I have had no communication from the Minister of State's office. He might well contact F&Aacute;S in order to send someone to Clare to sort out the problem.</P>
        <P>With the LES due to close next Friday, I ask the Minister of State not to close the door in the face of the 16 employees and the unemployed people of Clare. I ask him to intervene and appoint a mediator to talk to both parties and sort out their differences. Every dispute can be settled and this one is no different. The T&aacute;naiste was quoted as saying that she is a big supporter of local employment services. I ask the Minister of State to contact his colleague. I am disappointed he is not here for tonight's debate. As the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs he has a duty to the unemployed people of Clare.</P>

	<P>I apologise for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has asked me to come to the House on his behalf as he is unable to be here. I am happy to have the <Col N="309"/>opportunity to respond to this issue. It is important that I put down some parameters so that the issue will be clear.</P>
        <P>The board of management of Clare local employment service, LES, advised F&Aacute;S on 15 December last that it was discontinuing operations effective from 30 January 2004. I would be very happy for Deputy Breen if the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, could prevent the closure. He too would be happy.</P>
        <P>A meeting was held in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday, 21 January 2004, between the Minister of State and representatives of Clare local employment service staff to discuss the imminent closure of the LES. Also present were a number of other Clare public representatives including the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, a union representative, two Departmental officials and two representatives of F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was I not informed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>At that meeting the staff and union representatives expressed their concerns at the suddenness of the decision by the board to close. In their view, the LES was providing a vital and necessary service for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in the Clare region and they stated that recent independent reports confirmed this. In addition, the union representative felt it was unacceptable that the board should take a decision to close the service without entering into discussions or consultations with the staff about their future.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, pointed out to those present that while the board of Clare LES is made up of representatives from the statutory and voluntary sectors, and the operation of the service is funded by F&Aacute;S, it is nonetheless a separate legal entity and the Minister of State has no role or function in relation to the internal workings of a body of this kind. It should also be noted that the full State labour relations machinery is available to assist in any negotiations on this matter, should both sides be willing to avail of this. Perhaps all the public representatives might encourage both parties to use that machinery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>We were not involved with the Minister of State's talks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated further that he was willing to talk to the chairman of the Clare LES board and to ask him if the board might reconsider its decision to close. He has since done this, but the chairman confirmed that the decision of the board to cease operations remains.</P>
        <P>Assuming that the decision of the board would not be changed, the Minister of State agreed to talk to Roddy Molloy, the director general of <Col N="310"/>F&Aacute;S, and request that F&Aacute;S immediately commence an assessment of the labour market needs of the Clare region in the context of the closure of the LES. F&Aacute;S has agreed to proceed with this assessment. As part of this exercise, F&Aacute;S will bring forward proposals on the type and level of a dedicated employment service necessary to address the particular needs of marginalized client groups in the region. The recommendations should include proposals for the delivery of the service including structures, management, staffing and other relevant requirements. Sadly, there can be no guarantees given to current staff regarding the outcome of the F&Aacute;S assessment.</P>
        <P>While it is unfortunate that a situation such as this had to arise, I assure Deputy Breen that the needs and requirements of the particular client base being dealt with by the Clare local employment service will not suffer. I have no doubt that the outcome and proposals which will hopefully emerge from the F&Aacute;S assessment of the situation will lead to an enhanced, dedicated service for all marginalized unemployed groups in the Clare area. I hope this is helpful, and if I can offer any further assistance to Deputy Breen, I will be happy to do so.</P>

	<P>I thank the Chair for his courtesy. I wish to tell my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, that I was contacted tonight by the Minister for Education and Science, which I appreciated. The Minister apologised because of his inability to attend the House because of another function arranged before this item was placed on the programme.</P>
        <P>It is very important that I make the point with regard to this local school in Kingswood Heights in Tallaght. This is something I have been involved in since I became a D&aacute;il Deputy.</P>
        <P>As one of their neighbours and a local councillor for many years, I canvassed the good people of Kingswood Heights during the general election. I was in possession of information which I accepted in good faith at the time from the Department of Education and Science, namely, that work on St. Killian's national school would be carried out. I will continue to strongly campaign for and represent the parents concerned. I compliment the local school authorities, local parish and local parents' association which do tremendous work, not just in representing St. Killian's national school but also in practical ways such as fund-raising and so on. The Department should acknowledge that this work is being done yearly.</P>
        <P>I am sincere in what I am saying about this project. I would be very grateful if the Minister of State conveyed to the Minister the strong concerns I have expressed. It is not good enough that a school which is 20 years old and caters for <Col N="311"/>more than 750 young people should have to operate under the conditions that a visit to the school in Kingswood Heights will indicate.</P>
        <P>The local Tallaght newspaper, <i>The Echo</i>, which represents local issues very well and gives Charlie O'Connor and other public representatives the odd mention stated on Thursday that St. Killian's national school would close for roof repairs. The article was entitled, &ldquo;School forced to close for repairs before roof falls in&rdquo;. It is an indictment of the system that young people who are worried about their education and being brought to school each day by their parents who are trying to do the best for them should have to deal with these issues.</P>
        <P>The report in <i>The Echo</i> also pointed out that the Department of Education and Science had been considering works on the school since 1999 and the campaign had been ongoing. Over Christmas the school suffered during the bad weather. Last Tuesday there was a further leak in one classroom which led to a corridor being flooded. All of the plastic and felt tiles on the roof must now be replaced. The report also indicated that the board of management would have to spend almost &euro;4,000 of its own funds to repair the damage, a job that will necessitate the school closing for a day.</P>

	<P>I am pleased my colleague and friend, Deputy O'Connor, has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the provision of improved accommodation at St. Killian's national school. I am aware of the enthusiasm of Deputy O'Connor in his work as a public representative in the Tallaght area. He is known to have a tremendous reputation working in a number of spheres in the area, with a particular interest in health, the environment, housing and education.</P>
        <P>With regard to the roof damage at St. Killian's national school, a member of the Department's technical staff visited the school and reported that the damaged part of the roof had been repaired. The school has been advised to complete an application under the summer works scheme for roof replacement. This new scheme caters for works that can be planned and delivered during the summer holidays. The 2004 programme will be updated in early spring to provide details of approved projects under the scheme. Perhaps the Deputy will assist the school to avail of the scheme should it so wish.</P>
        <P>A consultant working for the health and safety unit of the Office of Public Works has also visited the school to prepare a report on the asbestos in the roof. The consultant has advised that the air tests carried out are clear and the Office of Public Works will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
        <P>On a large-scale refurbishment project which will involve works in both the junior and senior schools the school is listed under section 8 of the 2004 schools building programme which is published on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to adopt a multi-annual framework for the schools building programme which will, in turn, give greater clarity regarding projects not progressing in this year's programme. The Department will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</P>

    <Title>Speech Therapy Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>There are hundreds of children with special needs and several hundred in need of special speech and language therapy. There are three speech and language therapists in the Western Care Association area, which is not sufficient. The Western Health Board community care service does not cater for children with special needs, even though they have very special needs.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a big turnover of speech therapists. They do not seem to stay to pass on their valuable experience gained working with Down's syndrome children. I wonder why they appear to drift into the private sector. There is a scarcity of speech therapists. Places have been increased to train more of them but the problem did not happen today or yesterday. Successive Governments are to blame for the deficit. Rationing occurs when resources are scarce. Pre-school is the stage where the speech and language service is concentrated. Whatever is available is concentrated in that area, which is not sufficient. It is patchy. The issue of speech therapy has been ongoing for a long time. The Government always had the power to do something but did not choose to do so.</P>
      <P>I met the father of the child in question. The seven year old boy is unable to speak because of the failure of the Department to provide speech and language therapy for him, despite his family highlighting the issue for the past two and a half years and the fact that the Western Care Association has recognised that the treatment is essential since the boy was three years of age. A special assessment was carried out before the boy started school and he was deemed suitable for national school. The aim of the last assessment was to assess his progress from infants to high infants on his ability to learn. He has this ability. During his earlier years he received a speech and language therapy service from the Western Care Association for one hour per week for four weeks. No service was provided for the next four weeks due to the scarcity of speech and language therapists. What a lousy service.</P>
      <P>His father was and is still very concerned for his son. He hears him speak and realises that he needs speech therapy if he is to have a chance to develop to his full potential as a person. When such children reach a certain age, no matter how bad they are, they will no longer receive a speech and language therapy service because of the scarcity of speech and language therapists. His father would like him to have speech therapy to <Col N="314"/>give him a chance to realise his full potential in order that he can be understood outside his close family. Currently that is not the case. He speaks too fast and if he is to be understood he will need training and speech and language therapy, which is not available.</P>
      <P>This boy was born in the United Kingdom and when he and his parents came to Ireland they found the services here completely different from those at home. They found one has to fight for everything in this country. The child's parents do not want him to be a forgotten person but they fear this will be the case. The father does not begrudge the Government its jet, spike or stadium; all he asks is that the Government gets its priorities right and ensures that his son gets a chance because it will be too late in a few years. He is told everything will be satisfactory in ten years' time but the window of opportunity will be closed by then.</P>
      <P>The Minister should act now to recruit speech and language therapists, from abroad if necessary. The lad in question deserves no less as a citizen of Ireland. He should be valued and allowed realise his maximum potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The way Deputy Cowley presented his case is a little unfair. To achieve a balance, I wish to address some of the broader issues and then deal with the specific issue. I thank the Deputy for raising it and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has allocated significant funds across the disability sector, which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of the health related services that are being provided to people with disabilities. In July 2003, additional revenue and capital funding totalling &euro;50 million was made available to services for people with disabilities. Included in this figure was additional revenue funding amounting to &euro;20 million in 2003, with a full-year cost in 2004 of &euro;30 million. A sum of &euro;15 million was made available for services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services, in particular for young adults who have just left school, and some enhancement of the health related support services for children. In addition, in December 2003, a further minor capital grant amounting to approximately &euro;10 million was allocated by my Department to the service providers in respect of services to people with intellectual disability or autism.</P>
      <P>The provision of the revenue funding, in particular for services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places. It will enable the service providers <Col N="315"/>to address key issues of concern that have been identified by the various representative groups.</P>
      <P>In the budget an additional &euro;18 million was allocated by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to my Department specifically for intellectual disability services. These moneys will be used to provide additional emergency placements and extra day services, especially for school leavers, and to enhance the health related support service for children. Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase.</P>
      <P>The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than those of previous generations, adding to the need for services. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to people with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places. Last year, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>
      <P>There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increases in speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the three year period to the end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increases in speech and language therapists. However, I recognise that there is still a shortfall.</P>
      <P>With regard to the details supplied by the Deputy. responsibility for the provision of services is a matter for the relevant health board. From inquiries made by my Department, I understand that the child concerned is being provided with the necessary therapies on a monthly basis.</P>

      <sTitle>Social Wefare Benefits.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter I wish to raise refers to a social welfare query I made earlier. I see that the Minister of State opposite is the Minister for everything tonight, from education to health to social welfare. I do not wish to be disrespectful, but I remind Ministers with responsibilities for particular areas that they should be present at the Adjournment debate when their areas of responsibility are under discussion.</P>
        <P>The individual whose case I wish to raise was, unfortunately, laid off work before Christmas, although he did not seek to be laid off. It was a great disappointment because obviously the finances suffer as a result. There are greater calls on the family finances at Christmas than at any other time.</P>
        <P>The man in question has a wife and three children. Given the nature of his previous employment, he was assessed as having means derived from this employment. This is bizarre because I believed we had addressed a long time ago in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is an issue I have taken up before, although it has raised its ugly head once again in that the man in question was deemed to be in receipt of part of the income he earned last year when determining his entitlement to a social welfare payment this year.</P>
        <P>I know money lasts for a long time if one looks after it and I am sure that there is a clear recognition of the needs of people in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but one must question why it is expected that a person who had an income in the year ending 31 December 2003 &mdash; it was October in the case of the man in question &mdash; could be deemed to still have benefit from that income in January 2004.</P>
        <P>This matter goes back to the poor law era, when people were deemed to be in good standing financially unless and until they were in penury. I can anticipate the Minister of State's reply and, <Col N="317"/>indeed, I could write it. Although he is genuine, diligent and anxious to pursue issues presented to him, there is no excuse for attempting to pretend that the individual in question has income derived from the income he spent last year. That income is gone, last year was lived, last year's summer holidays are gone, the roses of last year are gone and even the snow of last year is gone. Expecting the man to live on last year's income this year is daft. I will be taking up this issue again if it is not resolved satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State will state in his reply that the applicant was offered an option to appeal, which he was in a half-hearted way. This matter should not involve such an option. I also know deciding officers are involved. They must decide on the basis of the information available at the time but they make some peculiar decisions. I remind those who would say that the decisions are always correct of the decision made on equality payments in the 1980s &mdash; the issue would have cost 9 million to resolve in the beginning and 20 million a few years later but it eventually cost the State &euro;320 million.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o'clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine this genuine case. This man is honest and straightforward. He is not working and wants to work, but as soon as he finds employment he will be removed from the live register. The Minister should investigate the matter to ensure the nonsense applying at the moment does not continue and that his wife and three children receive the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the Deputy on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who is unavoidably absent on Government business. In response to Deputy Durkan's remark, I would not be the first to throw stones about making mistakes. We all do it, although we try not to. The Department of Social and Family Affairs and its officers have a difficult and challenging job in making decisions and usually get it right.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the termination of entitlement to unemployment assistance or any social welfare payment is not a function of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of an appeal, for appeals officers appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts. There is a statutory obligation on all claimants for an unemployment payment to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to the payment. For unemployment assistance, a claimant must satisfy a means test, be unemployed, capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
        <P>In the case referred to by Deputy Durkan, the person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 8 October 2003. His case was <Col N="318"/>investigated by a social welfare inspector on 23 October 2003. On receipt of documentation and information which had been requested by the inspector, a report and assessment were completed on 5 December 2003. The legislative provisions governing the assessment of means from self-employment for the purpose of unemployment assistance are contained in Part I of the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. Under these provisions, the income of a person, as outlined by Deputy Durkan, in the absence of other means of ascertaining it, is taken to be the income received during the year immediately preceding the date of calculation.</P>
        <P>I agree with some of the points raised by the Deputy, who was once Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right, and I challenged that view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>He had the opportunity to change the regulations.</P>

	<P>I did it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Where there is no other way to establish the likely income of a claimant in the coming year, the net earnings during the year preceding the date of the claim may be taken, provided the deciding officer is satisfied that similar opportunities for self-employment will arise in the coming year. It is a difficult call to make. In this case, however, the claimant was self-employed in construction and allied trades for a number of years. From information supplied by the claimant, his earnings for 2003 were calculated to be &euro;8,132.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The same as last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>This figure was used when deciding the claim. The inspector was satisfied that self-employment was likely to continue and on that basis he assessed weekly means as being &euro;156.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on last year's income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Notification of this decision and the right to appeal was issued to the claimant on 13 January. The claimant is currently being paid unemployment assistance at a weekly rate of &euro;118.60, which represents the full rate payable less means of &euro;156.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision of the deciding officer to the appeals office but he has not done so to date. It is my desire, and that of the Minister and others involved, that if the person wants to lodge an appeal and bring his case forward for a decision, <Col N="319"/>he should do so as quickly as possible. I am assuming that Deputy Durkan wishes the subject matter of this debate to be treated as an appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love that. I will go down myself to the appeal as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department will now arrange this. It will, however, be necessary for the <Col N="320"/>claimant to make known in writing the reasons or grounds for his appeal. Deputy Durkan will doubtless assist him with that. I assure the Deputy that the Department will be in contact with the claimant in the near future to process his appeal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 154, 165 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>Pressures on the hospital system, particularly in the eastern region, arise from demands on emergency departments and on difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. There are a number of initiatives under way to deal with these pressures.</P>
        <P>Planning for the discharge of patients by acute hospitals and the liaison with the community services has been prioritised on an ongoing basis by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Initiatives such as Homefirst, Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and home subvention are all contributing to providing alternative care packages for older people so that they can be discharged.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>The single most important factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A report called Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review, carried out by my Department, identified a requirement for an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospitals by 2011 and this requirement is reflected in the Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness- A Health System for You. Some 568 of the 709 beds in the first phase have been commissioned to date, of which 253 are in the eastern region. Revenue funding of approximately &euro;40 million has already been made available to the ERHA for these beds. Funding is available to enable the balance of the 709 beds to be brought into operation this year. Also under the acute bed capacity initiative, I have provided an additional &euro;12.6 million to the ERHA, &euro;8.8 million, and to the Southern Health Board, &euro;3.8 million, to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting thereby freeing up acute beds. It allows for funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community. Already this funding has resulted in the discharge of a total of 223 patients from acute hospitals in the eastern region. The ERHA is actively monitoring the situation and working with hospitals and the area health boards to ensure that every effort is being made to minimise the number of delayed discharges in acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the ERHA that it is working closely with the major acute hospitals in Dublin with a view to re-opening beds which have been closed due to staffing difficulties. As part of the winter initiative, an additional 20 accident and emergency consultants have been appointed from the 29 approved. Additional appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA.</P>
        <P>Reviews of the bed management function and nurse staffing levels in emergency departments are being progressed by the Health Services Employers Agency in consultation with health service management representatives and the nursing unions.</P>
        <P>Emergency medicine departments may sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions which are more appropriate to a primary care setting. General practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives have been established and are operating in at least part of all the health board areas, with one health board, the North Eastern Health Board, having a region-wide project. A total of &euro;46.5 million has been allocated for the development of out-of-hours co-operatives between 1997 and 2003.</P>
        <P>A media campaign has been undertaken on radio, television, and in the newspapers highlighting the pressures that exist in emergency <Col N="323"/>medicine departments and encouraging people to attend only if absolutely necessary. This initiative is an attempt to focus on the need for only those in need of emergency care to attend and for others to use the primary care services.</P>
        <P>I will continue to work with the various health agencies in looking for short-term and longer term solutions to the current difficulties.</P>

	<P>Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al recently published the report of a committee to review neurology and neurophysiology services and I am happy to endorse its recommendations for a significant enhancement of services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multidisciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications will, in my view, offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and with the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association in relation to the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the report of the national task force on medical staffing.</P>
        <P>Specialty costing data in respect of hospitals which provide neurology services indicate that in-patient costs for this specialty for 2002 were more than &euro;19 million. This figure excludes costs in respect of neurology services provided in out-patient and accident and emergency departments <Col N="324"/>and specialist day case activity which are not routinely collected by my Department.</P>

	<P>Screening in respect of specific infectious diseases has been offered to asylum seekers on a voluntary and confidential basis, free of charge, shortly after their arrival in this country since May 2000. The purpose of screening is to detect and treat certain infectious diseases in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves and their families as well as the community in general.</P>
        <P>Initial screening usually takes place in Dublin where asylum seekers may reside following arrival in this country and continues when they are relocated to other health board regions. Those who do not receive screening in Dublin are offered this service following relocation. The guidelines in relation to infectious disease screening recommend screening is provided for the following: TB, hepatitis B, and where appropriate for polio and varicella zoster. HIV testing is also offered.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the percentage uptake of health screening by asylum seekers in the year 2003.</P>

	<P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, calls for the development of a policy for men's health and health promotion. The National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 also identified the development of a national plan for men's health as an important initiative. In this regard, the health promotion unit of my Department has supported the appointment of a men's health research officer in the South Eastern Health Board. His remit is to research the role of gender and masculinity on men's concept of health, their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes to health and illness, health behaviours and risk behaviours and the barriers that men perceive in accessing the health services.</P>
        <P>The health promotion unit have also commenced a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders, including the men's health forum, for the development of the men's health policy. The outcome of this consultation process and the findings of the research will inform the development of the policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>From 1 February personal injury claims against hospital consultants arising from the delivery of clinical care will be covered by the clinical indemnity scheme, CIS. This move will bring consultants into line with other health service staff and their employers who have been covered by the scheme since its inception on 1 July 2002. <Col N="327"/>In the intervening months extensive negotiations have taken place with the organisations representing consultants in an effort to have them covered by the scheme with their agreement. Virtually all of their concerns about the scheme have been dealt with to their satisfaction. Two issues have remained unresolved. These are the likely cost of purchasing professional indemnity cover for private practice not covered by the clinical indemnity scheme and the question of who should cover claims arising from past events.</P>
        <P>The new scheme delivers significant benefits to the vast majority of consultants. For those employed in public hospitals it means that all of their practice in the public hospital, including their private practice, is covered by the CIS at no cost to them. This is a benefit not conferred on consultants in the UK under similar schemes put in place there. Private practice conducted outside of public hospitals is not covered by the scheme. However, the Government, in recognition of the complementary roles of the public and private health care sectors in Ireland, has indicated that the State will bear the cost of individual claims against consultants in private practice to the extent that they exceed &euro;1 million in respect of any single claim. In the case of obstetric claims the limit of indemnity which consultants will need to purchase will be &euro;500,000. The effect of these measures is to reduce the cost of indemnity cover for consultants' private practice by between 25% and 30% of what it would otherwise be. This benefit is available to consultants working in the public system who have some off-site private practice as well as to those who work full-time in private practice. From indicative rates circulated by one of the two medical defence bodies operating in Ireland it is clear that the vast majority of consultants, including those in the private sector, will pay lower rates for their indemnity cover after 1 February.</P>
        <P>When the Government decided in December 1999 to introduce the CIS, based on the principle of enterprise liability, it also decided that the new scheme would not have any retrospective effect. The reason for that decision was that hospitals and doctors had already paid insurance premiums and subscriptions for claims arising from events which had occurred before the scheme's inception. Either directly or indirectly, the Exchequer had paid for this cover. The Government saw no reason the State should take over liabilities for which it had already paid. This position has been accepted by all of the commercial insurance companies which had insured health boards and hospitals up to 1 July 2002. It has also been accepted by the Medical Protection Society. The only indemnifier disputing the correctness of the Government's position is the Medical Defence Union, MDU. The MDU believes that the State has some responsibility for liabilities which arise from past events. The Government rejects this position and <Col N="328"/>is insisting that the MDU meets it obligations to its Irish members. The threat by the MDU to leave some of its members without assistance in meeting the cost of claims has put many doctors under great stress. The Government has given a commitment to its representatives that it is prepared, if the need arises, to fund the cost of legal action against the MDU to ensure that it meets its obligations to its Irish members. I believe that it is in the interests of Irish doctors and Irish taxpayers that the MDU is persuaded to take responsibility for its own liabilities like everybody else.</P>
        <P>Particular concern has been expressed about the ability of consultant obstetricians who work in the private sector to buy professional indemnity cover at reasonable cost. I have to point out that the cost of this cover has nothing to do with the establishment of the CIS. The particular difficulties of this specialty have been recognised for some time. In response the Government established a group in 2002 to examine the feasibility of introducing &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation for infants who suffer cerebral damage at birth. The group is expected to produce its report in the middle of this year. In the meantime the Government has put measures in place which, in effect, subsidise the cost of insurance cover for the two hospitals which deliver obstetric services and for the consultants who practice in them. As a result of the Government's initiative, consultant obstetricians in private practice will pay &euro;100,000 or less for cover rather than the full economic cost of &euro;350,000. These measures ensure that Mount Carmel Hospital in Dublin and the Bon Secour Hospital in Cork can continue to provide these services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 159, 167 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to implementing the Hanly report. It will mean a much better service for patients, with considerably more consultants, working in teams. The report also involves reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, which will benefit both patients and doctors. In addition, Hanly proposes a reorganisation of our acute hospital services so that patients receive the best possible treatment in the location most appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>We have begun the process of implementing the Hanly report. My Department, together with health employers, has initiated discussions with the medical organisations on a new contract for consultants which would enable a consultant-provided service to be established nationally. This is a key element of the Hanly agenda.</P>
        <P>I am also moving to implement the report's recommendations on the reorganisation of acute hospital services. The Hanly report examined the organisation of hospital services in two regions, those covered by East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board. I will shortly be announcing details of implementation groups in these areas. Each group will focus on the detailed provision of acute hospital services in future in line with Hanly.</P>
        <P>The report also proposed that the organisation of acute hospital services in the rest of the country should be examined. Today I announced the composition of an acute hospitals review group, to be chaired by David Hanly, for this purpose. It will be asked to prepare a national hospitals plan for the interim health services executive, building on the principles of the Hanly report. The group will be asked to examine the role and structure of acute hospital services on a national basis.</P>
        <P>Under the European working time directive, we must reduce the average weekly working hours of junior doctors to no more than 58 by 1 August. My Department is working closely with the Health Service Employers Agency and other health agencies to bring this about. Negotiations have commenced on the issue with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
        <P>Finally, in relation to medical education and training, I have asked the group that worked originally as part of the national task force on medical staffing to remain in place to complete consideration of issues relating to postgraduate medical education and training. This will be of particular concern in the context of a 48-hour working week which must be in place by August 2009. The group's final report is expected later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children who cannot, for a number of reasons, be looked after in their own home. There are now approximately 4,000 children and young people under 18 years of age in the care of approximately 3,146 foster carers. Health boards continually recruit foster carers to meet demands for placements and to replace foster carers who cease fostering.</P>
        <P>There are more than 91 children in residential care awaiting a foster care placement. The health boards are actively working towards providing appropriate foster care placements for these children. In 2003, the total funding spent by the health boards in the provision of financial support to foster carers was approximately &euro;66.83 million. In 2001, the working group report on foster care was published. The report contains a wide range of recommendations designed to ensure that the structures and services necessary to meet the needs of children in foster care, their families and foster carers be strengthened and further developed. The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>This report noted that the foster care allowance was not adequate to meet the needs of children in foster care and it recommended that the allowance be increased, alleviating the need for foster parents to apply to health boards for every extra financial need of their foster children. Before August 2001, the allowance was &euro;90.85 per week for a child under 12 years and &euro;108.88 per week for a child of 12 years and over. In line with the report the allowance was increased substantially and the current rates of payment are &euro;289.50 and &euro;316.50 per week, respectively.</P>
        <P>Another important recommendation of the working group report was the development of national standards incorporating planning and key performance indicators for the foster care service. A committee was set up in 2001 to formulate these standards, taking into account the representative views of all bodies and individuals involved in foster care, including the children themselves. The national standards for foster care, along with a children's version, were launched in April 2003. The standards will serve as a basis for consistently promoting quality of care in the foster care services.</P>
        <P>The standards include good practice procedures relating to the recruitment and retention, support and training of foster carers. I am confident that the standards will significantly improve the quality of our foster care services <Col N="331"/>and encourage new foster care applicants. It should also be noted that, in parallel with these developments, the health boards undertake local initiatives on an ongoing basis to recruit foster carers. These initiatives include prominents displays of promotional materials, advertisements in local media and sponsorship of events organised in conjunction with the Irish Foster Care Association.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, foster care placements may not always meet the specific needs of individual children. A broad spectrum of services are required, therefore, to meet the needs of the children in our care, for example, family support services, foster care placements, residential placements and youth advocacy programmes.</P>

	<P>My Department routinely collects information on beds not in use in acute hospitals from health agencies on a quarterly basis. The most recent complete figures available to my Department relate to the first six months of 2003. This data shows that 50,584 bed days were lost in the period, which is equivalent to a daily average of 278 beds out of use representing just more than 2% of the available acute bed stock. The total bed days lost in 2002 as a result of closures is equivalent to a daily average of 269 beds being closed which represents 2% of the overall available capacity. The equivalent percentage for 2001 was also 2%.</P>
        <P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures fluctuate over time and may arise for a variety of reasons such as ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures. Some hospitals, particularly in the Dublin region, temporarily closed some beds during 2003 due to budgetary difficulties and the application of the accountability legislation of 1998. These closures were in addition to the normal seasonal closures that take place in hospitals around the country during holiday periods.</P>
        <P>According to the Eastern Regional Health Authority there are 89 beds closed in the major acute hospitals in Dublin and a small number of beds are also closed for refurbishment within the eastern region. There are also a number of non-acute beds closed partly due to staff shortages. I understand that the ERHA is working closely <Col N="332"/>with hospitals to recruit and retain more nurses so that closed beds can be re-opened.</P>
        <P>The figures for the final six months of 2003 are being collected by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, compiles the general mortality register's official statistics on direct drug-related deaths each year. The figures on direct opiate related deaths in Dublin from 1997 to 2000 are as follows: 
1997, 
50; 
1998, 
50; 
1999, 
70; 
2000, 
63.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Department of Transport that road accident fatalities in Dublin from 1999 to 2002 is as follows: 1999, 57; 2000, 69; 2001, 63; 2002, 49. 	The breakdown of figures for 2003 is not yet available.</P>
        <P>At present, drug related deaths are recorded by the general mortality register of the CSO, based on the international classification of diseases, ICD, code system. Other countries have developed dedicated systems for recording drug related deaths and it is important, for the purposes of comparative analysis, that the Irish system is capable of generating an equivalent level of information. It is for this reason that one of the actions contained in the national drugs strategy calls for the development of an accurate mechanism for recording the number of drug related deaths. Overall responsibility for this action rests with the coroner's service and the Central Statistics Office. Work has commenced on progressing this action and my Department is continuing to co-operate with the relevant agencies to establish a mechanism to record accurately the position in relation to drug related deaths.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 is to reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research with the ultimate aim of leading a drug-free lifestyle. The health related aspects of the national drugs strategy focus in particular on education and prevention and treatment and rehabilitation, including substitution treatment under the methadone protocol.</P>
        <Miles com="cl" par="115" />
        <P>The number of methadone treatment places has expanded considerably in recent years in line with the Government's commitment under the national drugs strategy. At the end of December <Col N="333"/>2003 there were 7,029 people receiving methadone treatment. This compares with a figure of just more than 5,000 at the end of 2000. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority there are 59 drug treatment locations. This compares with 12 locations in 1997. Outside the ERHA, treatment clinics have been established in the South Eastern Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, Western Health Board and Midland Health Board. General practitioners and pharmacists also provide treatment services and their involvement has also increased in recent years. The boards aim to address substance misuse by providing effective and sustainable services working in partnership with clients and with fellow service providers. All clients entering the addiction services are assessed and appropriate treatment plans are identified based on client needs. Decisions concerning the appropriate treatment for patients are made in accordance with best practice guidelines.</P>
        <P>Overdose prevention is an inherent part of the comprehensive range of services which the boards provide, including education and prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, counselling and harm reduction. International evidence supports the view that opiate users are safer in treatment. Therefore every effort is made to encourage clients to engage in treatment. Outreach workers are provided by the three area health boards of the ERHA and they have a significant role in providing education to opiate misusers who are not currently in treatment on the dangers of overdose.</P>
        <P>The national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, has recently published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland. The study estimates that 14,452 people were using heroin in 2001. Of these 12,456 were in the Dublin area. This represents a decrease on a 1996 figure, which estimated that 13,461 people were using heroin in the Greater Dublin area.</P>

        <Quest>his response to the hospital waiting lists published in December 2003; if he accepts that the latest list shows virtually no improvement over the previous lists; the steps he intends to take to reduce the numbers on the lists and the waiting periods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the waiting list initiative, the Comptroller and Auditor General notes that the existence of a waiting list does not, in itself, <Col N="334"/>indicate that a problem exists within the system. The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on to say that achieving optimum efficiency in the provision of public services may inevitably result in the creation of waiting lists.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are two streams to hospital activity &mdash; emergency and elective activity. Pressures on the hospital system due to identified capacity constraints hinder its ability to provide elective activity in a planned way because of the urgent and unpredictable needs of emergency patients. This is a complex area and compounded by difficulties relating to the availability of long stay beds and other supports in the community. Patients who require elective treatment may have to wait because beds, staff and operating theatres are being used to treat emergency cases. The balance to be achieved is to ensure that the available resources are used efficiently and that treatment can be delivered to patients in a reasonable time.</P>
        <P>The waiting list data for the period ended 30 September 2003 showed that there were significant reductions in the number of adults and children waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties has fallen by approximately 42% in the period September 2002 to September 2003. The total number of children waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment in the same specialties and for the same period has decreased by approximately 39%.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in many health board areas to achieve the target of no adult waiting longer than 12 months and no child waiting longer than six months. This has been achieved through active management of long waiting lists at a local level and the involvement of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. Up to the end of December 2003, more than 9,700 patients had already received treatments through the NTPF, predominantly in private hospitals in Ireland. All health boards outside of the eastern region are reporting that, in general, those adults reported to be waiting more than 12 months and those children reported to be waiting more than six months have either been offered treatment under the NTPF or have conditions that are complicated and need to be treated locally.</P>
        <P>While the rate of progress in achieving the targets set out in the health strategy has been slower than anticipated, the targets still remain a goal to be achieved and I will continue to keep the focus on reducing waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

	<P>An independent investigation team established by the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board has submitted a detailed report into the circumstances of the death of a patient from Legionnnaire's disease at Waterford Regional Hospital in April 2003.</P>
        <P>The report sets out a number of key recommendations and the South Eastern Health Board has taken the following steps. It has carried out remedial work on the existing water distribution system in Waterford Regional Hospital; installed chlorine dioxide treatment in the water system; established an environmental monitoring committee in Waterford Regional Hospital with a proposal to establish a similar committee in each acute hospital in the region; and recruited an environmental monitoring officer.</P>
        <P>At a national level, it is important to ensure that the findings and recommendations of the report will contribute to the development of improved protocols and procedures in relation to Legionnaire's disease.

	<P>As part of the implementation of the Hanly report and the wider health reform programme, my Department and health service employers have had preliminary discussions with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in relation to arrangement for the negotiation of a new consultants' contract.</P>
        <P>The management team met with the IMO and IHCA in December 2003 to discuss the selection of an independent chairman, the setting of an agenda, and the agreement of a timeframe for forthcoming substantive negotiations. It was intended that negotiations would get under way in February 2004. However, notification has been received from the IHCA that, due to my decision to proceed with the introduction of the new clinical indemnity scheme, it is not in a position to send a delegation to negotiations on a new contract. I regret this decision and I take this opportunity to invite the IHCA to proceed with these important negotiations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the national task force on medical staffing, Hanly report, recommends that the re-configuration of our acute hospital services and compliance with the terms of the European working time directive, EWTD, will require changes in consultant work practices and the associated creation of a large number of additional consultant posts. This will increase the availability of senior clinical decision-makers in line with the reduction of the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, to 48 hours a week by 2009. Delays encountered in the negotiation of the consultants' contract may have some affect on <Col N="337"/>the pace of progress on the implementation of the European working time directive. I am pressing, therefore, for negotiations on a new consultants' contract to commence as soon as possible. However, implementation of other task force recommendations can and must proceed alongside contractual negotiations. These include a study of the structure and organisation of acute hospital services nationally, national discussions on measures to reduce NCHD hours in the context of the task force's recommendations, actions throughout the country to meet the requirements of the EWTD and developing ways of speeding up the recruitment process, particularly for consultants.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to putting in place a consultant-provided service, harnessing the contribution of all our hospitals; and providing a wider range of appropriate services and procedures in local hospitals.</P>

	<P>A report commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace was published in January 2003. This report was prepared by an independent scientific working group.</P>
        <P>The conclusions of the expert group are quite blunt on the risks to health from environmental tobacco smoke. Environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of cancer, heart disease and respiratory problems. Employees need to be protected from exposure at work. Current ventilation technology is ineffective at removing the risk to health. Legislative measures are required to protect workers from the adverse effects of exposure.</P>
        <P>A draft of regulations to prohibit smoking in the workplace was notified to the commission in April 2003, and during the three month standstill period which allows member states to voice opinions on the measure, no objections or reservations were put forward. The commission was notified of two amendments to the draft regulations in November 2003 to allow for exemptions for prisons and outdoor work areas <Col N="338"/>and for psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, certain charitable institutions and sleeping accommodation in hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfasts. Because of these amendments it was necessary to change the commencement date for the introduction of the ban. The standstill period for the amendments notified will end on 4 February and 16 February 2004.</P>
        <P>Surveys carried out by the Office of Tobacco Control show widespread support for smoke-free workplaces and the trade union movement are strongly in favour of the measure. The owner, manager or person in charge of a workplace is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements, including the prohibition on smoking in the workplace. As part of the process of monitoring compliance with the smoke-free workplace requirement, authorised officers from health boards and the Office of Tobacco Control will visit premises. I expect that the vast majority of employers, employees and the public will respect the new measures which are primarily to protect people from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. I will make a decision on the new date for commencement of the smoke-free workplaces regulations in the near future.</P>

        <P>The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of the Government for some time. A number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years, some with the specific intention of retaining existing staff and encouraging nursing staff who have left the profession to return to employment. These include an increase of 70% in the number of nursing training places from 968 in 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards; payment of fees to nurses and midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; an improved scheme of financial support for student paediatric nurses and student midwives; the payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses and midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; the abolition of fees for &ldquo;back to practice&rdquo; <Col N="339"/>courses and payment of salary to nurses and midwives undertaking such courses; financial support to State enrolled nurses, SEN, working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom; 40 sponsorships being made available <Col N="340"/>each year for certain categories of health service employees wishing to train as nurses; and the introduction of flexible working options.</P>

        <P>In relation to attrition, the same survey found that, in the year ending 30 September 2003, the number of nurses who resigned or retired was <Col N="340"/>2,937. During the same period, the number of nurses recruited was 4,084. Therefore the excess of recruits over retirements and resignations was 1,147. This clearly demonstrates that the level of recruitment activity is well ahead of losses through retirements and resignations. The figure of 33,395 whole-time equivalents translates into 39,119 individual nurses. Of these, some 28,366 work full-time, and 10,753 work job-sharing or other atypical patterns. Thus, more than one quarter of the nursing workforce avail of family-friendly work patterns. Figures from An Bord Altranais indicate that there is a steady stream of new entrants into the profession. The table below illustrates the number of applications for registration between 1998 and November 2003:</P><Col N="339"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 175 and 192 together.</P>
        <P>The Government's decision on the health service reform programme is based on the recommendations of the following key reports: the audit of structures and functions in the health system from the Prospectus report; the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service from the Brennan report; and the report of the national task force on medical staffing in the Hanly report.</P>
        <P>The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. Phase one of the implementation of the reform programme involved a widespread communications and consultation process and the establishment of 13 action projects to think through and flesh out specific aspects of the programme. The action projects concluded as planned at the end of December. A composite document outlining the main findings is being finalised. Phase two of the reform programme is focused on transition to the new structures. It has commenced at this stage.</P>
        <P>Last November I announced the establishment of the board of the interim health service executive and it held its first meeting earlier this month. The interim HSE will be responsible for: recommending the senior management structure for the new executive; recommending regional boundaries and location of regional headquarters for primary, community and continuing care services and appropriate management structures for consideration by the Government; and, within approved parameters, the selection and appointment of a chief executive officer to the HSE and subsequent appointments at senior management level.</P>
        <P>The work to be undertaken by the interim HSE is one of four distinct but interrelated strands of activity that will take place under the reform programme during 2004. The other three strands are: the legislative, mainstreaming, human resource and industrial relations aspects of the reform programme for which my Department will continue to have lead responsibility; the work of the acute hospitals review group chaired by Mr. David Hanly; and the ongoing management of the health system and internal preparations for the new organisation and governance <Col N="343"/>arrangements being led by the CEOs of health board and the health boards executive.</P>
        <P>The Government has also appointed a national steering committee to oversee the implementation of the work programmes of the four strands. It will provide a co-ordinating forum for actions being led in the respective strands and will ensure overall consistency with the Government's decision. It will report on a regular basis to the Cabinet committee on health strategy, ensuring that the Government is kept informed on all important issues.</P>
        <P>The respective roles of the HSE's CEO and board will be made explicit in the legislation to be introduced. I will also continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of my role and responsibilities and the relevant Oireachtas committees. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Committee of Public Accounts will continue to exercise their respective roles.</P>
        <P>Regional authorities will not be part of the new structure. I have indicated that I will bring forward proposals for the involvement of public representatives at local level. I shall build on the ideas already outlined for consultation at regional level. Proposals are being prepared in my Department and I have indicated my intention to discuss the matter with the Association of Health Boards at a meeting in the near future.</P>

        <asker>Mr. S. Ryan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed in the United Kingdom about the spread of hepatitis C where it is estimated that up to 200,000 people may be infected, with many unaware that they are carrying the virus; the plans he has for a programme to identify and treat patients here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1906/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the figure of 200,000 persons in the UK is probably derived from an estimated national prevalence rate of 0.4% in the population of 60 million.</P>
        <P>The prevalence of HCV infection in the general population in Ireland is probably quite low, lying somewhere between 0.03% and 1.4%. Some high risk groups, such as intravenous drug users, have extremely high rates of up to 81% to 92% prevalence. The risk of acquiring hepatitis C increases with the length of an injecting career. A survey of short-term injectors showed 52% anti-HCV positive. Other groups with increased risk include homeless people at 18% and sex workers at 8%. About 1,600 people are infected within the State by blood and blood products.</P>
        <P>Under an amendment to the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 introduced on 1 January, hepatitis C is now a notifiable disease. In addition, laboratory directors are now also <Col N="344"/>required to report infectious diseases. These changes should enhance the information available in Ireland on the epidemiology of hepatitis C by improving the comprehensiveness and quality of notified data.</P>
        <P>I understand from the ERHA that drug treatment centres in the region have a policy of offering testing for HIV and hepatitis A, B and C to patients who present for treatment of their addiction. The drug treatment centres' policy of viral screening, including hepatitis, forms part of the general medical assessment for those entering treatment. It has contributed significantly to the ongoing education of this high risk group in terms of prevention and early treatment intervention.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that, in 1994, the drug treatment centre board established a dedicated hepatitis C clinic on a sessional basis and these services were extended in 2000. Attendances at the clinic have risen from 960 in 2000 to approximately 1,387 in 2002. The dedicated clinic offers assessment, testing, education and support to persons with hepatitis C and, where appropriate, referral to a hospital setting for treatment. The service was augmented in 2003 by the establishment of a pilot programme for the treatment of hepatitis C patients within a drug treatment setting. The early indications suggest that treatment outcomes are comparable to hospital based treatment settings.</P>
        <P>Recently I launched an information booklet, hepatitis C &mdash; Guide for Drug Users and their Families, which was published by the DTCB. The booklet provides a comprehensive easy to read guide for individuals and families affected by hepatitis C. It will also be of value to general practitioners and other professionals working in the area of substance misuse and its associated health risks.</P>
        <P>The recipient tracing unit of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has operated a tracing programme since 1994 to identify recipients of infectious or potentially infectious blood or blood products. Persons identified as having been infected by blood or blood products administered within the State are provided with a Health (Amendment) Act card. It entitles them to a range of free health services. A number of publications have also been developed for this cohort. I have no plans to carry out hepatitis C screening in the general population in view of the low prevalence of the disease.</P>

	<P>My Department has not estimated the cost of extending medical card coverage to children under 15 years of age. The health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for it and to give priority to families with children, especially children with a disability. This measure should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year due to the prevailing budgetary situation. However, the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime and the matter will be kept under review</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. I understand from my Department that, for the purposes of determining eligibility, the income of a cohabiting couple is treated in the same way as the income of a married couple by health boards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 203 together.</P>
        <P>The Sl&aacute;n survey published in 2003 highlights that 47% of the Irish population were overweight or obese in 2002, compared with 42% in 1998. In the same period, the reported rates of those overweight have increased from 32% to 34% and obese from 10% to 13%. In addition to this, numbers reporting no physical activity have increased among both men &mdash; from 21% to 30% &mdash; and women &mdash; from 20% to 25%.</P>
        <P>The issue of childhood obesity is a challenge that is being addressed. Significant cultural <Col N="348"/>changes have impacted in that opportunities to participate in physical activity have decreased while the prevalence of foods high in fat and sugar have increased in children's diets. Data from a recent study compiled from the health behaviour in school children survey indicate that 20% to 21% of boys and girls are overweight in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The results of these surveys reflect a similar situation at global level. Developed countries are documenting increasing levels of overweight and obesity. A position paper prepared by the international obesity task force recommends that national obesity task forces be established to develop and implement strategies to counteract the epidemic of obesity.</P>
        <P>In response to these trends and in line with the EU Health Council conclusions that member states need to address the issue of obesity using established national structures, I am in the process of establishing an obesity task force.</P>
        <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in health promotion activities associated with obesity prevention. These will have a long-term impact in addressing this issue. National campaigns support the implementation of these strategies, the aims of which are to raise awareness of healthy diets and being active for health and for weight management. The campaign &ldquo;Let it Go &mdash; just for 30 minutes&rdquo; focused on the message that even minor increases in the level of activity can lead to positive health benefits. The national healthy eating campaign has concentrated on encouraging people to eat four or more portions of fruit or vegetables per day. As part of these campaigns health boards provide regional and local focus in schools, communities and other settings.</P>
        <P>As a direct result of funding from the cardiovascular health strategy there are now 36 additional community dieticians in post. These dieticians have formed partnerships with community groups to provide nutrition education, cookery programmes and healthy eating projects. The majority of boards have been resourced to run specific targeted, focused, sustained programmes aimed in particular at those on low income. Physical activity co-ordinators have also been appointed in each board, promoting physical activity amongst the population as recommended in the national strategies.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been carried out by Professor Eamon O'Shea, National University of Ireland, Galway. The review was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance following on from a Government decision in 1999. The O'Shea report was formally launched on 25 June 2003 at a joint press conference with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. She launched the Mercer report on the future financing of long-<Col N="350"/>term care in Ireland at the joint press conference. Following on from the publication of the O'Shea and Mercer reports, it was agreed that a working group should be established by my Department to review the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the inaugural meeting of the working group took place in early December. One of the items for discussion by the working group at its first meeting was to agree terms of reference for the review.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared with those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of <Col N="351"/>international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>The forum also concluded the following: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; dental fluorosis &mdash; a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel &mdash; is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation.</P>
        <P>The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of sub-groups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward its views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. In adopting a participatory and evidence based approach, the forum strove to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the forum report members of the forum made presentations countrywide to various civic groups and bodies, including the Irish Society of Toxicology and the Institute of Engineers of Ireland. Many issues raised by Dr. Connett were covered in the forum report. It was not considered appropriate to respond comprehensively to all of Dr. Connett's questions in the forum report. A more comprehensive response to all his questions will be published in the coming months.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its term of office.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards <Col N="353"/>when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the CEO of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment <Col N="354"/>scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
        <P>The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF, which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
        <P>The medical card income guidelines issued by the chief executive officers of the health boards for 2004 are as follows:</P><Col N="353"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Studies conducted in several developed countries have established beyond question that medical error is a serious issue. These studies suggest that anywhere between 4% and 12% of patients may suffer an adverse event while in hospital. Some caution needs to be exercised in interpreting data from these studies as the definitions and the methodologies used vary. There are no comparable data for Irish hospitals because no such study has been carried out here. The figure of 14,000 possible deaths and injuries used in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme transmitted in December is produced from an extrapolation of the findings of the landmark Harvard medical malpractice study to Irish hospitals. I have made <Col N="355"/>the point that the Harvard study data indicate that medical error is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>All of the studies undertaken on medical error suggest that many of these errors are preventable and could be avoided through good risk management. The Government has put significant resources into clinical risk management over the past three years. In that time in excess of &euro;10 million has been allocated to health boards and hospitals under this heading. Several health boards have developed and implemented clinical risk management strategies. Most acute hospitals have appointed at least one clinical risk manager. Risk management has also been established as a key component of the clinical indemnity scheme. All agencies covered by the scheme are in the course of being supplied with a state of the art IT system which will allow them to report and analyse adverse events and claims. Ireland is the first country to have put such a system in place on a national basis. I expect that it will make a major contribution to enhancing patient safety in Irish hospitals. Officials of my Department are discussing with the health research board how the data generated by the system might be used in appropriate research projects.</P>
        <P>The Medical Practitioners Act 1978 established the Medical Council as the body responsible for the registration and regulation of the activities of medical practitioners. In point 5 of its document Medical Council Statement of Core Policies 2000, the council makes adequate indemnity insurance a clear requirements for those registered. Where doctors working in a private capacity are concerned, patients are advised to take additional care to satisfy themselves that a doctor has satisfactory cover in place at the time that they are treated.</P>
        <P>Draft legislative proposals providing for further, wide-ranging amendments to the 1978 Act are in the final stages of preparation in my Department following extensive consultation, and draft heads of a Bill are due to be brought to Cabinet in the very near future. One of the primary concerns of the amending legislation will be to provide for increased public protection.</P>

	<P>My Department's modernisation action plan was drawn up and submitted in accordance with the terms laid down by the Civil Service performance verification group, CSPVG. These arrangements are in line with those for all other Departments. The action plan was accepted by the CSPVG. The first progress report was required by 24 October 2003 and was duly submitted with additional material as requested.</P>
        <P>The CSPVG has assessed the progress achieved on the commitments made by my Department and agreed by the partnership committee. The assessment was made having regard to the progress report submitted, additional material requested by the CSPVG and the report made by the Secretary General on public service management and development in the Department of Finance on progress achieved across the Civil Service as a whole. Copies of all this material will shortly be made available on the website of the Department of Finance in conjunction with the progress reports of all other Departments. On the basis of this assessment, the CSPVG has decided that the progress achieved warrants payment of the pay increases due from 1 January 2004 for all grades of staff in my Department.</P>
        <P>Under Sustaining Progress, the assessment of verified progress for the health sector is the responsibility of the Secretary General of my Department. Following consideration of the findings of the health service performance verification group, the Secretary General has decided that payment of the increases to all staff in the health service covered by the public service benchmarking body's pay recommendations, with effect from 1 January 2004, is warranted.</P>
        <P>This decision was based on strong evidence of willingness within the health sector to co-operate with modernisation and change under each of the headings set out in Sustaining Progress.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the funding of services at the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. Under an agreement involving the ERHA, the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and St. James's Hospital, paediatric haematology and <Col N="357"/>haemophilia services were transferred from the National Children's Hospital to Crumlin. As part of the agreement, the ERHA agreed to fund three new consultant paediatrician posts at the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, in addition to its advisory role, is the statutory body whose main executive function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts. On the three new consultant posts, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al has recommended that a paediatric consultant with a special interest in endocrinology be approved as a joint appointment with Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. My Department is advised that Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al is in negotiations with the two hospitals and the ERHA with regard to the sessional split attaching to this post.</P>
        <P>I understand that the other two consultant paediatricians, one with a special interest in respiratory medicine, the other with a special interest in community child health, have been approved by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al. The latter post is to be shared with the South Western Area Health Board. The filling of these posts is now a matter for the hospital. I wish to confirm for the Deputy that the necessary funding for these posts is in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, the most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland, 1994 to 1998: Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, finds that rates of prostate cancer in men in all age groups showed statistically significant increases. However, mortality rates showed no evidence of an upward or downward time trend. The report states that the evidence of a divergence between incidence and mortality rates may be due to better case-finding, more incidental diagnoses or a genuine increase in survival. The report further states that the increase in incidence rates in men under 65 years of age appears to be a recent phenomenon and that it is notable how little mortality rates have changed over this same period of time. The report concludes that it is unclear from the figures if mortality trends will change much in the future but considers that it is unlikely that incidence rates will continue their steady climb.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy <Col N="358"/>identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The National Cancer Strategy 2004 is currently being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has been established on generic screening. This multidisciplinary group has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. On screening for prostate cancer in particular, the group recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate screening programme in this country. The group recommended that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy of European Commission recommendations on cancer screening which were accepted by the Council last December. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>The new national cancer strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. It will also make recommendations on the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>

        <P>The ERHA proposes to develop nine 50-bed CNUs, three in each of the area health boards in the following locations: Clonskeagh Hospital, Newcastle Hospital, County Wicklow, and Tivoli Road, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, in the East Coast Area Health Board; St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, and Swords in the Northern Area Health Board; St. Brigid's Hospital, Crooksling, Br&uacute; Chaoimh&iacute;n, Cork Street, and Cherry Orchard Hospital in the South Western Area Health Board. It is intended that 20 to 25 day care places will be provided in each location if the site is conducive to accommodating the service.</P><Col N="359"/>
        <P>The Southern Health Board proposes to develop eight 50-bed CNUs in the following locations; St. Finbarr's Hospital, Farranlea Road, and Ballincollig in the Cork south Lee area; St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire, and St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranabraher, in the Cork north Lee area; Mount Alvernia Hospital, Mallow, in the north Cork area; Bantry in the west Cork area and Ballyard, Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
        <P>These additional beds are currently not available because the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board/authority to comply with the EU procurement legislation and national guidelines on PPPs.</P>
        <P>A draft public sector benchmark, which is a comprehensive and detailed risk adjusted costing of the project elements using conventional procurement over the whole life of the project, have been prepared by the ERHA and the SHB. The draft public sector benchmarks have been submitted to my Department and are currently under consideration. The next step will be to seek Department of Finance approval for the projects and on approval contract notices will be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>

	<P>As I have stated previously in response to a similar question, a draft copy of the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultancy review of governance and accountability mechanisms in the GMS schemes was received by my Department in February <Col N="360"/>2003. While the review was being considered by officials in my Department, both the Brennan and Prospectus reports were published. Since the contents and recommendations of both of these reports are relevant to the subject matter of the GMS review, my Department requested Deloitte and Touche to update the draft in this light, and also having regard to the latest financial data from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. The final draft of this review has now been received by my Department. It is my intention to bring this review to Government as soon as possible, at which time its publication and implementation will be discussed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197, 771, 772 and 782 together.</P>
        <P>On foot of the report, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011. Commissioning of the first phase of this development, an additional 709 acute hospital beds for public patients began in 2002. Some 568 of these beds have now been commissioned and funding has been provided to commission the remainder.</P>
        <P>The national health strategy asserts the Department of Health and Children's commitment to using public private partnership's as a means of accelerating the provision of health infrastructure in accordance with general Government policy. PPP pilots are currently being piloted in the health sector in the area of community nursing units, CNUs, for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will <Col N="361"/>be created when the initial pilot programme is complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds for older people. The services offered in these units will include: assessment/rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence. Furthermore, day centres for the elderly will be combined with the CNUs in each site to help promote the dignity and independence of older people living in the community.</P>
        <P>The Department is also involved with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in an ongoing process of designing and developing CNUs for older people through the traditional procurement method rather than through the PPP process. A number of such projects are at an advanced stage of planning and consist in the main of 50-bed community nursing units with associated day care facilities. In some instances these new units will replace existing unsuitable accommodation while in other cases these developments will increase the number of public long-stay beds available for older people. These submissions are being considered in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy indicates, the figures from the Central Statistics Office collated from the results of the census suggest that the average age of the population is increasing. Projections based on the 1996 census indicate that in 1996, 402,000 or 11.5% of the Irish population were over 65. Forecasts suggest that by 2031 this figure will have more than doubled and that the percentage of the population aged over 65 will be between 18% and 21% at that stage. The Government is aware of this trend and addressed some of the issues arising from it in its health strategy publication, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, published in 2001.</P>
        <P>In so far as the development of services to meet an increasing population of older people is concerned the health strategy outlined the need for certain developments. Regarding community services, the following was recommended: recruitment of a multidisciplinary range of staff to support the development of primary care services such as domicilliary care, and day and respite services; the provision of 7,000 day centre places. The following were recommended in respect of hospital services: 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds; associated development of acute geriatric medical services and appointment of additional geriatricians; and 600 additional day <Col N="362"/>hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. Residential care recommendations included: 5,600 additional extended care/community nursing unit places over a seven to ten year period, including provision for people with dementia; and improved staffing levels in extended care units. The provision of the above services is contingent on the necessary resources being made available. On performance, national standards for community and long-term residential care of older people will be prepared.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 over &euro;270 million in additional revenue funding has been provided for the development of services for older people. In addition, significant capital funding has been made available through the national development plan for the provision of additional extended care and associated facilities around the country.</P>
        <P>Proposals are also being developed for the provision of an extra 850 long-stay beds in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health Board areas under a public private partnership pilot scheme and the preparation of business cases is well advanced.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in June 2003 my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs published the Study to Examine the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, undertaken by Mercer Limited. This study considers possible financing options, including private sector or combined public private sector approaches, use of the PRSI system to finance-fund long-term care or alternatively, whether the current system of long-term care financing, through taxation, should remain the <i>status quo</i>. I understand that the Minister intends to undertake a wide process of consultation to initiate a public debate on the matter before a decision is made on the best way forward.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission On Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The commission has met on 21 occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 11 November 2003. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline &mdash; medical, legal, scientific and social &mdash; prepared a report outlining the current <Col N="364"/>position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that the work group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</P>
        <P>The commission organised a one-day conference in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, ethical and legal factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.</P>
        <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. Over 1,600 of these were received and examined.</P>
        <P>I understand that the commission has engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include a survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics. A survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland. The commission issued a survey instrument to a random sample to 50% of GPs in all health board areas. I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed responded. The commission also issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproduction services. The commission has also surveyed public attitudes and opinions on a range of questions related to assisted human reproduction. I understand that the commission will complete its report shortly. Its recommendations will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

	<P>The EU now has one of the most rigorous regimes for the pre-marketing assessment of GMOs as well as food and feed derived from GMOs. Under current EU laws and new EU legislation to come into force in April 2004, only GM foods that satisfy the highest standards of safety will be allowed on the market. In the event of a problem being identified with a GM food provisions allow for its temporary or long-term removal from the marketplace.</P>
        <P>Ireland applies EU legislation on genetically modified, GM, foods and, at present, has no additional national legislation. Under EU rules, only authorised GM foods or ingredients can be placed on the market and these foods must be labelled appropriately to allow consumers to choose. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of legislation governing GM food and carries out regular checks of the marketplace to ensure compliance with GM food legislation.</P>
        <P>Under new legislation the safety assessment of all GM products will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, a new independent agency set up specifically for this purpose. Once a GM food is authorised new legislation on traceability and labelling will ensure full traceability of GMOs throughout the chain from farm to table providing consumers with comprehensive information by labelling all food and feed consisting of, containing, or produced from, a GMO.</P>
        <P>Consumer safety and consumer choice are paramount in the approach taken to GM foods as reflected in the extent of the legislation developed to deal with this sensitive area. No credible evidence has yet been provided to show that GM foods pose a risk to human health; in addition, measures to allow post-release monitoring of GM foods are provided for in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of authorised GM foods, or foods containing GM ingredients placed on the market in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004 my Department, working in partnership with a range of interests, will continue to drive the implementation of the primary care strategy and to develop policy in this regard. The implementation process is being overseen by the national primary care steering group, which is representative of a wide range of stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The detailed planning for implementation of the health services reform programme will allow the development of service delivery and administrative structures which best facilitate the implementation of the interdisciplinary model of primary care as an integral part of a whole-system <Col N="366"/>approach to service delivery. My Department will also work with the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board on the development of primary care services in their regions as an essential component of the hospitals reform programme being undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the national task force on medical staffing.</P>
        <P>Work will also be undertaken by the health boards to further develop the ten primary care implementation projects &mdash; one in each health board area &mdash; which I have approved. These projects are building on the services and resources already in place in the locations involved so as to develop a primary care team in line with the multidisciplinary model described in the strategy. The necessary revenue funding to enable the appointment of the required additional personnel has been provided in each case. These projects are currently at different stages of development, with a number already providing new or enhanced primary care services to their target populations.</P>
        <P>The primary care strategy indicated that a significant component of the development of primary care teams, in the short to medium term, would involve the reorientation of existing staff and resources. My Department has therefore asked the health boards to develop initiatives to give effect to multidisciplinary team-working on a more widespread basis. This will include reorganisation of current resources within primary care and community services and the development of collaborative initiatives between the providers of primary care services and with providers and users within the wider health system. In addition, the health boards have also been asked to complete a mapping exercise to plan the locations for future primary care teams and networks within their respective regions.</P>
        <P>My Department is at present developing a policy document which is intended to expand upon the key principles in the strategy to assist in informing the process of forming primary care teams and networks on a system-wide basis. This document will be published in the course of 2004.</P>
        <P>Work has been undertaken by the individual health boards on a highlevel needs assessment and, once completed, this will be followed by the development of appropriate templates to enable more detailed assessments to be undertaken at a local level. The future human resource requirements for the overall implementation of primary care policy will be informed by this needs assessment process and by the mapping exercises being conducted by each health board.</P>

Under the terms of the consultants' common <Col N="367"/>contract, consultants are entitled to engage in private practice within the hospital or hospitals in which they are employed. Placement of patients on a waiting list for private treatment is essentially, in the first instance, a matter for the consultant concerned.

Issues concerning private practice will be pursued in the context of the negotiations on the new consultant's contract.</P>

	<P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 2002 was published on 10 September 2003. I welcome the publication of this report and acknowledge the important role that the Inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In his 2002 report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities, from 4,256 at the end of 2001 to 3,966 at the end of 2002. Approximately 11%, 2,723, of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 2002 were involuntary admissions. Ireland has a significantly higher rate of involuntary admission than other European countries. However, it is anticipated that the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 with its more stringent procedures for involuntary detention, will significantly reduce the number of involuntary admissions, bringing practice in this country more into line with the rest of Europe.</P>
        <P>In his report, the inspector refers to the ongoing replacement of old institutional mental hospitals with acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. He expresses disappointment at the failure of the newly constructed psychiatric units at Portlaoise General Hospital and Castlebar Regional Hospital to open as planned in 2002. However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the unit in Castlebar opened in December 2003 and that the Portlaoise unit is expected to open shortly. The opening of three more units is pending.</P>
        <P>The inspector welcomed the considerable reinforcement of various sub-specialties within psychiatry, with the appointment of additional consultants in later-life psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry and liaison psychiatry in general hospitals and he is complimentary of the developments in mental health care in all health <Col N="368"/>boards and highlights the many improvements which have taken place in the care of the mentally ill over recent years.</P>
        <P>The inspector has welcomed the establishment of the Mental Health Commission in April 2002. The commission will be the main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the new Mental Health Act 2001 and its independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services in the coming years.</P>
        <P>An expert group on mental health policy, which I established in 2003 is preparing a new national policy framework for the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future. As part of the process the expert group is now examining written submissions on the matter.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that, while I am pleased with the scale of the progress being made in many of the services, I accept that much remains to be done in providing a service which will enhance the quality of life of those suffering from mental illness. It is my intention to facilitate the service providers in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector as quickly as possible and I am fully committed to ensuring that the recommendations made in the inspector's report for 2002 are followed up as soon as possible.</P>

In other words a hospital should be funded for the patients they actually treat.</P>
        <P>The reason hospitals fare differently under the programme is that each hospital's cost per case is compared with that of its peers, for example, the cost of a tonsillectomy in one teaching hospital versus another. The peer group sets the mean for each type of case treated, not my Department. Those whose cost per case is higher than the mean have some of their funding redistributed to those whose cost per case is lower.</P>
        <Miles com="cl" par="115" />
        <P>The programme is operated in an open and transparent fashion, and full details of the clinical and financial information on which casemix budget adjustments are based is provided to all participating hospitals.</P><Col N="369"/>
        <Miles com="fc" />
        <P>Admissions through accident and emergency do not have a bearing on results as the complexity of cases admitted as emergencies is fully taken into account. Issues such as excessive length of stay and severe complexity are all considered. Hospitals are not given a profile of patients that they must treat but rather they are judged on their relative efficiency in treating their cases versus their peers.</P>
        <P>Casemix is an internationally accepted management system for the monitoring and evaluation of health services which allows for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated, in the hope that it would assist hospitals to define their products, measure their productivity, and assess quality.</P>
        <P>The key benefit of casemix measurement is the extent to which it provides a common language for service planning, management and development that is meaningful to both clinicians and managers, and facilitates cost comparison, clinical audit, strategic services planning and the collection of meaningful epidemiological data. It is the only model capable of dealing with the complexities of resource allocation within the hospital service. I am committed to the expansion of the programme as a central pillar in the budgetary process.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive review of the entire national casemix programme has been carried out by the casemix unit of my Department. This review has taken place in an open, inclusive manner and included consultation with all the stakeholders in the process, including hospital managers and clinicians.</P>
        <P>The intention of the review was to ensure that the system is fair and accurate, and robust enough to incorporate all the strategic developments being proposed in the medium-term. A report on the matter is presently being prepared which will make recommendations for the enhancement of the model. This will result in Ireland having one of the most advanced casemix systems in the world, while still being an &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; system for Irish patients.</P>

        <P>My Department is not included in the decentralisation proposals announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, although I am conscious that some members of staff may wish to avail of the opportunity to decentralise. An implementation committee has been appointed by the Minister for Finance to drive the process forward and this committee has been asked to prepare and submit an overall implementation plan to the Minister by end-March. There are no plans to conduct a survey in advance of the preparation of this plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 220, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The document entitled Explanatory Memoranda: An OPC Perspective, was prepared in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government in response to the Law Reform Commission report, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law. The paper examined explanatory memoranda to Bills and contained a set of draft guidelines to assist Departments in the preparation of explanatory memoranda.</P>
        <P>It has always been recognised that it takes a considerable period of time to train new parliamentary counsel but in recent years the period has been much reduced. To further aid the process, the office put in place in December 2002 a training plan which is being implemented in respect of the five drafters recruited since August 2002. The plan is comprehensive covering competencies, training topics, guidelines for on-the-job training, checklist for reviewing drafts, induction checklist, relationship between advisory counsel and parliamentary counsel on drafting files, training log and on-line legislative drafting resources.</P>
        <P>The office, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, has put in place a knowledge management strategy, an element of which ensures that parliamentary counsel are informed on a range of issues, including European Union law, European Convention on Human Rights, international law and decisions of the Supreme Court in respect of statutory interpretation and the constitutionality of legislation.</P>
        <P>Copies of Statutory Instruments: Drafting Checklist and Guidelines, prepared in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, were issued to Government Departments and offices in March 2003. A copy of the drafting manual containing guidelines and precedents to assist drafters was placed in the Oireachtas <Col N="372"/>Library in September 2003. These documents were not published as they were prepared for officials involved in drafting statutory instruments and for parliamentary counsel and are subject to review.</P>
        <P>The primary function of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government is to draft Bills and Government orders. It is a matter for Departments and offices to submit statutory instruments to the office for settling or drafting. The engagement of outside counsel did not arise from any failure in the service provided by the office but rather by a desire to enable Departments to tackle within a short period of time a backlog of EU measures which awaited transposition. In that context, the initiative was very successful and the European Commission last week complimented Ireland when figures were released showing us as meeting the 1.5% target for implementation of the EU Internal Market laws. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel produced 17 Bills during the period commencing the last parliamentary session and the commencement of this session.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which forms part of the Office of the Attorney General and is organised into three groups each servicing a number of Departments, is very effective. It would not be efficient to have it dispersed among Departments. Parliamentary counsel work in close co-operation with advisory counsel in the Office of the Attorney General in the preparation of legislation. The Attorney General advises the Government on the constitutionality of legislation and in relation to other legal issues that arise.</P>
        <P>The number of Bills enacted in recent years has increased dramatically as is evidenced by the following table.</P>

	<P el="0">The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. The most recent information available is for December 2003. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers and seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey.</P>
        <P>The number of persons registered for unemployment assistance over the last 12 months, as requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table:</P><Col N="373"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>The second report of the Government's information society action plan, New Connections, will be published at the end of this month. The report demonstrates that considerable progress has been achieved in positioning Ireland as a leading location for knowledge-based economic activity and highlights the significance of the information society agenda in the overall context of the economy, both from an Irish and international perspective, and also its strong potential to promote a socially inclusive society.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2003, the Cabinet Committee on the Information Society agreed the services to be prioritised for e-enablement, having regard to <Col N="375"/>their potential user base and value in terms of efficiency and effectiveness or as flagship projects. The report lists those services that are prioritised for on-line delivery by 2005 and includes detailed information about services that are currently available on-line.</P>
        <P>A more complex view of e-Government has evolved since the last progress report was published in February 2003. The Information Society Commission report on e-Government, published in November last year, warned of the danger of putting services on-line purely for the sake of putting them on-line and recommended that only services that had a tangible benefit and made economic sense in terms of return on investment should be made available on-line.</P>
        <P>Against this background, the Government's objective in making services available on-line is to focus on common or more frequently used services where technology can have an impact in terms of convenience to the user and can demonstrate tangible efficiencies. Indeed, internationally, while there was an initial push for both Government and commercial organisations to establish a web presence, the emphasis is now increasingly towards getting maximum value by improving background business processes.</P>
        <P>Also, the advances that are being made in mobile phone technologies and the high penetration rate that these devices have achieved mean that service providers have to look at this channel as a potentially viable means of delivery because it is a relatively low cost technology and it is ubiquitous. In other words, it may be more cost-efficient and more service effective to put government &ldquo;on-the-line&rdquo; rather than on-line. One aspect being examined, for example, is the use of contact centres where citizens can conduct enquiries and transactions over the telephone.</P>
        <P>There is also an increasing realisation globally of the real benefits to be gained from the prudent exploitation of technologies in the internal mechanisms of government, particularly as a driver of public service modernisation. Taking a wider perspective on &ldquo;service&rdquo; means that public service organisations also consider the manner in which they use public resources on behalf of those who do not necessarily use &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; services or are in receipt of State assistance, but who pay their taxes and have an expectation that they are being used to best effect. The challenge is to exploit technology where it can add value in a modernised public service.</P>
        <P>The recent announcement on decentralisation has added a new dimension to the modernisation process and will require a new perspective on the deployment of information and communications technologies, ICTs, to support the work of a more geographically disparate organisation that must operate in a more connected or joined up way. This issue is currently being considered by my <Col N="376"/>Department and the Department of Finance in consultation with other relevant Departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 to 227, inclusive, and 229 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the report by the former Supreme Court judge, Henry Barron, into the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The bombings were terrible outrages, which left 34 people dead and more than 240 injured. Many people never recovered and for many others, the legacy of pain and suffering remains and some still suffer from their injuries to this day. Like everyone else who watched the proceedings of the sub-committee considering the Barron report last week, I found the accounts of the victims and families about the events of that day and their terrible suffering profoundly moving.</P>
        <P>I was very glad to have had the opportunity, together with Mr. Justice Barron, to meet with representatives of Justice for the Forgotten at their request on Wednesday, 10 December, before the publication of the report on what was a very important day, especially for the families.</P>
        <P>At that meeting, I thanked Mr. Justice Barron and his team for their work in bringing that phase of their work to a conclusion and I paid tribute to Justice for the Forgotten for its assistance to the inquiry and for its dedication and tenacity in pursuing its campaign for the truth. I also paid tribute to the earlier work of the former Chief Justice, the late Liam Hamilton.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights is now considering, including in public session, the report of the independent commission and it will report back to the D&aacute;il and Seanad in March with its findings on whether the report addresses all of the issues covered in the terms of reference of the inquiry; the lessons to be drawn and any actions to be taken in the light of the report, its findings <Col N="377"/>and conclusions; and, whether, having regard to the report's findings, and, following consultations with the inquiry, a further public inquiry into any aspect of the report would be required or fruitful. The committee may also accept, including in public session, submissions on the report from interested persons and bodies.</P>
        <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, has said that the British Government will consider the report with great care and he has said that the British Government, from Prime Minister Blair down, has been committed to helping the inquiry as fully as possible. He also said after the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Farmleigh last week that the British Government wanted to be as helpful as possible. I am aware that the Secretary of State, as well as some of his predecessors, have been invited by the sub-committee to assist it in its work and I would hope that the assistance already referred to also extends to the work of the sub-committee. At my most recent meeting with Prime Minister Blair on Monday, 19 January I asked for the fullest co-operation from the British Government with the Oireachtas sub-committee.</P>
        <P>I understand that Mr. Justice Barron will report early in the coming months on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and following that report, on the other cases referred to him, including the S&eacute;amus Ludlow case, the Dundalk bombing of 1975 and in the context of these reports he will report on the Belturbet bombing.</P>
        <P>The total cost of the Barron inquiry to date is approximately &euro;2,541,000. This includes an amount of approximately &euro;693,000 for the legal expenses of the Justice for the Forgotten group and &euro;167,000 for the administrative expenses of the group. Currently, the administrative costs of the group, as well as the services to victims provided by the group, are also being paid for by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In this regard, approximately &euro;0.5 million has been paid to date. In addition, offers have been made to the legal representatives of the relatives in connection with the inquests of the those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
        <P>The members of the Remembrance Fund Commission were appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in December 2003. A sum of &euro;9 million has been allocated to the commission for victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland for dispersal over the next three years.</P>
        <P>The fund was established following on from the report of the former T&aacute;naiste, John Wilson, the sole member of the Victims Commission. The report made a number of recommendations, including regarding acknowledgement payments to those who were bereaved as a result of the conflict and also relating to the ongoing medical expenses of victims who are still suffering as a result of their injuries. It is expected that the <Col N="378"/>commission will be in a position to invite applications for funding shortly.</P>

	<P>In the context of the launch by Amnesty International of its report, Human Rights Begin at Home: Recommendations to Ireland's EU Presidency, on 13 January 2004, a representative of the organisation commented that arms brokering deals made on Irish soil are killing <Col N="379"/>civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere. However, the specific basis for these allegations is unclear and I am not aware of any such activities taking place in Ireland. Indeed, one newspaper report of the allegations stated that, despite claims by Amnesty International that there was plenty of anecdotal evidence, a spokeswoman for the organisation could not name one such deal that had been brokered in Ireland or say what parties had been involved.</P>
        <P>While Ireland, along with some other EU member states, does not currently have legislation on arms brokering, we are committed to introducing legislation in line with the EU common position on arms brokering that was adopted last June.</P>

The review, which will cover a wide range of issue, including arms brokering, will recommend how best we can modernise and strengthen them to ensure full compliance with our international obligations.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As provided for in the PPF, consideration has been given to the mainstreaming of certain essential services provided through community employment. In this regard, approximately 4,500 community employment places in schools have been mainstreamed over the past number of years. This involved the appropriate degree of funding being transferred to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of relevant services in schools. In addition, in the region of 2,300 places have peen provided on the social economy programme.</P>
        <P>Detailed discussions took place during 2002 involving the Department of Health and Children, health boards, F&Aacute;S and sponsor groups, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, with regard to the possible mainstreaming of health sector places. However, due to the amount of additional funding required by the Department of Health and Children to mainstream these positions, and having regard to other major demands on the health budget, it was not possible to proceed with mainstreaming.</P>
        <P>The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes, community employment, job initiative and social economy. F&Aacute;S is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. This allocation, &euro;351 million, is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. Accordingly, there will be no reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels in 2004.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The agency, through its project <Col N="382"/>divisions and network of overseas offices, is actively marketing County Kerry to overseas investors as a potential location for foreign direct investment. However, the current economic slowdown has meant that fewer companies are actively seeking to invest overseas. Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations are taken by overseas investors. In 2003 five overseas investors visited Kerry, including two who visited north Kerry.</P>
        <P>In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland is also working with the existing base of companies in the county with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities. There is a diverse range of companies located in Kerry, representing a number of industry sectors, including manufacturing, international services, engineering, pharmaceuticals and consumer products. IDA Ireland believes that a number of these have the potential to expand and or take on additional responsibilities or activities.</P>
        <P>To continue to enhance the attractiveness of Kerry as a location for inward investment, IDA commenced site development works in 2002 on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul in Killarney. This site development work, which is now complete, involved significant landscaping, access development and site clearance work, all of which has resulted in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location.</P>
        <P>In addition, a local group of business people, have completed a new building of 14,716 square feet on a site acquired from IDA on the business and technology park and IDA Ireland is actively marketing this facility as an alternative property solution to present to potential investors.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland believes that these investments, together with other available facilities such as Kerry technology park in Tralee, will put Kerry in a position to compete more competitively for inward investment in the manufacturing, ICT, software and international services sectors. The designation of both Tralee and Killarney as hub towns under the Government's national spatial strategy will also add to the attractiveness of the county for overseas investment.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland believes that regions need magnets of attraction, some compelling business reason or unique selling proposition, that will attract investors. The challenge of achieving high value FDI into regional locations is considerable; nevertheless, progress is being made. Each region needs a hub of attraction around which, for approximately 40 or 50 kilometres in every direction, the region can grow through attracting a wide range of enterprises, both local and international, which emerge because of the integrated competitive strengths of that region.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA in Kerry, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional <Col N="383"/>development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Kerry.</P>

	<P>The Employment Permits Act 2003, which came into force in April 2003, provides for the freedom of movement, for purposes of work, of nationals of the ten EU accession states after accession. This means that after EU enlargement on 1 May 2004, employers will no longer require work permits to employ nationals of these states. Accordingly, a very significant source of potential labour will become available to Irish employers outside the work permit system, which should be of considerable benefit to employers who have not been able to find appropriate staff within the existing Irish or wider EEA labour markets.</P>

	<P>The Government and the European Commission met in Dublin Castle on 6 January for an in depth discussion of Ireland's EU Presidency priorities. On that occasion, I had very useful discussions with the Commissioners who have responsibility for Competitiveness Council dossiers.</P>
        <P>I have published a priorities paper for the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, which I will chair during the Presidency. The programme for the Competitiveness Council is firmly rooted in the ten-year strategy for growth, economic reform and job creation agreed by the Lisbon European Council in 2000. The priorities paper is available in English, Irish and French and is also posted on the official Irish Presidency website at <i>www.eu2004.ie.</i></P>
        <P>On 21 January, I presented the Competitiveness Council work programme and priorities to two European Parliament Committees, the Industry, Trade, Research and Energy Committee, and the Legal Affairs and Internal Market Committee. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, presented the relevant aspects of the programme of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council of Ministers, for which my Department <Col N="384"/>takes the lead role, to the Employment and Social Policy Committee of the European Parliament on 22 January.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon agenda of economic, social and environmental renewal of the EU is a key overarching priority for the Irish Presidency. Progress on the achievement of the agenda and measures to give renewed impetus to advancing economic reform, enhancing competitiveness and stimulating employment in Europe will be the focus of the spring European Council on 25-26 March 2004.</P>
        <P>I will chair two formal meetings of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, which are scheduled to take place in Brussels on 11 March and 17-18 May 2004. Particular stress will be laid by Ireland on the need for the Competitiveness Council to focus on and develop its horizontal remit in line with the Seville European Council in June 2002 and the Presidency conclusions of the 2003 spring summit. It is important that there is attention at the highest political level on issues affecting the competitiveness of enterprise and I see the role of the Competitiveness Council as central to achieving this. The Council will also discuss a range of issues in areas such as enterprise, research and innovation policies and the completion and effective operation of the internal market, particularly with regard to the services sector. Specific dossiers on issues relating to intellectual property, including the proposal for a community patent, company law and consumer policy will also feature on the Council's agenda. I will also chair an informal meeting of EU and accession Ministers responsible for competitiveness, which is scheduled to take place at Dromoland Castle, County Clare on 26-27 April. The meeting will focus on industrial strategy and innovation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will chair the sessions of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, ESPHCA, Council dealing with items on which my Department takes the lead such as the European employment strategy and other relevant individual dossiers. The ESPHCA Council is scheduled to meet in formal session on 4-5 March and 1-2 June 2004. The March Council will be used to focus attention on the key issues arising from the employment task force report. The main employment issue at the June Council will be to finalise the employment package for the June European Council. The Irish Presidency will seek to promote closer co-operation with the two sides of industry in facilitating change and helping in the effective transformation of the European economy. To this end it will convene a tripartite social summit with the EU level social partners in advance of the 2004 spring European Council. The Irish Presidency is working with the Commission and the European social partners with a view to adopting &ldquo;A European Partnership for Change&rdquo; as an overall theme for this summit and identifying all of the actors involved with <Col N="385"/>advancing the economic, social and environmental goals of the Lisbon agenda.</P>
        <P>On 16 January, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, co-chaired, along with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, an informal meeting of Ministers for employment and social policy in Galway. The meeting focused on the theme of &ldquo;Making Work Pay&rdquo;, which is a key priority for the member states of the European Union and a core objective in the EU level process to support the modernisation of social protection systems. On the previous day the Irish Presidency convened a Council troika meeting with the social partners and the social platform of NGOs, at which a fruitful discussion was held on the issues of &ldquo;Adaptability and Change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Making Work Pay&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Both the Competitiveness and ESPHCA Councils will make significant contributions towards the preparation of the spring European Council meeting next March.</P>
        <P>My Department will also be responsible for EU Council work on European common commercial policy matters during the Irish Presidency. This will involve the organisation and chairing of Council meetings at ministerial and official level in Dublin, Brussels, Geneva, Paris and elsewhere. Among the substantive issues to be dealt with will be the World Trade Organisation negotiations and the European Union's trade relations with various countries and regions.</P>
        <P>In addition to the formal Presidency agenda, my Department is organising a number of further Presidency-related meetings in Ireland. The calendar of such events, across all policy areas, has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

	<P>On 8 October 2001 Regulation EC No. 2157/2001 to establish a European company statute (Societas Europaea) and a related Directive 2001/86/EC concerning worker involvement in European companies was adopted by the European Council. The European company statute is a new legal instrument that gives companies with commercial interests in more than one member state the option of forming a European company, SE, the objective of which is to make it easier for such companies to operate across the EU.</P>
        <P>The regulation, which has direct application in member states, and the directive, which will have to be transposed into law in all member states, will enter into force on 8 October 2004.</P>
        <P>Under the European company statute, an SE can be set up by the creation of a holding <Col N="386"/>company or a joint subsidiary or by the merger of companies located in at least two member states or by the conversion of an existing company set up under national law which has a subsidiary in another member state. The European company statute therefore provides existing companies with the option of restructuring on the basis of their being one legal entity European company, with branches throughout the EU rather than having subsidiaries under the national laws of each member state in which they operate.</P>
        <P>The regulation contains other requirements relating, for example, to the manner of control and management, and where no specific requirements are stipulated, the national law relating to public limited companies will apply.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the European company statute will be attractive for companies seeking an efficient structure to operate on a pan-European basis and that it will enable companies to expand and restructure their cross-border operations without the costly and time-consuming complex network of subsidiaries governed by different national laws. It is seen as a step forward in efforts to make the internal market a practical reality for business, and to encourage more companies to exploit cross-border opportunities.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaged in consultations with interested parties regarding the necessary legislative arrangements to provide for the operation of the European company statute.</P>

	<P>As part of the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, future participation in community employment by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in community employment and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training and education options, where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.</P>
        <P>The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three-year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. Participants are considered for an extension if, on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on community employment, they are likely to <Col N="387"/>experience difficulty in getting employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. F&Aacute;S currently has discretion to offer up to 20% of the total number of community employment participants a further period on the programme on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>The community employment programme is currently under review. A decision on the future eligibility criteria for participants on community employment will be taken when the current review process has been brought to a conclusion.</P>

A further 40 files relating to policy, general administration and operation of both the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the redundancy payments section of the Department were retained under section 8(2) of the National Archives Act 1986 because they are in regular use in the Department and their transfer to the National Archives would seriously interfere with the administration of the Department.</P>

	<P el="0">I no longer have responsibility for insurance undertakings. From 1 May 2003, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is responsible for practically all of the financial services industry, including the registration and supervision of insurance undertakings and the services by them. I do, however, retain responsibility for the insurance reform programme.</P>
        <P>I am aware of serious difficulties being experienced by businesses due to the high cost of insurance. The insurance reform programme that I announced on the 25th of October 2002 is progressing well. This programme comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date, 32 of the recommendations have been fully implemented, three partially implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations. The measures provide for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December 2003 and was signed into law on 28 December 2003. The Act will be commenced in early 2004 providing for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis and allowing the board to deal with cases.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Competition Authority are to conduct a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. A significant amount of the work was completed in 2003 and a report will be produced in the near future.</P>
        <P>I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Government Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</P>
        <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers generally make decisions about whether they are prepared to quote for a particular risk, and if so, at what premium level, based on their underwriting experience or assessment of that risk in the market. <Col N="389"/>Governments are free to take action, which affects the operation of the insurance market. The insurance reform programme has impacted favourably on the insurance market.</P>
        <P>There is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the measures the Government is putting in place to reform the Irish insurance market will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premiums to consumers and businesses. It is heartening to report that a number of insurers have already announced reductions of 15% to 20% in motor and more recently public liability premiums. As implementation of the reform programme continues, I expect reductions to occur in all forms of insurance. I am confident that these measures will attract new players into the market and lead to further downward pressure on premiums.</P>
        <P>I am keen to encourage other insurers to enter this market. Improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market make it more attractive to firms that do not have a presence in Ireland. Over the coming months, I intend to meet representatives of potential new entrants to the market.</P>
        <P>Many of the measures contained in the MIAB recommendations will have the effect of encouraging competition, including those relating to transparency and the provision of information to consumers. Examples of recommendations that have been implemented which are promoting competition include the provision of 15 days notice at renewal time for motor insurance policies, which give consumers the opportunity to shop around; regulations that prescribe that no-claims bonus documentation be provided with renewal notices to assists consumers who wish to shop around; the provision of comparative tables of insurance quotes which IFSRA now publishes on its website on a three monthly basis; the incorporation of the principle of &ldquo;acting against the public interest&rdquo; in the Competition Act 2002; codes of practice in the insurance industry now require insurers who refuse to quote for any particular risk to state their reason in writing upon request; the Irish Insurance Federation in its code of practice has agreed a code of conduct with its member companies on anti-competitive behaviour, subject to more formalised measures, which may be adopted by IFSRA under competition law; and the Competition Authority has a duty to review all further insurance mergers in the interests of the Irish economy with appropriate reference to IFSRA, and the process of consultation seeks to protect the interests of specific policyholder groups since the effects of mergers may warrant consideration about issues of the market as a whole.</P>
        <P>The joint study by the Competition Authority and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment into insurance will produce a report in the near future. Recommendations resulting from that report will be implemented.</P>

	<P>The board of management of Clare LES advised F&Aacute;S on 15 December last that they were discontinuing operations effective from 30 January 2004. A decision of this nature is a matter solely for the board. A meeting was held in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday, 21 January 2004, between myself and representatives of Clare Local Employment Service staff to discuss the imminent closure of the Clare LES. Also present were a number of other Clare public representatives including the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, a union representative, two departmental officials and two representatives of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>It was pointed out that while the board of Clare LES is made up of representatives from the statutory and voluntary sectors, and the operation of the service is funded by F&Aacute;S, it is nonetheless a separate legal entity and I have no function in relation to the internal workings of a body of this kind. I did, however, agree to ask F&Aacute;S to immediately commence an assessment of the labour market data and needs of the Clare region in the context of the closure of the LES. This assessment will include the type and level of a dedicated employment service necessary to address the needs of marginalised client groups in the region, including structures, management, staffing and other relevant requirements of any such service. I have asked F&Aacute;S to come back to me with proposals in relation to an enhanced dedicated service for Clare as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am concerned about the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums, especially in relation to young drivers. The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date 32 of the recommendations have been fully implemented, three partially implemented and work is in <Col N="391"/>progress on the implementation of the other recommendations.</P>

The Act will be commenced in early 2004 providing for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis and allowing the board to deal with cases.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Competition Authority have undertaken a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. A significant amount of the work was completed in 2003 and a report will be produced in the near future.</P>
        <P>I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Government Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</P>
        <P>The MIAB recommendations that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is charged with progressing, deal with issues relating to public information, promotion of competition, transparency and consumer protection. One such recommendation relates to gathering of statistics on motor insurance and claims costs by IFSRA. On 10 December 2003, <Col N="392"/>IFSRA published its first set of comparative tables of motor insurance quotations on its website, <i>www.ifsra.ie</i>. The motor insurance cost survey is based on eight driver profiles and is designed to show the range of quotes available for specific drivers in Ireland. Regular surveys will be published on the IFSRA website at three monthly intervals. This may be of particular interest to young drivers and demonstrates the advantages of shopping around.</P>
        <P>While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance there is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms being undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premiums to consumers and businesses. A number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premiums and the CSO has noted a significant contribution from insurance to the recent reduction in inflation. As implementation of the reform programme continues, I expect further reductions to occur.</P>

	<P>An informal meeting of Ministers of Employment and Social Policy was held in Galway on 16 January. Ministers and their officials attended from the 15 EU member states, the 10 accession states, the three applicant states and Norway. In addition, representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council secretariat attended. The meeting focused on the theme, &ldquo;Making Work Pay&rdquo;, which is a key priority for the member states of the European Union and a core objective in the EU level process to support the modernisation of social protection systems.</P>
        <P>The meeting was preceded by a Council troika meeting on 15 January, attended by Ministers from the Netherlands and Luxembourg together with representatives of the EU Commission, the European Parliament, the Council secretariat, the social partners and the social platform of NGOs. There was a fruitful discussion on the issues of &ldquo;Adaptability and Change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Making Work Pay.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The informal and troika meetings were held in the Corrib Great Southern Hotel and both were co-chaired by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, and me. The Presidency papers which provided the basis for the discussion at the meetings and the conclusions from the meetings are posted on the official Irish Presidency website at <i>www.eu2004.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The delegations and their supporting staff were accommodated in the following hotels: Great Southern, Eyre Square, Corrib Great Southern, Flannery's Hotel and the Westwood House Hotel. As joint presidents of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, and in line with established practice, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and I co-hosted a dinner for the delegations and guests on 15 and 16 January in the Ardilaun House Hotel and the Radisson Hotel respectively. Lunch was provided in the Corrib Great Southern Hotel. Evening entertainment was provided by Con Tempo, the Inisbofin Ceilidh Band, Macnas, Kathleen Loughnane, Celtic Legends and Eleanor Shanley. Norita Ni Chart&uacute;ir compered the entertainment programme on 16 January. Sponsorship for the bulk of the entertainment programme was provided by Galway Chamber of Commerce, Galway City Council, Galway County Council, Tourism West and the Radisson Hotel.</P>
        <P>The budget for the informal and troika meetings was &euro;670,000 to be funded jointly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and my own Department. As all invoices have not yet been received I am not in a position to give definitive costs for the event but I expect it to be within budget.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The agency, through its project divisions and network of overseas offices, is actively marketing its factory in Athy to overseas investors as a potential location for foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>A profile of the facility has been circulated to IDA Ireland's overseas offices informing them of its competitive rental rate in comparison to locations like Dublin. Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations are taken by overseas investors.</P>
        <P>There have been four site visits to the factory over the past 12 months. Feedback from IDA clients suggests that the facility is attractive as a potential location for foreign direct investment. A possible tenant who expressed interest in the advance factory in 2003 has been in communication with IDA Ireland again in early January 2004 regarding plans to set up in Ireland. The project is slow to get to fruition as negotiations are still taking place between the company and a locally based multinational to secure a contractual supply agreement.</P>
        <P>As regards the other named company, Shuttleworth, I am told it made a commercial decision that it was not sustainable to continue its business in Ireland. Over the past five years the overall challenges for IDA supported companies have been difficult and involve a period of transition from dependence on the more cost competitive sectors into the higher value added activities. Part of this transition has involved job reductions and losses in long established companies and reinforces the importance and urgency of attracting the more modern industrial and higher value added activities.</P>
        <P>The success of our economy during the 1990s and into this decade means that Ireland is now much less competitive as a location for low wage manufacturing projects. As such Ireland, must now gear itself towards attracting a different type of investor. The focus for the future must be to attract investment requiring high skill levels, that is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated, and that links in to an increasingly sophisticated business environment.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S, the national training and placement authority, which also operates under the aegis of my Department, is making available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses to assist those made redundant to find suitable alternative employment.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland and F&Aacute;S, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will yield results in terms <Col N="396"/>of attracting additional sustainable overseas investment and jobs for Athy.</P>

	<P el="0">Upon the announcement of the decentralisation programme in budget 2004, my Department's management board and I considered what options were available to put into effect the decision to relocate 250 staff to Carlow. I was anxious that every effort should be made to preserve the coherence of the Department's policy development and legislative role by retaining an effective policy advisory and legislative function in Dublin. I was, of course, also keen to ensure coherence in the activities being decentralised.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I have decided that staff of the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the work permits, labour inspectorate, redundancy and insolvency and employment rights sections of my Department should relocate to Carlow. This is a coherent and synergistic set of activities concentrating on services to business, consumers and employees. It will provide a grade structure that will allow for full career development for <Col N="397"/>those officers electing to move, will minimise the potential loss of intellectual capital and corporate memory, and will ensure that my Department's abilities in these roles will not be diminished in any way.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works have established an implementation committee to prepare and submit an overall implementation plan to a new Cabinet sub-committee by the end of March 2004. My Department is represented on this implementation committee. I expect this committee and the new Cabinet sub-committee to agree a plan for decentralisation that will maximise the effectiveness of decentralisation, and minimise any disruptions and inefficiencies, which may occur within the programme.</P>
        <P>My Department has also established a decentralisation committee to oversee the programme within the Department and those of its agencies selected for relocation. This committee will work to ensure that we continue to deliver a quality service to our customers and that the needs of those within the Department who may be affected by decentralisation continue to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department are keeping me apprised of developments with regard to the implementation of the programme, which presents considerable challenges to us all.</P>

	<P>The military aspects of crisis management which arise under the European security and defence policy, ESDP, are the areas of primary concern to my Department. In this regard, great progress has been achieved by successive EU Presidencies towards developing the EU's capabilities to carry out Petersberg Tasks operations such as peacekeeping, humanitarian and peace support operations.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the operational capability of the European Union was demonstrated through the launching of four ESDP operations. These were the EU police mission, EUPM, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation Concordia in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, Operation Artemis in Bunia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the police mission, Proxima, in FYROM which followed the successful completion of Operation Concordia. These operations have made significant contributions to peace and stability in their respective areas of operations. A work programme to progress ESDP by the incoming Irish Presidency was endorsed by the European Council held in Brussels at the end of the Italian Presidency. The programme covers the full spectrum of ESDP issues including conflict prevention and the civilian and military aspects of crisis management.</P>
        <P>My Department will progress this work programme at EU level using the established practice of formal and informal meetings up to and including ministerial level. An informal meeting of Defence Ministers of EU member states and accession countries is scheduled to take place in Brussels on 5 and 6 April 2004, while Defence Ministers will also meet in Brussels on 17 May in the framework of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Meetings at official level will be held as and when required.</P>
        <P>The Government intends that the same business-like professional approach, which characterised our previous EU Presidencies, will again be the hallmark of the conduct of the Presidency during the first half of 2004.</P>

	<P>The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power &mdash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State &mdash; is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in duties which include the escorts of cash in transit. Each cash escort would include deliveries to banks, post offices and other institutions.</P>
        <P>Statistical records compiled by my Department do not differentiate between banks, post offices and other institutions.</P>
        <P>The number of requests for cash escorts received by the military authorities from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the years 1999 to 2003 was as follows:  1999,  2,161; 2000, 2,285; 2001, 2,488; 2002, 2,516; 2003, 2,298.</P>
        <P>The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting movements of cash for the years 1999 to 2002 &mdash; the 2003 costs have not yet been finalised &mdash; including pay, allowances, transport, aerial surveillance and administration charge, was as follows: 1999, &euro;5.68m; 2000, &euro;5.99m; 2001, &euro;6.58; 2002, &euro;6.87m.</P>
        <P>Part of these costs is recouped from the banks through an annual contribution. A sum of &euro;2.86 million has been refunded by the banks to my Department each year since 1995. The contribution from the banks is designed to part cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. An annual contribution is also made to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, in the case of the Defence Forces, the contribution by the banks has generally covered the non-pay costs of providing such escorts. The matter is reviewed on an ongoing basis in my Department.</P>

	<P>On 1 July 2003 the Government agreed that Gormanston Camp, County Meath, would be among the State lands released to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.</P>
        <P>The intention is that this initiative will be targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market. The release of State lands under this initiative is a critical first step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing units.</P>
        <P>The modalities of the transfer of the property to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the quantity of land involved are under active consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 to 266, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>During the course of an exercise on the night of 27 November 2001, a number of live rounds of ammunition were accidentally discharged and a member of the Defence Forces received bullet wounds to his arm and chest. A military <Col N="402"/>ambulance was on site and the injured party was immediately treated by a qualified emergency medical technician before being transferred to Tallaght General Hospital and, subsequently, to St. James's Hospital, where he underwent treatment. Military police were immediately called to the scene and carried out a full investigation.</P>
        <P>Arising from the military police investigation, charges were preferred under section 168 of the Defence Act 1954, against four members of the Defence Forces, an officer, two NCOs and a private, who were involved in the planning and execution of the military exercise during which the incident occurred. I am advised by the military authorities that the matter was dealt with summarily in accordance with military law, which provides for due and fair process. All four were found guilty. Three were punished by way of a severe reprimand and one was given a warning.</P>
        <P>Where an incident involves injury to a member of the Defence Forces, a formal court of inquiry is convened to take evidence and to make recommendations as regards the matters referred to it. In this case, the court of inquiry has not been convened as the incident is currently the subject of a civil action in the courts. I am advised that, once the matter has been disposed of by the courts, a court of inquiry will be convened.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In the wake of the FMD crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system &mdash; the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcass and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control. In the latter regard, the FMD crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed. Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have however made it clear consistently that I am always willing to enhance NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.</P>
        <P>A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union was agreed at the December Council of Ministers. The system provides that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period all sheep are to be double tagged and identified individually, but all recording would be on a flock basis.</P>
        <P>The regime agreed by the December Council affords member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the interim period system, the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.</P><Col N="405"/>
        <Miles com="cl" par="105" />
        <P>I support the broad principle which underlies the agreed system. I have always been in favour of making use of new and efficient technologies to achieve this end, subject of course to practicalities and cost-effectiveness and I would be very anxious that Ireland and other member states would be in a position to move at the earliest possible date to an electronic system. In the interim, however, I believe that the system now in place and operating throughout the Irish sheep sector will continue to afford Ireland the level of protection and assurance in relation to both identification and traceability which I believe is strategically appropriate to this country.</P>
        <P>The package agreed by the December Council envisages the retention of systems such as NSIS, albeit with some minor adjustment, over the period leading up to EU-wide introduction of electronic individual identification. I have no plans to dismantle NSIS and roll back the progress which has been made in this area since 2001, only to see Irish sheep farmers, marts, meat processors, etc., being asked a few short years from now to once again re-instate and accommodate individual identification and traceability. However, I am willing to examine and address aspects relating to the operation of NSIS in so far as these are addressed within the EU system now agreed.</P>

	<P>The person named included a land parcel on his 2003 area aid application, which overlapped with a land parcel on another herdowner's application. Both parties were written to on this matter. It has now been determined that the person named was not entitled to claim area aid on this parcel. The person named claimed 62.04 hectares of forage but was only entitled to claim 57.09 hectares. Under the relevant EU regulation a penalty of double this difference was applied, as the difference was greater than 3%, which reduced the area determined for payment purposes to 47.19 hectares.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted two applications under the 2003 special beef premium scheme in respect of 60 animals. Both applications have been processed by my Department and 80% advance payment will issue very shortly.</P>
        <P>The person named had 58 animals slaughtered under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme, and has been paid advance payment on 33 animals. Advance payment in respect of the remaining 25 animals will issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The person named applied for premium on 22 animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. According to the terms and conditions of the scheme a producer may be paid premium on up to 1.8 reckonable livestock units only per hectare of the forage area of his or her holding as established from the producer's 2003 area aid application and any cattle submitted for 2003 suckler cow premium and special beef premium over and above that 1.8 reckonable livestock units limit shall not be paid such premium. The livestock units are calculated taking into account male cattle on which the producer applies for special beef premium, ewes submitted for 2003 ewe premium, notional dairy cows needed to produce any milk quota held and suckler cows or heifers for which suckler cow premium has been requested. The area aid record for the person named shows 47.19 hectares of forage area, which would allow payment on a maximum of 84.94 livestock units. The herdowner holds a milk quota of 131,681 litres and divided by the average yield of 3,982 litres would require 33.06 notional dairy cows to produce this. Applications from the herdowner for ewe premium on 4.35 livestock <Col N="407"/>units and beef premium for 36 livestock units have been processed leaving 11.53 livestock units due for payment under the suckler cow scheme. Payment of his 80% advance instalment for &euro;2,282.74 was made in respect of 12.73 animals. that is three heifers less than two years old, 1.80 livestock units and 9.73 cows. This payment issued on 9 January 2004.</P>

        <Quest>the reason consideration is being given to changing the availability of vaccines for cattle and sheep that have been available through licensed merchants for in excess of 30 years; the benefit he foresees by changing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>As licences in respect of animal vaccines, <Col N="409"/>which had been granted under the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932, no longer meet current scientific or EU legislative requirements, not least because a mandatory supply route was not specified, it was necessary to review all such licences on an individual basis. Under the review, which has been ongoing since 1999, the Irish Medicines Board has been progressively carrying out the detailed examination of application dossiers submitted by sponsoring companies. On this basis, the board makes a recommendation to my Department, as competent authority, for a final decision on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions, including route of supply, accompanying such licence.</P>
        <P>In terms of designating routes of supply for individual vaccines, my Department does not have a general approach which would as a matter of policy necessarily exclude any of the outlets provided for under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996. Rather, the decision is taken on the basis of the characteristics of each individual product taking account of the relevant recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board and the objective criteria laid down in Regulation 13 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996.</P>
        <P>In this context, I should point out that my Department has concluded a review of the existing legislation governing regulation of the Irish market in veterinary vaccines and other veterinary medicines taking account of experience of their operation for almost a decade, of various developments over that period and likely developments in the future. Arising from this, my Department is preparing to brief stakeholders within the next few weeks on the direction of the proposed changes to the existing regime, following which consultations with the animal remedies consultative committee will take place.</P>

	<P>Under the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, entitlements will be established for farmers who actively farmed during the three reference years, 2000, 2001 and 2002. In both instances outlined in the question, the farmers concerned were not actively farming during the reference period and consequently they will not have any entitlements established for them. They may, however, be able to apply for entitlements from the national reserve when it is established in autumn 2004. As the criteria under which national reserve entitlements are to be allocated <Col N="410"/>has not yet been established, it is not possible to say at this stage what their positions would be.</P>

	<P>The total amount spent on IT software licences by my Department in 2003 was &euro;4,365,503.53, of which &euro;468,410.00 was spent on products from the named company. This is the overall total for expenditure on new licences, <Col N="412"/>software version upgrades and annual maintenance and support.</P>
        <P>The product referred to is currently used in my Department to facilitate data transfer to and from an external partner. It is also used in a number of test areas. Other open-source products have been used where appropriate to enhance application functionality. Another open-source product is incorporated into the applications server software package that underpins the Department's new online business applications.</P>
        <P>My Department's procurement approach facilitates open competition, best value for money and best fit to the requirements. Evaluation of tenders received by my Department takes account of these factors. If a tender is based partly or fully on open-source software, it is evaluated in the same way. However, the use of open-source software does not always lead to cost savings. My Department continues to monitor the emerging IT industry standards including opportunities arising from open-source arrangements.</P>

As part of the Sustaining Progress agreement, the farm waste management scheme was revised with effect from 1 January 2004 by increasing the income units, IUs, for eligibility under the scheme from 200 IUs to 450 IUs; increasing the investment ceiling from &euro;50,790 to &euro;75,000; and introducing a standard grant rate of 40% for most investments.

	<P>Changes to payment rates and other aspects of the rural environment protection scheme will require an amendment to the CAP rural development plan and I have submitted the necessary proposals to the European Commission. These proposals provide for increased payment rates, in line with the Government commitment in Sustaining Progress, as follows: Up to 20ha: &euro;200/ha; 20ha &mdash; 40ha: &euro;175/ha; 40ha &mdash; 55ha: &euro;70/ha.</P>
        <P>Participation in REPS requires farmers to farm to a standard that goes beyond normal good farming practice. The scheme is open to all farmers who are prepared to assume such undertakings.</P>
        <P>Discussions on the proposals have already taken place between the Commission and officials of my Department. While the formal procedures of the Commission will to some extent determine how long it takes to secure approval for the changes, I will do everything possible to expedite matters and I will introduce the new scheme without delay once I have secured the Commission's approval.</P>

        <Quest>the criteria a person must meet to be eligible for a primary medical; the criteria there are for persons with multiple sclerosis to be eligible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the primary medical certificate that is required for application to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that the Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate. The medical criteria listed above applies to all applicants wishing to gain access to the scheme, including those with multiple sclerosis.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>the reason the grant for the disabled drivers scheme can only be applied to new forms of transport; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this excludes many people from this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the repayment of VRT is made on second hand vehicles as well as new ones. An individual who qualifies for the reliefs available under the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme is issued with a primary <Col N="415"/>medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate provides for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, VRT, plus a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle, plus a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of that vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from payment of annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group was established to review the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. The group examined all aspects of the scheme. I have received the report of the review group and it is currently being considered. Any recommendations contained in this report will receive full consideration.</P>
        <P>Any consideration of a change to the scheme will, among other factors, have to take account of any cost implications. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in, and desire to be admitted to, the scheme.</P>
        <P>The cost of reliefs, excluding annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;34 million in 2002, as compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994.</P>

        <P>As has already been stated in response to earlier questions, sanction has been received in principle for a rescheduling of the total funding of &euro;4.7 million approved in respect of the implementation of the management plan.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>the reasons tax relief may not be availed of in instances where the lessee of land for farming is related to the landowner.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2279/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of the first &euro;5,079 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five <Col N="416"/>years and in respect of &euro;7,618 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
        <P>In budget 2004, I announced that this 55 age limit is to be lowered to 40 with effect from 1 January 2004 and the amount of exempt income for leases of between five and seven years is to be increased from &euro;5,079 to &euro;7,500 per annum and from &euro;7,618 to &euro;10,000 for leases of seven or more years.</P>
        <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant. This restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale. For these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons.</P>

The implementation plan will <Col N="417"/>address issues such as sequencing of various moves, acquisition/financing of new offices, associated rationalisation of Government property, scope for pooling common services between Departments and the major human resource issues that will need to be addressed. Pending completion of the plan, it has been decided not to conduct a survey of the staff of the Department in relation to decentralisation.</P>

	<P>Department of Finance Circular 7/99: Civil Servants as Candidates for Local Authority Elections sets out the rules governing civil servants who wish to consider standing for election to local authorities. The Minister for Finance is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants, including the rules on seeking election to local authorities and on involvement in politics generally by civil servants.</P>
        <P>The Meteorological Office and the Central Statistics Office are an integral part of the Civil Service. The staff who work in these two Government offices are civil servants and as such, the rules regarding civil servants standing as candidates in local authority elections, as stated in Circular 7/99, apply to them as they do to civil servants in Departments-offices generally.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will note that staff in some grades in the Civil Service can stand in local elections. Under the terms of Circular 7/99 the position as regards the candidature of civil servants for election to local authorities is as follows: State industrial employees and civil servants in manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades may stand for election to local authorities; civil servants in clerical grades and in non-manipulative and sub-professional grades in similar salary ranges may stand as candidates at local elections, subject to the condition that the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of a particular Department, declare that officers engaged in a particular category of work may not so stand; and all other civil servants remain completely barred from standing for election. However, this rule does not apply to a civil servant who holds a position which, after 17 May 1974, has been upgraded through the general restructuring of his or her grade and as a result of which carries a salary maximum above that of clerical officer.</P>
        <P>These rules do not apply to personal assistants and special advisers in Minister's offices. The Minister has no plans to amend Circular 7/99 regarding civil servants as candidates for local authority elections.</P>

        <P>Locations for a further 1,300 or so jobs will be identified at a later stage. As I said in my budget speech, I believe that the total number of posts to be relocated should be closer to 12,000 and I will examine further options in this regard once the programme is well under way.</P>

        <Quest>if separate income to spouses arising from maintenance payments or from pension splitting in a separation, attract more favourable tax treatment than if these incomes remained in the hands of a one-earner couple; and his views on whether this breaches the principle established in a case (details supplied).</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The tax treatment of separated spouses relative to that which would apply in the case of a married one-earner couple who remain married depends on the circumstances which apply in each case and it is not possible to generalise in the abstract.</P>
        <P>However, it may be useful to set out in broad terms the position with regard to the tax <Col N="424"/>treatment of separated persons. While, in general, separated couples are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, they may, where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place. However, the election to be treated for tax purposes as if married is not a right of one spouse but rather is a joint election of both spouses.</P>
        <P>The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that where the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his or her spouse is granted to the paying spouse but the payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse. However, if the couple jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place, then the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, non-legally binding maintenance payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse but the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse. The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</P>
        <P>As regards pension splitting, the facts and circumstances of any particular case would have to be examined to determine whether part of one spouse's pension payable to the other spouse is a legally binding or non-legally binding maintenance payment for the benefit of that other spouse.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Murphy case to which the Deputy refers in the details supplied, the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional to treat a married two earner couple less favourably for tax purposes than two single persons living together and on identical incomes to the married couple. In my view, the tax arrangements relating to separated spouses do not breach the principle established in the Murphy case.</P>

        <Quest>if tax relief is available to family members for the cost of providing both maintenance and treatment in a nursing home of elderly parents or relatives or family members; and at what rate this relief is available.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax relief, under the heading of health expenses, is available to family members in respect of the cost of providing maintenance and treatment in a nursing home of elderly parents or relatives or family members provided that the nursing home is an approved home for the purposes of the <Col N="425"/>relief. A full list of nursing homes approved for these purposes is available on the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie,</i> as is a full explanatory leaflet on the tax relief relating to health expenses.</P>
        <P>The tax relief in respect of unreimbursed health expenses is granted at an individual's marginal, or highest, rate of tax. Tax relief cannot be claimed for the first &euro;125 of the health expenses incurred in any tax year where the claim relates to an individual. If relief is claimed in respect of more than one person, relief cannot be claimed on the first &euro;250 of the health expenses incurred.</P>
        <P>I might point out to the Deputy that over the last several years I considerably widened the scope of medical expenses relief and I removed a number of the restrictions that applied. For example, in the Finance Act 2001, I simplified the relief by removing the requirement that the taxpayer must be in receipt of the dependent relative allowance, now a credit, to claim relief in respect of their dependent relative. In addition, in the Finance Act 2002, I extended the list of qualifying dependants beyond immediate family. The relief can now be claimed in respect of a range of other relatives, persons aged 65 or over whether relatives or not, and persons of any age who are permanently incapacitated.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many senior citizens on the lower tax band are receiving a lesser tax rebate in respect of their waste charges than taxpayers on the higher rate and consequently paying higher waste charges; and if he will consider a different approach to correct this anomaly on behalf of senior citizens.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The current tax relief for waste service charges is provided by granting a relief to taxpayers based on the charges they have paid to local authorities and private operators in the previous year, provided of course that they have actually paid the relevant amount and on time. Where an annual charge applies, the full payment is subject to tax relief at the standard rate, regardless of the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Where charges for refuse collection are based on a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; system, a flat rate charge of &euro;195 per annum is assumed and tax relief is granted on that basis at the standard rate.</P>
        <P>I understand that a local authority may, on the grounds of personal hardship, waive all or a portion of a charge made by it for the collection of household waste or, where the collection of such waste is undertaken by the private sector, may subsidise the fee payable. The collection of household waste, and the imposition of refuse charges and appropriate exercise of statutory waiver provision in this regard, are matters for each local authority.</P><Col N="426"/>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The benchmarking body was established under the terms of the PPF to undertake a fundamental examination of public service pay and jobs <i>vis-a-vis</i> the private sector. The awards recommended by the body applied to the public service grades examined and to those agreed grades which had a corresponding link.</P>
        <P>As a commercial State company, An Post is not comprehended within the terms of the benchmarking process and consequently its staff is not entitled to benefit from the awards recommended by the body. The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 states that conditions applying to staff would be no less favourable than those which applied prior to their transfer. This was to ensure there was no worsening of conditions for existing staff due to the transfer. However, it did not confer Civil Service status in perpetuity to all An Post staff.</P>
        <P>As a commercial State company pay and conditions are set by agreement between management and unions as happens in other commercial enterprises. There have been a number of collective agreements since 1983. The application of pay increases in commercial State companies is primarily a matter for the company itself and I have no function in this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 to 323, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are two ways in which a taxpayer may have been in breach of the amnesty. First, by making a declaration in which he or she did not comply with the terms or, second, where a declaration was not made but was required to be made.</P>
        <P>The amnesty legislation, Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993 prohibits access by revenue auditors or investigators to the declarations made by taxpayers, consequently it is not possible to examine the declarations to establish whether they are in breach of the terms of the amnesty. Persons who made an incorrect declaration to the chief special collector would normally only be discovered during the course of a revenue audit or investigation, if the amnesty declaration is produced to the auditor or investigator.</P>
        <P>The amnesty legislation also provides that a revenue officer requires the consent of the appeal commissioners to make further inquiries into a case where it is suspected that the declaration is incorrect. Approximately 20 such applications have been made to the appeal commissioners and consent has been given in about one third of these cases to date. Some cases have been investigated with the agreement of the taxpayers.</P>
        <P>No convictions have been secured in court in the categories set out in section 9(1)(<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>)(I) and (II). I understand, however, that in one case there is a prosecution before the courts under amnesty legislation on behalf of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 327 together.</P>
        <P>Discussions to determine the safety features to be included in the flood relief scheme have been taking place with the local authorities and representatives of the various local water safety and water based sporting groups. Arising out of these discussions a comprehensive report itemising the safety measures was produced by the OPW's engineering consultants in July 2003 and a copy was forwarded in the same month to the water safety &mdash; water-based group's representative. It is expected that the final observations of the water safety and water based interest groups on the safety report will be confirmed and clarified in the immediate future. A meeting of all relevant parties has been arranged for Tuesday, 27 January 2004 in Kilkenny. Instructions can then be given to the contractor to put in place a work programme to implement the necessary measures as quickly as possible. I wish to assure the Deputies that this work programme will include the appropriate safety provisions to counteract all the potential dangers to safety that have been identified.</P>
        <Miles com="cl" par="105" />
        <P>One item which has presented some difficulty is the proposed location of a slipway at the Peace <Col N="429"/>Park to meet the needs of the boating clubs and also the emergency services. Various complicating factors including the possible costly disruption of numerous public utilities, local authority proposals for a footbridge across the Nore at this point and various existing outfalls which empty into the river at this area have all combined to present difficulties. Various alternative sites for a slipway were identified by the OPW's consulting engineers but were not acceptable to the local groups. The OPW has, however, instructed the consultants to re-examine the proposal for the provision of a slipway at the Peace Park and the consultants' report is expected very shortly.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate incident reported in the newspaper article was not brought to the OPW's attention prior to publication. The flood relief construction site in Kilkenny is a secure one but, nevertheless, it is virtually impossible to prevent someone gaining access to the river, if they are determined to do so, either from the bridges or by scaling the existing barriers. While the river levels have been artificially lowered during the construction works, the levels and current can still rise quickly in adverse conditions and will always constitute a potentially dangerous environment. The scheme is still under construction and the installation of safety features such as ladders, grab chains, rings etc. will be commenced in the near future as part of the programme of ongoing phased works.</P>
        <P>When completed by the end of 2004, the Kilkenny flood relief scheme will have a significant positive impact on the city through reducing or eliminating adverse flooding impacts and this will result in very real benefits for Kilkenny. At the same time, the finished scheme will include all the appropriate provisions for safety deemed necessary. In accordance with the Safety Health and Welfare (Construction) Regulations, a health and safety file will also be completed for the works and copies passed to the OPW and Kilkenny County Council. The health and safety file will identify operational and maintenance requirements and limitations or restrictions that are imposed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The purchase of a pendant alarm system and its monitoring, are subject to the standard rate of 21%. The installation of such a system, where it includes the purchase of such an alarm, is generally subject to the reduced rate of 13.5%.</P>
        <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero-rated before 1 January 1991, the purchase, installation or monitoring services for such alarms do not fall within this category. Since we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT, we cannot therefore relieve such services as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I would add that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 15) Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Applicants should contact the Revenue Commissioners, VAT repayments (unregistered section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
        <P>I understand that a scheme of community support for older people is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once off cost of purchase and installation of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and security <Col N="432"/>lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as pendant alarms, which are operated via the telephone and are worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
        <P>Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, I understand that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees.</P>

        <Quest>if he accepts the case made by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group in relation to the &euro;18 million VAT bill payable by charities on their inputs, which cannot be reclaimed because of their exempted status; if he will consider a mechanism for refund; if he will reduce the minimum donation threshold for tax purposes to &euro;100, and widen the definition of relevant donations to cover gifts of assets as well as cash.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1813/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I should firstly explain that charities and non-profit groups are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive. This means that they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. I am aware of the recent report commissioned by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group which indicates that charities incur a VAT bill of &euro;18 million on their inputs.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide a mechanism for a refund of such VAT. The cost of such a refund would be expensive, especially as there would be pressure to extend such a scheme to charities not represented by the ICTRG and to other non-profit organisations. Indeed, such a system could encourage registration as charities by other organisations to benefit from such funding. In addition, I would point out that Government subventions to affected organisations cover a significant element of the VAT incurred.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in the Finance Act 2001, I introduced a new section and schedule into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for a uniform scheme of tax relief for donations which, as well as introducing new reliefs for donations to domestic charities and educational institutions, merged almost all of the existing reliefs under the umbrella of a single scheme. This initiative was widely welcomed by the charitable sector.</P>
        <P>Given the very generous nature of the relief, which was only introduced in 2001, as well as the fact that donations can be cumulative, as little as approximately &euro;5 per week over the course of a year, I consider that it would be premature to make any change to the minimum donation threshold of &euro;250 now.</P>
        <P>Under existing legislation, donations must be in the form of money in order to attract tax relief. However, where an asset is donated to an eligible charity, the donation for capital gains tax <Col N="433"/>purposes is deemed to be such that neither a gain not a loss accrues to the donor on the disposal. Therefore, no tax charge arises in respect of such a donation and any gain on a subsequent disposal of the asset by the charity shall not be a chargeable gain provided it is for charitable purposes only. Thus, I believe there are already generous reliefs in this area for charities.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>If tax concessions were introduced for older persons wishing to trade down, it would have the effect of increasing the supply of larger &mdash; and generally more expensive &mdash; houses relative to demand. This would be of benefit to people at the top end of the market. However, the demand for property relative to supply at the lower end of the market would increase and this would adversely affect first-time buyers, in particular, who would have to compete for such houses with a larger number of people consequently. Persons trading down normally have the cash upfront to pay for smaller houses and would have no stamp duty liability on a new house or a small liability on a second hand property.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that people trading down can already avail of the principal private residence relief which is a substantial exemption from capital gains tax. If the house has been occupied for the full period of ownership, full exemption applies. Otherwise, the relief granted is in proportion to the period of occupation over the entire period of ownership. This relief, combined with the capital sum received on the sale, means that most older people with large homes already have sufficient financial incentive to trade down.</P>
        <P>I consider these reliefs to be sufficiently generous and appropriate and accordingly, I have no plans to introduce further concessions for any category of individual wishing to trade down.</P>

	<P>The most recent available information for non-industrial civil servants indicates that around 17% are under the age of 30, about 7% are between the ages of 55 and 59 and just under 3.5% are between the ages of 60 and 65. Excluded from these figures are certain numbers serving in the Irish Prison Service, Garda civilian staff and local recruits working abroad for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Similar information in regard to the wider public sector is not centrally maintained.</P>

	<P>The number of middle management posts covers the grades of administrative officer, higher executive officer, assistant principal and principal officer. The scheme in existence for filling vacancies in these grades within the civil service is an interdepartmental competition using a one in three ratio. Under this scheme, every third vacancy falling to be filled is referred to the Civil Service Commissioners to be filled from the Civil Service-wide interdepartmental competitions. The other two vacancies are filled from within the Department. A candidate who is successful in an interdepartmental competition may fill a vacancy in his or her own department.</P>
        <P>In addition, all new principal officer posts are filled from the interdepartmental panel and also those posts that arise as a consequence of the former occupant of the post taking up appointment at assistant secretary level or higher in a department other than his/her parent department.</P>
        <P>Table 1 sets out the position regarding the number of middle management posts in the civil service which have been filled by candidates in these interdepartmental competitions. No vacancies have been filled by candidates outside the civil service in the grades of higher executive officer, HEO, assistant principal, AP and principal officer, PO.</P><Col N="435"/>

	<P>I have not undertaken a survey of civil servants in the grades referred to by the Deputy to ascertain the numbers who wish to transfer to each of the locations included in the decentralisation programme. This is something which, no doubt, the implementation committee chaired by Mr. Flynn will be considering in drawing up its proposed implentation plan. My own view is that conducting such a survey in advance of clearer <Col N="438"/>timelines for the sequencing of all the various moves would be of limited value.</P>
        <P>More generally, I believe that the very scale of the programme, including as it does a wide mix of locations all around the country, should help to attract volunteers. There are thousands of public servants commuting daily to Dublin, some from the immediate neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath but many others from even further away. The decentralisation programme offers these people the prospect of a significantly improved quality of life by providing work much closer to home. In these cases people can simply change their commuting habits by engaging in reverse commuting and reducing their time on the roads each morning and evening.</P>
        <P>For many others, there is the opportunity to relocate away from Dublin altogether and to start a new life outside the capital. Those who doubt that there will be sufficient interest often refer to difficulties experienced in attracting sufficient numbers to particular locations previously. My view is that the single biggest impediment to encouraging sufficient numbers to relocate previously was the prospect of not being able to fulfil their career prospects. This impediment has now been removed. I believe that every individual who joins the civil service is entitled to aspire to becoming Secretary General one day. The new programme means this can become a real aspiration for staff serving outside Dublin</P>

Some six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
        <P LI="1">b) persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>
        <P LI="1">c) persons without both hands or without both arms;</P>
        <P LI="1">d) persons without one or both legs;</P>
        <P LI="1">e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and</P>
        <P LI="1">f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria as set out above is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate provides for remission or <Col N="441"/>repayment of vehicle registration tax &mdash; VRT &mdash; plus a repayment of value added tax &mdash; VAT &mdash; on the purchase of the vehicle, plus a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of that vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle, and exemption from payment of annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for.</P>
        <P>Any consideration of a change to the scheme, will among other factors, have to take account of any cost implications. I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The cost of reliefs excluding annual road tax costs is estimated to be in the region of &euro;34 million in 2002, as compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994.</P>

	<P>Following the initial announcement in budget 2000 that the Government intended to proceed with a new programme of decentralisation, one major public service union, the Civil and Public Services Union, provided advice on the development of criteria for the programme. The CPSU suggested that selection criteria should take account of factors such as the following: socio-economic considerations; known staff preferences; availability of education and hospital facilities; the need to build sustainable promotional structures at a regional level but also avoid a detrimental impact on promotion opportunities for staff remaining in Dublin; the inclusion of senior level posts; the advantages of including locations in the vicinity of Dublin; and the need to maintain service to the public. I was appreciative of the submission made by the CPSU at that time and I consider that the programme announced in budget 2004 takes full account of the points raised in the submission.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 and 353 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish language has the status of a &ldquo;Treaty language&rdquo;  in the European Union. This derives from the fact that the treaties are in Irish and that Irish is listed as one of the languages in which the text is authentic. Each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the eleven other languages, with the texts in Irish being equally authentic and having equal status with those in all other languages. The draft constitutional treaty under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference would fully maintain this position.</P>
        <P>Irish is not one of the official and working languages of the institutions of the Union as provided for in Article 1 of Regulation 1/1958. However, the Government continues to monitor developments with a view to availing of any appropriate opportunity which may arise to enhance the status of Irish in relation to the EU. For instance, under revised staff regulations, which are due to be agreed shortly, and as a result of an initiative by Ireland, a new requirement for officials to demonstrate before their first promotion the ability to work in a third language extends not only to official and working languages but also to Irish. In this regard, Irish is the only language that is not an official and working language which will be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The Government remains fully willing to build on the advances made and to take further practical steps as appropriate. To this end, there are ongoing discussions between my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I very much hope these discussions will result in the identification of additional opportunities to enhance the status of Irish in the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has been providing assistance to Irish emigrants in Britain and the United States for many years. In response to concerns about the situation of Irish emigrants in Britain, the Government established the D&iacute;on committee in 1984. The D&iacute;on fund, which is administered by the embassy in London through the D&iacute;on committee, has almost trebled over the past four years &mdash; from &euro;592,300 in 1999 to &euro; 2,573,000 last year. A further &euro;150,000 was allocated to the Federation of Irish Societies in London from savings in last year's budget. This brings the total allocation to emigrant services in the UK to &euro;2,723,000 in 2003. The total amount allocated by the D&iacute;on committee since 1984 is almost &euro;18 million.</P>
        <P>The Government also gives grants, through the Vote for Foreign Affairs, to voluntary organisations in the US who provide advocacy and support to Irish immigrants. Priority is given to the provision of information, advice and outreach services for Irish immigrants. The grants are used for funding the administration of such services. My Department provided a total of &euro;300,000 in 2003, which represents a substantial increase over previous years.</P>
        <P>I am particularly conscious of the difficulties faced by elderly Irish emigrants and they are one of the priority groups for assistance from the funds provided by my Department. The Government also recognises that many emigrants would like to return to live in Ireland but that some of them, particularly elderly people, require special assistance to do so. For the past three years, the D&iacute;on committee has funded the salaries of workers in two organisations which provide advice and assistance to elderly Irish people in Britain who wish to return to live in Ireland &mdash;&ldquo;Aisling&rdquo; Return to Ireland project in Camden and the &ldquo;Safe Home&rdquo; programme in Mulranny, County Mayo.</P>
        <P>In addition, the terms of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme administered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, provide that up to 25% of accommodation in new projects undertaken by voluntary bodies throughout the country, assisted under the scheme, may be allocated to elderly emigrants returning to this country.</P>
        <P>Irish emigrants have made an enormous contribution to the development of this country and it was in recognition of this contribution that the Government agreed with the social partners, in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to establish the task force on policy regarding emigrants. The focus of the task force and of their report was directed towards protecting and supporting those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. I welcomed the task force's report, which sets the issue of emigration in a forward looking context and provides a <Col N="444"/>template for addressing the needs of the Irish abroad in the future.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to announce before Christmas that I secured an additional provision of &euro;1 million in the Estimates for my Department for this year for services to emigrants. I intend that the additional funds will be concentrated on improving services for the more vulnerable among our emigrants in the UK, US and Australia who require special assistance and support. I also intend that priority will be given to services for elderly people, including those who wish to return to live in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The case referred to by the Deputy has been raised with the Chinese authorities. In a declaration issued in January 2003, the European Union expressed its concern regarding this case, urged the Chinese authorities to review it and expressed its expectation that the death sentence would not be upheld.</P>
        <P>In addition, the case has been raised with the Chinese authorities in the context of the EU-China human rights dialogue and is subject to ongoing discussions with the Chinese authorities in the framework of this dialogue. The dialogue was established in 1996 in order to provide a platform for engagement with China on human rights issues, allowing the EU to channel human rights concerns, including individual cases, directly to the Chinese authorities. The next session of the dialogue will take place next month. The individual to whom the Deputy refers will remain on the EU's list of individual cases, which will be presented to the Chinese authorities for discussion at the February dialogue session.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet, I refer the Deputy to my previous replies of 6 November, 2 December and 6 December 2003 and to exchanges in the House on 11 December 2003. These replies stated that in March 2002, the Dalai Lama wrote to the Foreign Ministers of EU member states, including myself, asking that an EU special representative for Tibet be appointed. In a joint response at that time, EU Ministers were unanimously of the view that nominating an EU special representative would not contribute positively to the situation.</P>
        <P>This position was reconsidered at the end of last year and it was decided the position had not changed. It remains the common view of EU partners therefore that, in present circumstances, <Col N="445"/>the most effective means of influencing the Chinese Government's position on Tibet is through direct contact.</P>

	<P>The Department has been working closely with other Departments to develop, co-ordinate and carry out the programme for Ireland's EU Presidency. The Presidency programme was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas last December and was debated in the House on 20 January. The priorities for the Irish Presidency are to take forward work on the draft constitutional treaty; to ensure a smooth transition to a Union of 25 member states on 1 May and carry forward work on the wider enlargement process; to give renewed impetus to the Union's programme of economic, social and environmental reform; to advance the area of freedom, justice and security; and to carry out effectively the Union's international obligations, including in regard to development issues. The Department of Foreign Affairs is also actively involved in planning and logistical arrangements for the meetings that will take place in Ireland and elsewhere, as well as the organisation of sponsorship and management of the Presidency website.</P>
        <P>During the Presidency Irish officials, including many from the Department of Foreign Affairs, will be called on to chair approximately 3,000 meetings in Brussels, Ireland and elsewhere. The majority of these meetings are working groups at official level which meet in order to progress the Union's agenda across the range of its activities. The calendar of Council meetings, which I and other Government colleagues will chair, has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library, as has the calendar of high level meetings which are being held in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I will host an informal EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Tullamore on 16-17 April 2004. I will also host a meeting of the ASEM Foreign Ministers, which brings together EU Ministers and their Asian counterparts in April in Ireland and an informal euromed foreign ministerial, which provides an opportunity for dialogue between EU Foreign Ministers and their Mediterranean counterparts on 6-7 May 2004 in Dublin Castle. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, will host an international conference on HIV-AIDS in Europe in Dublin Castle on 23-25 February 2004 and a development co-operation ministerial meeting in Dublin on 1 June 2004. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, will host a conference of Ministers for European Affairs on <Col N="446"/>communicating Europe in Wicklow on 7-8 April 2004. The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the organisation and management of these meetings.</P>
        <P>In addition, I will participate in ministerial troika meetings with, among others, the US, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Croatia, Albania, Serbia and Montenegro, New Zealand, the African Union and ECOWAS. I have had a successful meeting in Ireland with the Foreign Minister of Australia. I recently visited the Middle East and held discussions on the Middle East peace process in Israel and in Egypt. I attended the inauguration of the new President of Georgia, Mikhila Saakashvili, in Tbilisi last weekend.</P>
        <P>Work on the Presidency programme is being advanced through these meetings as well as through a wide range of bilateral contacts between Ministers and officials with their counterparts in the member states and other countries and with the EU institutions.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work at the Department's headquarters and the permanent representation in Brussels, our other missions abroad also have important Presidency responsibilities. Our missions in third countries, for example, will chair meetings of the EU member state representatives in their countries of accreditation and will act on behalf of the EU in relations with their host Governments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a very substantial increase in the number of passports issued in recent years. The passport offices in Dublin and Cork issued 467,653 passports last year which is more than double the number issued as recently as 1996. A number of factors have given rise to the increase in passport demand over recent years. These include an increase in the population in the State, a substantial rise in the number of people travelling abroad, due to higher disposable incomes and cheaper airfares, and a rise in the number of children being issued with individual passports.</P>
        <P>Almost 90% of passports are issued within ten working days which compares very favourably with the level of service available internationally. I am satisfied with the level of staff resources available in my Department to meet the demand for passports. The Passport Office currently employs almost 200 permanent staff at its offices in Dublin and Cork. These are supplemented by temporary staff on a seasonal basis as required. Overall staffing numbers have been increased in <Col N="447"/>recent years and are continually kept under review.</P>
        <P>The technical systems for processing passport applications have, however, reached the limits of their capacity and are urgently in need of replacement. The passport office is currently engaged in a major project to modernise the passport issuing service. The project will streamline the process of issuing passports and enable a more efficient service to be provided to the public. A new, more secure passport booklet will be introduced when the new system is implemented later this year. When completed, Ireland will have one of the most advanced passport issuing systems in the world.</P>

	<P>The human rights committee, composed of 18 independent experts of recognised competence in the field of human rights, monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee was established when the covenant entered into force in 1976. The first optional protocol, which entered into force together with the covenant, authorises the committee to consider also allegations from individuals concerning violations of their civil and political rights. Ireland ratified both the covenant and optional protocol on 8 December 1989 and it entered into force in Ireland shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>In response to a petition under the first optional protocol in April 2001, the committee found Ireland had violated the rights of the person concerned. Ireland responded to the views-findings of the committee in August 2001. Ireland informed the committee that, in acknowledgement of the views of the committee and its obligations under the covenant, it proposed to pay 1,000 to the author of the petition.</P>
        <P>The special rapporteur of the human rights committee on views, Mr. Nisuke Ando, presented a report for information to the committee on follow up to cases where a violation of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has been found. In his report on this case he recommended <Col N="448"/>to the committee that he arrange a meeting with Ireland as the state party.</P>
        <P>In response to a request from Mr. Ando, an officer of the permanent mission of Ireland to the UN in Geneva met with Mr. Ando on 4 November 2003. At the meeting, Mr. Ando recalled the background to the case and asked the representative of Ireland if Ireland had any additional information on the case. In response the representative of Ireland stated that he had no additional information on the case. It was noted, <i>inter alia</i>, that the findings of the HRC in the case had been considered by the committee to review the operation of the Offences against the State Acts and related matters. Mr. Ando will report on his meeting with the representative of Ireland to the next meeting of the human rights committee at its 80th session, which is scheduled from 15 March to 2 April 2004 in New York.</P>

	<P>Ireland is one of the 27 countries that participate in the US visa waiver programme, which enables citizens of those countries to travel to the US for up to 90 days without a visa for business or tourist purposes. The US Enhanced Border Security Act, enacted after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, requires each country that participates in the visa waiver programme to introduce, or have in place a programme to introduce, biometric passports by 26 October 2004. Otherwise, citizens of these countries will have to obtain a visa from an American Embassy for travel to the US. This, however, will only apply to passports issued on or after 26 October 2004; holders of passports issued before that date will continue to be able to enter the US under the visa waiver programme without a visa, provided their passports are machine-readable, that is, the personal information is printed and not handwritten. All Irish passports issued in Dublin, Cork and London are machine-readable.</P>
        <P>Given the numbers of Irish travellers to the US and the importance of our economic and wider relationship with that country, it is highly desirable that Ireland should remain a participant in the visa waiver programme. I am recommending to the Government, therefore, that Ireland should introduce passports containing biometric information subject to the conduct of a feasibility study of the detailed arrangements for implementing this.</P>
        <P>My Department is developing a new Irish passport which will be introduced later this year. The new passport will contain a polycarbonate, plastic, datapage which will be capable of incorporating a microchip on which biometric data can be inserted. It will, accordingly, be <Col N="449"/>possible to move relatively quickly to the stage of producing biometric passports if a final decision to this effect is taken by the Government.</P>

	<P>On 7 January 2004, the President of the United States announced a new immigration initiative, entitled fair and secure immigration reform. Under the initiative, the President is proposing the creation of a new form of temporary work permit which would be available to both undocumented foreign nationals currently in the US and those seeking to enter with a job arranged.</P>
        <P>The temporary work permit would give such people legal status in the US for three years, with the possibility of renewal. Recipients of these permits would be able to apply for permanent residence in the US but would not get preference over other green card applicants. Workers who did not qualify for permanent residency status when their temporary work permits expired would have to return to their country of origin.</P>
        <P>While the proposal does not ensure permanent legal status for the undocumented in the US, it does offer the possibility of a temporary status which will enable them to work, with the accompanying employment rights and social benefits. Importantly, it gives these workers the right to leave the US during the period of the temporary work permit, and return again.</P>
        <P>The President's proposals will have to be approved by the US Congress and it is too early to say what amendments may be made in the course of their passage through the congress. Nevertheless, I welcome this initiative which represents an important first step in addressing the situation of undocumented foreign workers in a pragmatic and compassionate way.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the embassy in Washington DC will follow closely the development of the President's initiative and the consideration given to it in the US Congress. It will, in particular, continuously assess the potential of the proposals to regulate the status of Irish citizens in the US who remain undocumented.</P>

	<P>The family of Se&aacute;n Brown lodged its complaints with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland in March 2001 about the police investigation into his murder. Her report was published on 19 January 2004 and it identified a number of serious faults about the manner in which the police handled the investigation and responded to her own inquiry. Mrs. O'Loan has upheld two complaints from Mr. Brown's family &mdash; that the investigation into his death had not been efficiently carried out and that no earnest effort was made to identify those who carried out his murder.</P>
        <P>On the basis of her findings that the RUC investigation was incomplete and inadequate, she has recommended that a full independent review should be carried out into the murder. The PSNI has agreed to a re-investigation of the case and to keep the Brown family fully informed of all developments.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have taken a personal interest in the family's efforts and have raised this issue on several occasions with the British Government. In pursuit of this, I raised the disturbing findings of the Ombudsman's report and my support for her key recommendation of a full independent review into the murder with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, and with the PSNI Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Farmleigh House last Thursday.</P>
        <P>The re-investigation of the Brown murder will be closely watched not only by the family but also by the public and the ombudsman herself. Se&aacute;n Brown was an upstanding member of his community and a victim of sectarian evil. I share the family's hope that the new investigation will provide evidence to convict those responsible for the murder of their father and husband.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I set out the Government's position with regard to the Falun Gong organisation on a number of <Col N="452"/>occasions last year. Falun Gong was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999 and the Chinese government continues to regard it as an &ldquo;evil cult&rdquo;. However, the Government takes seriously concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members.</P>
        <P>This issue has been raised both bilaterally and through European Union channels, notably through the formal framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which was established in 1996. Through the dialogue, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally, and more specifically with respect to the freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on individual practitioners of Falun Gong. The next session of the EU-China human rights dialogue will take place next month.</P>
        <P>Human rights are a constant and important issue of dialogue and discussion with the Chinese authorities, at both national and European Union level. In this regard, I welcome the confirmation of continued commitment to the human rights dialogue in China's first ever policy paper on the EU, which was published in September 2003, and the reiteration by both sides, at the most recent EU-China Summit in Beijing on 30 October 2003, of their continued commitment to work towards achieving more meaningful and positive results on the ground.</P>
        <P>The specific cases to which the Deputy refers involve Chinese citizens. They are subject to Chinese law while in that country. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular function in this matter.</P>

	<P>Conscious of the success of the sponsorship arrangements in recent Presidencies, and that this has very much become the usual practice, the Government took the view that the Presidency offers a valuable and important opportunity for Irish business to promote what is best about Ireland, in particular in the economic, trade and tourism areas.</P>
        <P>The main role of the Presidency is to advance the agenda of the European Union but it is also accepted that each Presidency takes the opportunity to promote its own country widely. It would be remiss of the Government if it did not maximise the exposure that Ireland will gain from hosting the Presidency, which may well be the last of its kind. Sponsorship will help develop a wider ownership in, and involvement with, the Presidency.</P><Col N="453"/>
        <P>We have, in particular, modelled our approach on that applied by the very successful Danish Presidency by inviting offers of sponsorship from companies. All sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services &mdash; no cash sponsorship will be considered.</P>
        <P>A number of categories lend themselves to a sponsorship arrangement &mdash; transportation, catering and the provision of IT-telecommunications equipment. Similar categories have been sponsored during previous Presidencies. In this context, my Department contacted the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland, such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities.</P>
        <P>I am happy that the following companies have agreed to become sponsors of the Presidency: Eircom, Audi, Tipperary Natural Spring Water and Kerrygold. Eircom and Audi between them will supply goods and services worth approximately &euro;5 million. Tipperary Natural Spring Water will supply its product free of charge at all ministerial level meetings in Ireland and for the two summits in Brussels, while Kerrygold will supply its products free of charge for every Presidency lunch and dinner in Ireland and in Brussels. It is difficult, at this stage, to give an indication of the precise value of these sponsorships.</P>
        <P>Such is the interest in sponsoring the Presidency that negotiations are still ongoing with several similar high calibre companies. I am also encouraged by the inquiries from smaller regional companies and organisations who are interested in sponsoring events in their respective localities. This shows the Presidency touches many parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, when negotiations are complete, not only will the cost of hosting the Presidency be significantly reduced but there will be a framework in place which will maximise the exposure of Irish companies and products to a wider European and international audience. This can only be of benefit to the country. Prior to entering these sponsorship agreements, all offers of sponsorship were, and continue to be, presented to the interdepartmental Presidency planning group, under the chairmanship of my Department, for consideration.</P>

This resolution was sponsored by Ireland and our partners in the European Union and demands that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around east Jerusalem, which is in departure of the armistice line of 1949 and is in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law.</P>
        <P>I visited Israel and Egypt for discussions on 14-18 January and intend visiting the region again later in the Presidency. As European Union representative in the international quartet, Ireland will attach a high priority to advancing the road map. During my talks in Israel, I suggested that small, concrete and visible steps should be taken by both sides to restore trust and revive the peace process. I also raised the question of the separation barrier. I reiterated our concern about the building of such a structure in the occupied Palestinian territories and made the point also to Israeli interlocutors that it did not serve Israel's long-term security interests.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 373 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Government's recently announced decentralisation programme, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs is scheduled for decentralisation to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 130 posts.</P>
        <P>A decentralisation committee has been set up within the Department to liaise with the Government decentralisation committee, to plan and implement the decentralisation programme and to assess the impact of the move on the work of the Department. A number of important questions relating to decentralisation remain to be clarified. The timing of the move will be a central issue, in particular. In this context we wish to give staff as much information as possible on these aspects prior to asking them to indicate whether they wish to decentralise to Limerick or to the other 52 centres. The content of the central implementation plan report, to be prepared by the implementation committee for the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation by the end of March, will be of particular relevance in this regard. I anticipate the Department of Foreign Affairs will conduct a decentralisation survey shortly after the presentation of this report. The results of the survey will, when available, be made known to the Department of Finance, unions and staff.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in addition to a passport office in Cork and a new passport facility being established in Balbriggan, this Department also has 67 resident diplomatic and consular missions abroad, with which Dublin-based staff liaise on a daily basis, by e-mail, fax and telephone and video conference facility. The decision to relocate the development co-operation directorate to Limerick does not, therefore, pose an insurmountable problem for the efficient and effective operation of the Department in general or the directorate itself in particular. It will pose certain managerial and coherence challenges. I am confident that, with careful planning, these challenges will be met. <Col N="456"/>Measures to minimise potential risks to efficiency and effectiveness in the period leading up to, during and following the decentralisation to Limerick will be planned and overseen by the departmental decentralisation committee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amnesty International and other human rights organisations have long expressed serious concern about widespread human rights abuses in Mexico, including disappearances, killings, torture by police, arbitrary detentions, death threats and ill-treatment by prison and military authorities.</P>
        <P>While the exact number of victims is not known, Amnesty International estimates 370 women have been murdered in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in the state of Chihuahua over the past 11 years. The Mexican Government has estimated the figure to be 326 while the Mexican National Human Rights Commission's estimate is 263. In addition, there are reports of a large number of disappearances of young women in this region.</P>
        <P>Ciudad Juarez is a city that experiences serious violence and criminality. Its proximity to the border with the United States and the availability of work in its assembly plants attract a highly transient population, complicating the compilation of accurate data. It has become a major centre for drug trafficking and organised crime. Motives have not been established for many of the murders in Ciudad Juarez, although some share common characteristics. The Mexican authorities estimate that approximately one third of the victims were sexually assaulted prior to their deaths, with the remaining having been victims of intrafamilial or other violence.</P>
        <P>Mexican and international NGOs have expressed concern about the necessity to protect the women of Ciudad Juarez and to investigate the murders, stating that the authorities in Chihuahua and at a federal level have failed to recognise the extent of the pattern of violence against women and to implement effective policies for dealing with it. International observers such as representatives of the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have also visited Chihuahua and expressed serious concerns about the investigations to date.</P>
        <P>The question of the respective competencies between the federal and the local level has complicated matters. While steps aimed at improving efficiency had been taken by the local authorities, concerned observers had argued for <Col N="457"/>some time that there was a need for the federal authorities to take a greater direct role in the matter. Federal authorities have become more engaged in the past year, having established grounds for federal intervention on the basis that some of the crimes may be federal offences.</P>
        <P>The Interior Ministry announced a 40 point plan in June 2003 to improve public security, criminal investigations, social advancement and women's rights in Ciudad Juarez. This approach involves various Government agencies. On 11 August 2003 the Government announced the creation of a joint investigating and prosecuting agency made up of the office of the attorney general and the Chihuahua state prosecutor's office.</P>
        <P>The secretary general of Amnesty International, Ms Irene Khan, visited Mexico in August 2003 to present the Amnesty International report on the Ciudad Juarez killings, and she met President Fox. President Fox made a commitment to ensuring that the federal Government played its full role in endeavouring to put a stop to the murders and abductions. On 17 October 2003 he announced the appointment of Ms Guadalupe Morfin Otero as federal commissioner for the cases in Ciudad Juarez. Her role involves co-ordinating the activities of the interagency committee established to facilitate an integrated approach to the full range of the problems which impact negatively on women in the state of Chihuahua. Ms Morfin has a distinguished record as a defender and promoter of human rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland and its EU partners hold regular dialogue with Mexico on matters of mutual interest, including human rights. In November 2003, the question of human rights and the specific situation of violence against women in Ciudad Juarez was raised at a meeting in Brussels of the EU-Mexico joint committee. The Mexican representative acknowledged that the rule of law had malfunctioned over a period of time in that frontier area and outlined the measures being adopted by the Mexican federal and state authorities to strengthen the institutions of law and order with a view to putting an end to what he described as this &ldquo;cancerous phenomenon.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Mexican National Human Rights Commission has welcomed not only the appointment of Ms Morfin as federal commissioner, but also the decision in January 2004 by the federal attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with those Ciudad Juarez killings which have a federal dimension.</P>
        <P>As part of the EU's ongoing human rights dialogue with the Mexican authorities, earlier this month the Irish ambassador in Mexico City arranged for Ms Morfin to meet with EU heads of mission. This dialogue will continue during the remainder of the Irish Presidency and beyond.</P>

My Department will continue to be associated with the process and will closely monitor developments.</P>
        <P>I support the principle of having legally binding international agreements on export controls with as wide a participation as possible. This is particularly important with respect to small arms and light weapons. Ireland is committed to working with others to ensure the illicit trafficking of such weapons is dealt with effectively by the international community.</P>
        <P>A welcome aspect of the draft treaty is it has the objective of setting out states' existing international legal obligations in the area of international transfers of arms. In addition, once ratified, the draft framework treaty would enable the international community to move forward incrementally, by means of subsequent more specific instruments.</P>
        <P>An official of my Department participated in a conference held last November at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine from a legal perspective the text of the draft treaty. The NGOs involved in the promotion of the draft treaty will meet next month in Costa Rica to decide on how this process can be further advanced. The proposed international arms trade treaty is under discussion within the EU. Discussions have taken place at working group level, most recently earlier this month, and will continue during Ireland's Presidency of the EU.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374, 430, 469, 478 and 481 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to VECs to assist towards the child care expenses of participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller centre programmes. The financial provision nationally in 2002 for child care assistance to participants on these programme was &euro;3,019,000. The corresponding provision for 2003 was &euro;2,984,204.</P>
        <P>The estimate by VECs of their needs for child care funding in 2002 exceeded the amount available. Additional funds became available towards the end of 2002, which allowed the Department to allocate supplementary grants in respect of child care assistance. Payout to VECs for 2002 was &euro;4,736,831. In 2003, 27 VECs, including those serving the City of Dublin, County Kerry and County Waterford, requested special assistance by way of additional funding for their child care services. These VECs were asked to indicate their minimal requirements to maintain the service. Following a review of budgetary provision across the range of further education programmes and supports, it was found possible to redesignate certain elements of funding to enable supplementary grants to be allocated for child care. Payout to VECs for 2003 was &euro;4,821,759.00.</P>
        <P>The administration of grants to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller programmes is a matter for individual VECs. A working group comprising representatives of my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association has been established to review the criteria for the allocation of grants for child care for 2004 and into the future with a view to making more efficient use of the funds available in the light of increasing demand. Grants to VECs to assist towards child care expenses of participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller <Col N="461"/>programmes in 2004 will be considered in the light of the provision in the revised Estimates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The group has raised two issues regarding the redress scheme to which a reply has issued. The first of these issues is a request that additional institutions be added to the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. A total of 128 institutions are listed on the Schedule to the Act. Section 4 enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</P>
        <P>The second issue relates to the groups who wish that full information on the operation of the redress board be made available to all former residents. Section 5 (<i>b</i>) of the Act provides that the board shall make all reasonable efforts, through public advertisement, direct correspondence with persons who were residents of an institution, and otherwise, to ensure persons who were residents of an institution are aware of <Col N="464"/>the redress board and its remit. In this regard, the board commenced an advertising campaign in Ireland in December 2002 and the board has indicated that a targeted advertisement campaign in the United Kingdom will commence in early 2004.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government, in devising its policies in the redress area, was conscious that a significant number of former residents of institutions had emigrated to the United Kingdom particularly in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Five outreach officers were appointed to existing Irish centres in the UK to apprise and advise former residents that reside in the UK of developments regarding the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board as well as other relevant matters. The outreach services are funded by my Department and continue to operate and provide appropriate advice. Funding for a post of development worker to co-ordinate and develop the outreach service has also been provided.</P>

        <P>I can confirm that my Department has received applications for special educational needs supports, SEN, from the school, including the applications for the pupils referred to by the Deputy. The school currently has the services of 18 full-time special needs assistants, SNA, one part-time SNA and one job-sharing SNA post.</P>
        <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications <Col N="466"/>were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

        <P>I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001. The report of the working group was recently submitted to me. Issues dealt with in the report include the content and format of the examination modules, the standard of the examinations and the period of provisional recognition granted to applicants within which they are expected to pass the SCG. The report is currently under consideration and decisions in relation to the recommendations contained in it will be taken in due course.</P>
        <P>The review group has drafted an interim syllabus. The redrafted syllabus was circulated to all schools in December 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus.</P>
        <P>The review group has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>
        <P>Courses of study aimed specifically at candidates for the SCG examination are run by a number of education centres throughout the country. The level at which courses are provided is dependent on the demand. Copies of past examination papers, including tapes of the aural examinations, are available on request from primary administration section 1 of my Department in Athlone. In addition, the interim syllabus for the SCG examinations which was circulated to all schools in December, 2002 included a reading list of prose and poetry to be studied for the examinations.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of a full-time and part-time resource teacher together with a shared learning support teacher. My Department has received a further application for special educational resources, SER, from this school. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my <Col N="473"/>Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for SEN within the school.</P>

        <P>The main objective of the commitment to standardise the mid-term breaks and holiday periods at Christmas and Easter as provided by Sustaining Progress is to provide certainty to families on school closure times.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the agreed arrangements for the school year 2003-04 schools were free to decide on holiday periods and mid-term breaks on an individual basis. This led to variation in the closure times of schools, which caused problems to parents with children attending different schools. I am satisfied that the new arrangements provide real benefits to parents.</P>

        <Quest>the reason his Department is now refusing to give the honours allowance to those teachers who have been teaching art for some considerable time and who completed a course in the National College of Art and Design organised by his Department in conjunction with the National University of Ireland and received a diploma in art teaching at honours level; the reason, despite saying in his response dated 29 January 2003, that the matter of the appropriate level of qualification allowance to be paid to teachers who successfully completed this course, was under consideration by his Department and that, when a decision would be <Col N="482"/>reached, his Department would communicate with the teachers concerned and arrangements would be made for the payment to them of the appropriate allowance, this has not happened despite his answer 12 months ago.</Quest>

	<P>My Department has received an application for improved accommodation at Kilconley national school, Ballybunion, County Kerry.</P>
        <P>Progress on this application will depend on the development plan for the north Kerry area resulting from the new model for school planning, which I announced earlier this year. The new school planning model will be piloted in five areas, one of which includes Ballybunion, over the remainder of the school year, with development plans being drawn up for these areas. My main objective is to ensure that all relevant parties have a say and that the process is open and public.</P>
        <P>The Commission on School Accommodation will conduct the public engagement and all submissions made to the commission by interested parties will be published. The commission will then draw up a draft development plan for the area, against which, following acceptance by the Minister, the planning and building unit will assess all applications for capital investment.</P>

	<P>The proposed large-scale building project for Nano Nagle national school is listed in Section 8 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on my Department's website at www.education.ie. This proposed project is at stage 2-3, outline sketch scheme-developed sketch scheme of architectural planning. It has been assigned a &ldquo;band 1&rdquo; rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
        <P>The proposed project will be authorised to progress to advanced architectural planning during 2004. Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</P>

        <P>Special fees for repeat candidates were introduced in 1987 on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect those who have already benefitted from the normal course of post-primary education, and who wish to take an extra year, to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources.</P><Col N="489"/>

        <P>As previously indicated to the Deputy no decisions have been taken on progressing the proposed new second level school for Newport. A final decision on this matter will be taken in the context of a development plan for the Newport and Westport areas resulting from the new model for school planning which I announced earlier this year. The new school planning model will be piloted in five areas, one of which covers the Newport and Westport areas, over the remainder of the school year with development plans being drawn up for these areas. My main objective is to ensure that all relevant parties have a say and that the process is open and public. The Commission on School Accommodation will conduct the public engagement and all submissions made to the commission by interested parties will be published. The commission will then draw up a draft development plan for the area, against which, following acceptance by the Minister, the planning and building unit will assess all applications for capital investment.</P>
        <P>A decision on whether to progress with the school proposed for Newport will be made in the context of the development plan for the Newport and Westport area of County Mayo.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department's higher education grant schemes students who already hold an undergraduate degree are not generally eligible for grant assistance in respect of further study at undergraduate level. There is, however, provision under the terms of the schemes for students who already hold a pass or general degree and are progressing to complete an honours degree in one year. In such cases it must be established that successful completion of <Col N="491"/>the year in question may only result in an honours degree and that there is no possibility of a second award at the same level, that is another pass or general degree.</P>
        <P>My Department understands that the duration of the course, referred to by the Deputy, is 18 months and that successful completion of the course may lead to an award at either honours or pass degree level. As the student in question already holds a general degree and the course does not comply with the provisions of the schemes, she is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of the course. The terms of the schemes are of general application and accordingly it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms in individual cases.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Current Government policy on the provision of services to people with disabilities places emphasis on the importance of mainstreaming. The provision of a third level campus to facilitate people with disabilities would not be consistent with the objective of ensuring services for people with disabilities are provided on an inclusive and integrated basis in line with services to the general public.</P>
        <P>Among the measures my Department is taking to assist students with disabilities to access third level education is the fund for students with disabilities. This fund, which is ESF-aided, was introduced in 1994. It provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, in post-leaving certificate centres.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
        <P>Under the social inclusion measures in the Government's national development plan, there is provision for a third level access fund totalling almost &euro;121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by a number of target groups including students with a disability. The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education, which was established to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation by the target groups, was published in 2001.</P>
        <P>Provision for the fund for students with disabilities has increased from &euro;101,579 in 1994 to a gross level of &euro;5.3 million in the 2003-04 academic year. In addition to the fund, between 1996 and 2003, as part of its targeted initiative funding programme, the Higher Education Authority has allocated more than &euro;7 million towards activities focused on supporting increased access for students with a disability. <Col N="493"/>Among the activities funded have been the employment of specialist staff; the training of academic and non-academic staff; the establishment of units for provision of assistive technology training and support for students and staff; careers support for students with a disability; pre-entry outreach and taster programmes; and post-entry orientation and support.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to supporting initiatives in the area of universal access and funding has been provided in recent years to address physical access problems in existing buildings in the third level sector. Furthermore, all new buildings are required to comply with building regulations governing access. New buildings must incorporate standard design features necessary to facilitate universal access in compliance with part M of the building regulations.</P>

	<P>Arising from the report of a planning group, which was established to consider proposals for the development of a national centre for the visually impaired, my Department engaged a project team to consider an overall development strategy for the implementation of the planning group's report. The report of the project team was presented to my Department towards the end of 2002.</P>
        <P>Having given careful consideration to the matter, I decided in April 2003 that the national centre as proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the schools for the visually impaired and the development costs, estimated to be in excess of &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>St. Joseph's Special School for Visually Impaired, Drumcondra, provides a co-educational service for pupils at primary level and includes some pupils who have transferred from St. Mary's School for the Blind. Parents may also chose to enrol their children in mainstream school settings with the support of the resource teacher, special needs assistant and visiting teacher service. Pobal Scoil Rosmini provides a co-educational service for pupils at second level.</P>
        <P>My Department proposes to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed, in the context of available resources.</P>

	<P>The 2002-03 academic year is the most recent year in respect of which comprehensive statistics are available to my Department. Details of the numbers of students from counties <Col N="495"/>Roscommon and Leitrim attending full-time courses in universities and institutes of technology are outlined in the attached table. The number of students attending PLC courses in those counties is also included; data on the county of origin of these PLC students is not, however, available. The available data in respect of the numbers of students in receipt of grant assistance under all four maintenance grant schemes is also outlined, for the Deputy's information, in the following table.</P>
        <P>My Department funds three student support schemes for students attending third level education: the higher education grants scheme, which generally applies to all university degree courses and is administered by local authorities; third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, which applies to most certificate and diploma courses in institutes of technology and is administered by the vocational education committees and the institutes of technology; and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, which generally applies to add-on courses where students have already pursued certificate or diploma level courses and to certain courses in Northern Ireland and which is administered by the vocational education committees. My Department funds one student support scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses, namely, the maintenance <Col N="496"/>grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses. This scheme is administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
        <P>Under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, the institutes of technology pay the maintenance grants to the students concerned and recoup the moneys directly from my Department. The total number of grant holders in 2002-03 was 13,401. County-specific information is not available at present in respect of the third level maintenance grant scheme for trainees.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses, grant applicants are assessed by the VEC in whose administrative area they reside. However, eligible students are subsequently paid their grants by the VEC in whose administrative area the PLC centre they are attending is situated. Accordingly, separate figures are available to my Department in respect of: the numbers of students attending PLC centres in counties Roscommon and Leitrim and the numbers of students from each county approved for grant assistance by their respective VECs under the PLC scheme. The Deputy should note that the higher number of students in receipt of assistance is accounted for by the attendance of students from Roscommon at centres outside of their county of origin.</P><Col N="495"/>

	<P>For the purposes of the post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two of more centres. The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult local educational interests, where any such adjustments are being contemplated.</P>

	<P>I moved an amendment to the definition of disability in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 on Committee Stage on 5 January. At that time, I stated why I felt that the definition now in the Bill is the most practical. I also said that, in light of our discussions on Committee Stage, I would reconsider the definition of disability to see if it could be improved upon. However, I am of the view that to accept the Deputy's suggestion would be to extend the definition of disability unduly and I believe that would be counter-productive.</P>
        <P>The provision of education services for the majority of children in our primary and post-primary schools is governed by the Education Act 1998. This Bill is intended to benefit those who most need assistance in accessing education services and I have no wish to dilute the attention due to them by attempting to cater to needs beyond those caused by a disability. It is essential that the conditions which attract the benefits of the Bill are enduring so as to ensure that vital resources are used for those who really need them. The remainder of the definition in the Bill as it stands provides a sensible base from which to determine who has a disability for the purposes of the Bill and more importantly who will benefit from the very focused and specialised educational provision which will be made as a result of it.</P>

	<P>As a rule primary school transport <Col N="500"/>routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
        <P>The student in question resides 0.5 miles from the route of service. As this is well within range of the existing service, it would not be open to my Department to extend the service as requested. There is provision for parents to pay for extensions of bus services where feasible, having regard to time schedules and avoidance of major disruption to other pupils using the service. Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised my Department that an extension of the bus service could be implemented under this provision in this case. If the family is interested in meeting the cost of extending the service, it should contact school transport section of my Department in Tullamore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage is one of a number of access measures recommended in the 2001 report of the action group on access to third level education. The fund provides assistance to partnership <Col N="502"/>companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management &mdash; ADM Limited under the aegis of which the partnerships operate, administers the fund on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>An allocation of &euro;1.27 million per year was recommended for the millennium partnership fund for the duration of the national development programme to 2006. The recommendation was implemented when the fund was introduced with effect from the 2001-02 academic year. However, for the 2002-03 academic year, I significantly increased the allocation to &euro;2 million. A provision of &euro;2 million was also made in respect of the millennium partnership fund for 2003.</P>
        <P>Northside Partnership received funding to the amount of &euro;120,000 in the 2002-03 academic period from ADM under the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage, 2002-03. Previously the partnership had been in receipt of direct funding from my Department. I understand that in order to facilitate ten new applicant groups to the 2003-04 fund, ADM decided to make reductions in the budgets of partnerships and community groups across the board.</P>
        <P>In the current academic year, 2003-04, Northside Partnership has a budget of &euro;114,475, which includes a carryover from the previous round of the fund. Apart from the Cork Consortium; covering both Cork city and county, which received &euro;145,000 for the current academic year, Northside Partnership received the highest allocation of funding under the fund, significantly more than other Dublin based partnerships. This was also the situation in 2002-03. There are currently 59 groups implementing the millennium partnership fund at a local level <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> 35 groups which were involved in managing the fund since its inception in 2001.</P>
        <P>Two other key recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education were the introduction of special rates of maintenance or top-up grants and the establishment of a national office of equity of access to higher education. Following a review of the special rates of maintenance grant in 2002, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000. This target was exceeded with approximately 8,000 students receiving the top-up grant in 2002-03.</P>
        <P>In addition, last May I announced a package of measures costing &euro;42 million in a full year to address the problem of disadvantage in third level education. The main provisions are: an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant, to give a maximum grant of &euro;2,885, this compares with &euro;2,510 in 2002-03; significant increases in the reckonable income limits for purposes of the ordinary and special rates of grant; the introduction of a revised income limit scheme, to include the following threshold levels, namely. a new part maintenance, 75% and full fees, an <Col N="503"/>upgrading of the full fees only income limit to become a part maintenance, 25%, and full fees entitlement; the top income limit has been increased from &euro;36,897 to &euro;40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge; and the higher, non-adjacent rate of the special rate of maintenance grant has been increased to &euro;4,495 an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance and the adjacent rate has been increased to &euro;1,800. These increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of &euro;1,610 and &euro;645, respectively.</P>
        <P>Following my approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority, a number of senior staff have been recruited and the office is now operational. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I have made it clear that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. My objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.</P>
        <P>My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003-05, NAPSincl, and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. In addition to the ordinary maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, my Department has responsibility for promoting access and participation opportunities for students in higher education and on PLC courses. Under the social inclusion measures in the national development plan, there was provision for a third level access fund totalling &euro;121 million, during the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by three target groups: <Col N="504"/>students from disadvantaged backgrounds; mature students; and students with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education, published in 2001, set out a blueprint for the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access. The third level access fund comprises the following funds/measures: special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students; the ESF-aided student assistance fund; the ESF-aided fund for students with disabilities; and the ESF-aided millennium partnership fund for disadvantage</P>
        <P>Since 1997 spending on third level access measures funded directly by the Department of Education and Science has increased from &euro;500,000 to &euro;26 million in 2003. By any standards, this represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources. The provision for 2003 is &euro;27 million. This brings the total allocation on these access measures, including the 2004 provision, since the commencement of the national development plan in 2000, to &euro;96.7 million.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last May I announced a new package of measures costing &euro;42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grants for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. I believe that this substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority has for a number of years provided dedicated funding to the universities and other HEA designated institutions to support new developments in areas of strategic importance in higher education. One particular priority area is that of broadening access to the universities and HEA institutions for students from traditionally under-represented groups. These include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and travellers. In 2002, the HEA provided over &euro;6 million to support institutions in initiatives aimed at providing for such broadened access. For 2003, this provision increased to &euro;7.4 million. In addition, in the technological sector, there is provision, from within the charge for student services, registration and examinations, for access funding amounting to approximately &euro;500,000.</P>

        <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the level of importance and priority given by all Departments and in particular the Department of Education and Science to projects identified locally in Athy, County Kildare, under the RAPID programme; and the steps he intends to take to ensure that the RAPID programme is taken seriously.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1690/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The RAPID programme is designed to harness the opportunities and resources of the national development plan, NDP, through the frontloading and prioritisation of investment to the 45 most deprived communities in the country <Col N="506"/>&mdash; 25 urban areas and 20 provincial towns. This does not involve additional funding to that being provided under the NDP. The area implementation team in Athy has submitted five proposals under the RAPID programme. The current position on each proposal is outlined as follows.</P>
        <P>Construction of new community college in Athy, Ke-Athy-001. The proposed large-scale building project for Athy community college is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme, which is now published on my Department's website at www.education.ie. The new school project is at an early stage of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
        <P>Home-school liaison for Scoil Mhichil Naofa primary school &mdash; St. Patrick's CBS, Ke-Athy-002. The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no plans at present to expand this scheme but in the event of any future expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme, I assure the Deputy that the needs of Scoil Mhichil Naofa and St. Patrick's CBS will be fully considered.</P>
        <P>Early start programme for Scoil Mhichil Naofa primary school, Ke-Athy-003. This proposal relates to the early start pre-school pilot project. The early start project, which was launched in 1994, is currently in place in 40 selected schools in disadvantaged areas. It is aimed at children, aged between three and four years who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential. It provides young children with an educational programme that will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years</P>
        <P>The question of developing and funding particular pre-school initiatives or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by the centre for early childhood development and education. This centre was established in 2001 to co-ordinate developments in the early education sector on behalf of my Department on foot of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn. The centre will also develop targeted interventions on a pilot basis for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities, building on the experience of existing programmes. This RAPID proposal has been sent to the centre for their consideration in this context.</P>
        <P>Expand Kildare youth service activity for Athy youth, Ke-Athy-012. The Athy youth project received an allocation of &euro;70,174 in 2003 under the special projects for youth scheme. The level of support for the Athy youth project in 2004 will <Col N="507"/>be considered in the context of available resources.</P>
        <P>Application for the inclusion of Athy in the school completion programme, Ke-Athy-017. The school completion programme, SCP, which was launched in 2002, incorporates the learning experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the existing eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. Athy community college, which is one of the schools in Athy seeking admission to SCP, is already in the SSRI. The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their retention rates from the Department's post-primary pupil database. The inclusion of further schools in the project strand of the school completion programme is under consideration at present.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the aims of the RAPID programme, my Department has endeavoured, where possible, to frontload resources to support proposals submitted from RAPID areas, including those from Athy. My Department is currently in the process of establishing ten regional offices throughout the country. These offices, including an office in Naas which will serve counties Kildare and Wicklow, will further strengthen my Department's commitment and contribution to local and regional developments such as the RAPID initiative.</P>

        <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service, NEPS. These applications <Col N="508"/>are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so.

        <P>The post-leaving certificate review was commissioned by my Department to examine the sector and make recommendations as necessary regarding the organisational, support, development, technical and administrative structures and resources required in schools with large-scale post-leaving certificate, PLC, <Col N="510"/>provision. The final report was completed in April 2003.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision, including issues which impact on the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future, and on other sectors of the education system. Exploratory meetings have taken place between officials in my Department and the management and staff representative interests in the sector to examine their respective priorities and to consider issues surrounding a number of the recommendations in the report. Further exploratory meetings with relevant stakeholders in the sector will be necessary in the period ahead in connection with this report.</P>
        <P>Maintenance grants were introduced for students registered on post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs, in September 1998 following a commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. Such courses play a key role in preparing people for employment and further education-training. However, PLC courses are offered over one or two years in VEC and other post-primary schools and lead to national awards at FETAC levels 1 and 2. PLC courses may lead, on progression, to specified higher education courses in the institutes of technology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The purchase of new school sites is underpinned by a thorough assessment of the need for new educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area. The process takes account of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the type and extent of existing school provision serving the area.</P>
        <P>As part of the process, my Department monitors county development plans and area action plans and meets local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments. An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments in respect of the capacity of any existing schools and, where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. Such reservations may ultimately result in the acquisition of the site and the development of a school or schools.</P>
        <P>Ultimate acquisition of sites is dependent on the availability of funding and the priority to be accorded to each individual project. The same criteria used to prioritise large-scale capital projects are also used to prioritise site acquisitions. These criteria were first published in the 2003 school building programme and are again set out in the 2004 programme which I published in December 2003.</P>
        <P>With funding of &euro;32 million available in 2004 for site acquisitions, my Department intends to purchase a significant number of sites during 2004. However, due to commercial sensitivities of site acquisition, it is not proposed at this stage to identify the specific sites to be acquired. However, this information will be placed on my Department's website when the relevant acquisitions have been completed.</P>

	<P>With regard to the roof damage, one of my Department's technical staff visited the school and reported that the damaged part of the roof has now been repaired. I understand that the cost of these repairs was dealt with by the school through their insurance. The school has also been advised to complete an application under the summer works scheme for roof replacement. This new scheme caters for works that can be planned and delivered during the summer holidays. The 2004 programme will be updated in early spring to provide details of approved projects under the scheme.</P>
        <P>A consultant working for the health and safety unit of the Office of Public Works has also visited the school to prepare a report on the asbestos.

        <P>The large-scale project, which will involve works in both the junior and senior schools is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. It is listed in section eight of the school building programme. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</P>

	<P>Teachers in national schools are generalists rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
        <P>Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification. To become fully recognised, they must pass the written, aural and oral parts of an examination in the Irish language an scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG. These teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during the period of provisional recognition. The SCG examination is held twice each year in four centres, Athlone, Dublin, Cork and Sligo. Applications for the examination are processed by primary administration section 1 of my Department in Athlone. Applicants must be holders of provisional recognition.</P>
        <P>The report of the working group, that was established in 2001 to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the SCG, was recently submitted to me. Issues dealt with in the report include the content and format of the examination modules, the standard of the examinations and the period of provisional recognition granted to applicants within which they are expected to pass the SCG. The report is currently under consideration and decisions in respect of the recommendations contained in it will be taken in due course.</P>
        <P>The review group has drafted an interim syllabus. The redrafted syllabus was circulated to all schools in December 2002 and the SCG examinations held on 29, 30 and 31 October, 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus. The groups has also drafted a handbook for the examination. The handbook will contain detailed information on the SCG and will provide answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. It is also planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>
        <P>My Department grants restricted recognition to certain categories of teachers, who are not fully qualified to teach mainstream classes in national schools, to render them eligible to teach in certain special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. These teachers are <Col N="515"/>entitled to be placed on the trained teacher's common basic scale. Such teachers are also eligible for posts as resource teachers for children with special needs in mainstream schools, but are not eligible for learning support posts in mainstream schools. Teachers who hold restricted recognition are not required to take the SCG unless they wish to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>

	<P>The graduate diploma course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers. The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year in four of the colleges of education and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then.</P>
        <P>There are currently 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Based on the significant increase in the output of qualified teachers coming from the colleges of education and having considered the range of additional measures in place to address the supply of qualified teachers, my Department has requested the colleges of education to provide another postgraduate course to commence early in 2004 and to revert to 280 places as had previously been the case. The position with regard to future years will be considered in the context of teacher supply and available resources.</P>

	<P>The primary school curriculum 1971 did not recommend a particular time allocation for the teaching of Irish. However, an allocation suggested at some inservice courses, which <Col N="516"/>recommended five hours weekly for Irish in first to sixth classes, was widely accepted. No distinction was made between the pupil's first and second languages in this recommendation.</P>
        <P>The introduction to the primary school curriculum, 1999, provides a suggested minimum weekly time framework. For the first time, a period of discretionary curriculum time, two hours per week for pupils in first to sixth classes, was included. This time can be allocated at the discretion of the teacher and the school to any of the subjects on the curriculum, including Irish, in response to children's needs in particular areas of learning. The inclusion of discretionary curriculum time meant that the recommended times for most of the other subjects was reduced.</P>
        <P>In addition, the primary school curriculum distinguishes between the first language and the second language of teaching and learning. It suggests four hours for the formal teaching of Irish in the case of Gaeltacht and Irish-medium schools in first to sixth classes and three hours and thirty minutes for the formal teaching of the subject where Irish is taught as a second language. The curriculum also strongly recommends that Irish be used frequently in classroom interactions and communication and as a medium for teaching some aspects of the curriculum other than Irish in English-medium schools to reinforce the knowledge gained in formal Irish lessons and to provide opportunities to use the language in real situations.</P>
        <P>No major scientific study of the standards of pupil achievement in Irish has been published since Dr. John Harris's work, &ldquo;Spoken Irish in Primary Schools&rdquo;, appeared in 1984. However, a significant study of pupil achievement in Irish in sixth class, commissioned by my Department, was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2002 and its results are awaited. The number and percentage of candidates taking the higher or honours paper in the established leaving certificate for the past three years were as follows: 2001, 15,719 or 30.93%; 2002, 14,901 or 30.36%; and 2003,15,102 or 30.31%. The percentages of candidates receiving grade C or better were as follows: 2001, 79.20%; 2002, 83.80%; and 2003, 80.30%.</P>
        <P>Entry requirements for admission to third level courses are generally set down by the relevant higher education institutions. However, my Department specifies the entry requirements for entry to colleges of education. The entry requirements specify that all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. The relevant courses are the Bachelor of Education degree course and the Graduate Diploma in Education, Primary Teaching.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear at every opportunity that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels.</P>
        <P>My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's national action plan against poverty and social exclusion 2003-05 and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on tackling educational disadvantage: literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.</P>
        <P>I provided &euro;460 million in 2003 for measures designed to counter educational disadvantage by targeting resources at pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. This included provision for the following initiatives: pre-school programmes such as the early start pilot project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage; disadvantaged programmes at primary level such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home-school liaison scheme and the giving children an even break programme; post-primary level disadvantaged schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme and the home school community liaison scheme; the school completion programme which operates at primary and post-primary level and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving; disadvantaged youth schemes; further education measures such as the back to education initiative, the youthreach programme and the adult literacy programme; measures specifically designed to broaden access to third level education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
        <P>In addition, in May 2003 I announced a new package of measures costing &euro;42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grants for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>In all this work I am advised by the statutory Educational Disadvantage Committee set up under the Education Act 1998, to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee, chaired by Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland, brings together experts from across the <Col N="518"/>community of education interests and is an important resource for me in ensuring that real progress is made in this area. One of my key concerns is to improve the level of integration between the various educational disadvantage programmes operated by my Department. In this regard, I have requested the committee to undertake a &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; review of all of the programmes to ensure optimum synergy and integration between them. The committee is currently engaged in this review.</P>

SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received.

	<P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
        <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate or PLC courses.</P>
        <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly <Col N="523"/>refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. No appeal has been received in the student support unit of my Department from the student referred to by the Deputy. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
        <P>It is not open to me or to my Department to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.</P>

	<P>My Department grants restricted recognition to certain categories of teachers, who are not fully qualified to teach in mainstream national schools, to render them eligible to teach in certain special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish <Col N="524"/>is not a curricular requirement. Such teachers are also eligible for posts as resource teachers for children with special needs in mainstream schools but are not eligible for learning support posts in mainstream schools.</P>
        <P>Teachers with restricted recognition, working in a post their recognition entitles them to hold, are entitled to be placed on the same salary scale and enjoy the same sick leave and pension entitlements as fully recognised teachers. They are not, however, recognised as qualified to teach in mainstream classes in national schools and would therefore be regarded as untrained in respect of any service in a temporary post in a mainstream class.</P>
        <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &mdash; AMI &mdash; College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Montessori school, who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration accredited by the National Council for Educational Awards may be granted restricted recognition. These conditions are set out in circular 25/00, recognition of teacher qualifications for the purpose of teaching in national schools. It is open to any other Montessori course provider to submit a course to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council or HETAC for accreditation. Without such accreditation, my Department will not approve the course for the purposes of employment as a primary teacher.</P>

        <P>Staff in schools catering for pupils with special educational needs will continue to be supported by my Department through the provision of appropriate inservice training.

        <P>In announcing the Government's decision on pension age, and also on the intended abolition of compulsory retirement age for most new entrant public servants from 1 April 2004, the Minister for Finance stated that the public service unions would be fully informed about the implementation of the reforms in advance of their introduction with effect from 1 April 2004.

	<P>In 2003 I received requests from a number of governing bodies of institutes of technology for approval to apply the student <Col N="527"/>service charge to defray the costs of registration, examinations and student services, to students enrolled on F&Aacute;S apprenticeship courses. The institutes argued that a <i>pro rata</i> charge should be levied on apprentices on the basis that they avail of the full range of services provided to students. The institutes considered that it was inequitable to levy the charge on full-time students only and that the full-time students were effectively subsidising apprentices through their contributions toward the cost of providing student services.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the case made by the institutes of technology, I decided to approve the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> student services charge for F&Aacute;S apprentices to commence in January 2004.</P>

	<P>The small and rural primary schools initiative operates on a devolved basis. It allows boards of management to address the accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives the boards control over the pace at which building works proceed. The amount of the grant ranges between &euro;100,000 and &euro;350,000, depending on the pupil enrolment and the size of the school. This initiative is aimed at schools with a maximum of four classrooms. Closing date for accepting invitations into the pilot initiative is Friday, 30 January 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to schools under this initiative.

        <P>Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid. My Department understands that, in the case cited by the Deputy, progression at postgraduate level is not involved and, accordingly, the student in question is not eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the functions of school principals provided for in this legislation simply reflect the current work of principals. However, I am conscious that the Bill will effect a significant change in the management of special educational needs.</P>
        <P>For this reason, I have included an amendment on Committee Stage which restates the principal's right to delegate any of his or her functions to members of the teaching staff or other employees of the school as he or she sees fit. The amendment also requires the special educational needs organiser to assist principals and teachers in carrying out their functions under the Bill. In addition, I have been careful to provide for an implementation period of up to five years for all provisions of the Bill. This will ensure that the national council for special education will have adequate time to consider the implications of the Bill on all the stakeholders, including boards of management, teachers and principals. The council also has power to make <Col N="532"/>recommendations to me, including recommendations on the resources that will have to be made available so that duties under the Bill can be fulfilled.</P>
        <P>Finally, section 12 of the Bill, for the first time, places a statutory duty on the Ministers for Education and Science, Health and Children and Finance to make resources available to schools for the provision of adequate and appropriate education to children with special educational needs. In making policy determinations regarding the resources to be made available to implement education plans, the Ministers must have regard to key principles, including the need for equitable treatment of all children, and that it is the objective of the Bill that it will lead to the creation of an education system which gives to children with disabilities the same opportunity for development through education as is given to children who do not have disabilities.</P>

        <P>As stated in the budget announcement, Ministers with headquarters outside Dublin will be provided with a centralised suite of offices for a small secretariat to enable them to conduct business while in Dublin and when the D&aacute;il is in session.

	<P>My Department received an application from the school concerned for resource teaching support during the period 15 February 2003 to 31 August 2003. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nation-wide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

        <P>As outlined in the appendices to the school building programme, the initial assignment of a project to a particular band does not preclude its subsequent re-assignment to a different band as circumstances change and this was the case in a number of projects, which were included in this year's school building programme. As the Deputy will be aware, band 1 status is accorded to projects which provide new schools to cater for substantial increase in enrolments in rapidly developing areas.</P>

	<P>At present 128 institutions are listed on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are eligible for inclusion. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.</P>

	<P>My Department does not operate a specific national scheme for the provision of homework clubs. However, a range of schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, under which resources are allocated for the provision of a range of holistic supports, enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school.</P>
        <P>Some 82 projects, 109 post-primary schools and 296 primary schools, participate in the school completion programme, which aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Each project site must devise a collaborative programme of in-school and out-of-school actions, which provide after-school, holiday time, home, family and community supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education.</P>
        <P>A total of 2,344 primary schools are participating in Giving Children an Even Break and are in receipt of additional supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. After-school support services, which include literacy and numeracy, personal development, leisure and sporting activities are among the supports provided under this initiative.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided funding for homework clubs in disadvantaged areas under the fund for the development of targeted responses to certain children at risk. This fund is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Its purpose is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. In addition, many of the area partnership companies have provided homework support under their education measures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In the organisation of the school transport system, buses are normally required to operate a number of runs. This is to provide a basic level of service, while achieving optimum value from resources available. In order to facilitate the effective operation of these services, children may be required to be dropped off prior to school opening hours or picked up some time later than the end of the school day. This is a feature of the school transport scheme as operated throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Essentially, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary schools to arrange adequate supervision and insurance cover for children while they are on the school premises. Subject to the authority of the board of management, it is the responsibility of the principal teacher to organise and participate in the effective supervision of pupils during breaks, lunch periods, assembly and dismissal.</P>

	<P>There are 126 psychologists employed <Col N="540"/>in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, at present, in addition to psychologists employed elsewhere in the educational system. My Department has made offers of employment in NEPS to a further five psychologists, who are expected to take up their duties during 2004.</P>
        <P>Due to the current general staffing constraints in the public service, it is unlikely that full roll-out of the psychological service to all schools will have been achieved by the target date of 1 September 2004. This means that there cannot be any major changes in the level of service in County Kildare during the current school year. However, I remain committed to the expansion, as resources permit, of NEPS until all schools in the country have access to an educational psychological service. Meanwhile, schools without access to the NEPS service may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, details of which may be found on my Department's website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>At primary level, history is a subject within social, environmental and scientific education, one of seven curriculum areas. The curriculum provides a wide range of specific units that allow teachers flexibility to ensure that pupils have an understanding of the broad sweep of history. For fifth and sixth class, these units include &ldquo;Changing roles of women in the 19th and 20th centuries&rdquo; and &ldquo;1916 and the foundation of the State&rdquo;. At post-primary level, junior cycle students focus on &ldquo;the role of women&rdquo; as a named element of their study of social change in 20th century Ireland. In addition, they are urged to study the events and movements of the period 1912-22, which should include key female participants. Junior certificate examination papers lend support to the position of women in Irish history through regular questions on, for example, the changing role of women and recently, questions on an account by Kathleen Clarke.</P>
        <P>Within transition year there is substantial provision for the study of women's history. The transition year support service website contains modules on a number of early modern women's history topics. The gender equality unit of the Department of Education and Science has produced a superb resource for schools entitled &ldquo;Discovering Women in Irish History&rdquo;. Apart from containing biographical material on modern Irish women such as Ann Devlin, Kate O'Callaghan and Jenny Wyse Power, this resource deals with women's movements such as the Ladies' Land League, Inghinidhe na hEireann, Unionist women and Cumann na mBan. The roles of women in the rise of Sinn F&eacute;in, the 1918 general election, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Civil War and Northern Ireland are all charted. In addition, significant attention is given to women such as Hannah Sheehy Skeffington, Countess Markievicz, Maud Gonne and Lady <Col N="547"/>Gregory. It is anticipated that this resource, on CD-ROM and in book form, will be in all second level schools before the start of the next academic year and will give renewed impetus to the study of Irish women's history in transition year and beyond.</P>
        <P>At senior cycle, a revised leaving certificate syllabus for history will be implemented in schools in September 2004. The revised syllabus stipulates that, &ldquo;attention should be given to the experiences of women.&rdquo; Each topic provides for the study of a number of key female personalities ranging from Grace O'Malley up to and including Mother Mary Aikenhead, Evie Hone, Bernadette Devlin and Mary Robinson. The prescribed roles of Hannah Sheehy Skeffington and Countess Markievicz are particularly relevant to the campaigns for social justice, gender equality and independence in the early 20th century context. A research topic is open to all students and this allows wide scope to those who wish to undertake research work on individual women, women's movements and related topics. In the light of this provision at primary and post-primary level, I am confident that the role of women in Irish history and in the Irish independence movement is well catered for in our schools.</P>

Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and the nature and level of support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
        <P>For this school year my Department has allocated 2.08 whole-time equivalent teacher posts and three whole-time special needs assistant posts to the school in question to cater for students with special educational needs. This allocation was based on the assessed needs of students attending the school for whom support was sought. It also had regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school to address such needs. In the 2002-03 school year my Department allocated 1.62 whole-time equivalent teacher posts and three whole-time special needs assistant posts to the school to cater for students with special needs.</P>

        <P>Institi&uacute;id Teangeola&iacute;ochta &Eacute;ireann is a company limited by guarantee. In recent years a value for money study and an independent consultancy study have made recommendations for the reorganisation of the institute's activities. My Department had discussions with representatives of the executive committee of the company about its future intentions, having regard to several operational issues. The operation of the company is a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association.</P>
        <P>At an extraordinary general meeting of ITE, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. A meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. The period of notice of redundancy for the staff has been extended by four weeks from 9 January 2004 to 6 February 2004. Officials from my <Col N="549"/>Department met with all members of staff of ITE in December 2003.</P>
        <P>My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its future intentions, in partnership with the staff of the institute. This will include arrangements for ensuring the continuation of the research functions previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for permanent staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance. My Department is exploring options that may be available in this context. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate redeployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts. I have asked to be kept informed of progress in these matters. The funding provided to the company since 2000 is as follows: 2000, &euro;1.638 million; 2001, &euro;1.657 million; 2002, &euro;1.764 million; 2003, &euro;1.985 million. The funding proposed for 2004 is likely to be of the order of &euro;2.5 million in the context of the liquidation and this will be reflected in the revised estimates.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. I understand that insurance costs take into account the value of the school premises, the number of staff and the number of pupils. Different ratings apply and have done so for many years in the Dublin area, other major cities and rural areas. Other factors taken into account when seeking insurance cover includes risk assessment advice and prompt settlement of claims. I also understand that insurance cover is <Col N="551"/>obtained, on a block basis, by most voluntary secondary schools, operated by religious authorities. The benefit of a survey of school insurance costs, as suggested by the Deputy, is not clear. My Department, however, is prepared to consider applications for grant-aid towards the cost of any necessary improvements in risk avoidance measures required by schools such as boundary fencing, etc.</P>
        <P>Funding is provided to secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. Moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of voluntary secondary schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would meet the cost and reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks. It would also reduce the incentive for school managements to actively review and tender for insurance cover on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I am committed to improving the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritising available resources to address the needs of schools. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to &euro;108,000.</P>

	<P>My Department issued &euro;1,890,299.48 to County Wexford schools during 2003 in respect of building projects at primary level. I was in a position to have payments under the grant scheme for minor works issued during 2003 in respect of both the academic year 2002-03 and the academic year 2003-04. Under that scheme, payments issued to all primary schools in County Wexford during 2003 at a rate of &euro;3,809.21 per school 
and &euro;12.70 per pupil enrolled in respect of each of the two academic years. The total capital allocation for the primary school buildings programme for 2004 is &euro;200 million, covering projects in all counties. Only projects at construction stage have exact costings. It is inappropriate therefore to attempt to indicate the level of expenditure on a county basis as this <Col N="552"/>could compromise the value for money benefit that my Department strives to achieve under the tender process for projects still in architectural planning. Furthermore, the deadline for applications from schools for inclusion under the recently introduced summer works scheme is not yet closed and it is not possible to estimate how many schools will be successful under this scheme on a national or county basis.</P>

	<P>Brownsgrove national school is a two-classroom school that has been invited to participate in a devolved initiative to enable it provide additional permanent ancillary accommodation at the school within a maximum grant level of &euro;100,000. This initiative devolves control to school authorities over the planning and construction phases of small-scale additional permanent accommodation works. The closing date for accepting invitations into this scheme is Friday, 30 January 2004. If there is a shortfall in funding, the options open to the board of management are to: reduce the scale of the works to stay within the limit of the grant; use funds allocated by the Department under the terms of the grant scheme for minor works to supplement the grant provided such funds are not required for more urgent and immediate works; fund the balance of the works from their own resources and decline the invitation to participate in the scheme. My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to the school. This provision is necessary because a central tenet of the devolved scheme is that a school authority, granted discretion and guaranteed funding to enable immediate progress on its accommodation needs, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, control of costs and ensuring value for money.</P>

	<P>The pilot small schools initiative was expanded as part of the 2004 school building programme and more than 50 additional schools were invited to participate in the initiative. Many other schools would like to be given the opportunity to participate but it is necessary to evaluate the initiative fully before broadening the scheme's scope to cover all schools. The band rating assigned by my Department to individual projects in architectural planning was used to determine which of these projects would be considered for inclusion in the 2004 school building programme as part of the small schools initiative. A large-scale building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on my Department's website at<i> www.education.ie</i>. This proposed project is at the early stages of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Band 3 projects were not considered at this time for inclusion in the small schools initiative.</P>
        <P>The budget announcement regarding multiannual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multiannual framework for the school building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects not progressing in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement on this during the year. I have put in place a new devolved summer works scheme. This caters for necessary works that can be planned and delivered during the summer holidays. The 2004 programme will be updated in early spring to provide details of projects approved under the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to <Col N="556"/>answer Questions Nos. 588, 590, 604 and 613 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation. The Government recognises the importance of a balanced regional roll-out of broadband, and is taking a series of initiatives to support and complement investment by the private companies operating in the market.</P>
        <P>An indicative &euro;200 million has been set aside for the current programme of broadband infrastructure developments under the NDP 2000-2006. This includes funding for 19 metropolitan area networks in towns and cities across the country, the extension of digital subscriber lines by Eircom and Esat BT, the construction of a third national fibre trunk network by the ESB, and other regional broadband investment initiatives. In my recent announcement of the broadband action plan I outlined the proposals to stimulate broadband-capable infrastructural investment throughout Ireland. The key elements of the plan include the provision of broadband infrastructure in over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 people using community broadband exchanges and strategic fibre. A new group broadband scheme &mdash; similar to the group water schemes &mdash; is proposed for smaller communities to pool their demand and secure high speed connectivity from a range of service providers, with grant assistance from the Government under this scheme. A multiannual budget of &euro;140 million has been committed to the broadband action plan in partnership with the local authorities and in co-operation with the telecoms industry here. Operational details for the broadband action plan are being finalised, and I expect to be able to make a full announcement shortly.</P>
        <P>It is of course possible to obtain broadband services in most places in Ireland at the moment, using one of the satellite and wireless service providers such as Amocom Satellite, Digiweb, Media Sat, South West Regional Authority or appliedDot Solutions Ltd. A full list of approved providers can be obtained from <i>www.comreg.ie </i>or by telephoning 01-804 6900.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 592 together.</P>
        <P>The national survey of public exposure to radio frequency emissions from mobile telephone masts began last year and will be completed during 2004. This survey which encompasses 400 masts and represents 10% of all telephone masts in the country is one of the most comprehensive surveys of public exposure to telephone masts so far undertaken in Europe. It is being carried out by the consultants Manor Communications, on behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation. The survey involves the measurement of non-ionising radiation levels in the vicinity of phone masts in every county and major town in Ireland. Where the site in question is used solely for mobile telephony, measurements are made over the 300MHz to 2GHz range. However, where the site is shared with others such as the emergency services, local radio and paging, exposures are measured across the wider frequency range of 30MHz to 40GHz.</P>
        <P>COMREG published the first interim report of the national survey on 20 November 2003. It summarises the results of the first 100 base stations surveyed. These were located mainly in the south and west of the country. The results show that the highest public exposures measured at these sites are all well below the maximum public exposure levels set out by the EU Council of Health Ministers in their recommendation of 12 July 1999. In most cases the level of public exposure is less than one ten-thousandth of the recommended maximum permissible amount.</P>
        <P>COMREG will issue further reports as the national survey progresses. The results of the first interim report are available on <i>www.comreg.ie</i> and on <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie.</i></P>

	<P>The fishing vessel the Atlantic Dawn and its fishing activities are subject to fisheries control in line with all other Irish and non-Irish fishing vessels. As this fishing vessel conducts its landings in ports outside Ireland it has not been subject to inspection by Irish fishery officers. However, the fishing vessels' activities are subject to continuous monitoring via satellite monitoring systems, VMS, at the fisheries monitoring centre at Haulbowline. This VMS data is verified to ensure the fishing vessel's compliance with both national and European fishing regulations. In addition, the Irish authorities are kept informed of the outcome of controls carried out in other member states by the control authorities in those member states.</P>

	<P>As part of the overall agreement which facilitated the introduction of the <i>Atlantic Dawn, </i>the Atlantic Dawn company permanently withdrew MFV <i>Veronica </i>from the Irish-EU fishing fleet and retained the annual quota and fishing effort entitlements in EU waters associated with the <i>Veronica. </i>The company is utilising the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to take up these entitlements. These entitlements represent the annually determined allocation of mackerel and herring, access to horse mackerel and blue whiting, and the annual fishing effort &mdash; days at sea &mdash; allocation &mdash; the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was last year permitted to fish for <Col N="561"/>only 92 days in EU waters. In 2003, the<i> Atlantic Dawn</i> was allocated under a national quota management system 4.98 % of the Irish mackerel quota and 5.59 % of the north-west herring quotas. Individual catch limits were not applied to the horse mackerel or blue whiting quotas. These entitlements all relate to EU and contiguous waters rather than Irish waters and under the terms of its sea-fishing boat licence, the <i>Atlantic Dawn </i>is precluded from fishing within 12 miles of the Irish coast and from fishing in the Irish Sea.</P>

	<P>By way of background, the European Commission's agreement to facilitate the introduction of the MFV <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> into the fleet was subject to resolution of an outstanding over-capacity engine power situation in the Irish pelagic fleet segment. To address this long-standing problem, which was not caused by the Atlantic Dawn company, the company removed the MFV <i>Veronica </i>from the Irish and EU registers and its engine power capacity was permanently deleted. The tonnage capacity of the pelagic segment was already within the EU capacity limit and, in the circumstances, the<i> Atlantic Dawn </i>company was allowed to retain the tonnage capacity of the <i>Veronica. </i>The use of this capacity is, however, subject to advance approval and must not conflict with legal or fleet policy obligations. Sea-fishing boat licensing policy permits the use of a maximum of 4,474 gross tonnes of the capacity formerly associated with the<i> Veronica, </i>subject to approval. I understand that the independent licensing authority has to date approved the assignment of a total of 2,703 gross tonnes from the Atlantic Dawn company to pelagic vessel owners, for use as additional replacement capacity required in the proposed licensing of larger replacement vessels.</P>

	<P>My Department closely monitors all developments in the area of wireless telephony and non-ionising radiation, including their possible health effects. The report by the independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation published earlier this month in the UK appraised all technical, scientific and medical literature dealing with mobile telephony and health that had been published since the earlier report of the independent expert group on mobile phones &mdash; the Stewart report &mdash; in 2000. This latest advisory group report concluded:</P>
        <P LI="1">In aggregate the research published since the Stewart report does not give cause for concern. The weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are adverse health effects from exposures to RF fields below guideline levels, but the published research on RF exposures and health has limitations, and mobile phones have only been in widespread use for a relatively short time. The possibility therefore remains open that there could be health effects from exposure to RF fields below guideline levels; hence continued research is needed.</P><Col N="563"/>
        <P FLI="0">The earlier Stewart report also found no evidence of harm to human health from mobile phones. It recommended further research and a precautionary approach and that children's use of mobile phones should be kept as low as possible. Other recent statements from national and international health advisory authorities have been reassuring. The US National Cancer Institute found no association between use and certain brain tumours. The American Medical Association in its Journal reported that a four year study found no link between use and brain cancer, although it recommended further work. The Royal Society of Canada found no evidence of health risks, but accepted that small biological changes may be a cause for concern. The Danish Cancer Society in a study of 420,000 Danish users found no sign of increased risk of brain or nervous system cancers.</P>
        <P>The World Health Organisation, WHO, has concluded:</P>
        <P LI="1">Present scientific information does not indicate the need for any special precautions for use of mobile phones. If individuals are concerned they might choose to limit their own or their children's RF exposure by limiting the length of calls, or using hands-free devices to keep mobile phones away from the head and body.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At present major international research projects on the possible health effects of mobile phones are being co-ordinated by the WHO international EMF project and by the EU through its COST281 Action: Potential Health Implications from Mobile Communication Systems.</P>
        <P>The International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, is the WHO agency co-ordinating the INTERPHONE study. This is an international epidemiological study that will compare the association between a number of head and brain cancers and the intensity of mobile phone use. INTERPHONE involves 13 countries in four continents. Some 10,000 cases of cancer will be investigated. The first results are expected from Scandinavia towards the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The COST281 action was launched in 2001 and promotes collaboration among European research groups working on mobile communications and health. Research initiatives are underway or at an advanced planning stage on such topics as mobile phones and children, health effects of emerging wireless technologies, health effects of phone masts, mobile communications and the brain, and mobile phones and sleep disorders.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources participates fully in the WHO International EMF project and in the COST281 action. In May 2003, I hosted a major <Col N="564"/>international meeting in Dublin of COST281 on the topic of phone masts and health. Members of my staff are currently assisting WHO on the development of exposure standards and the application of the precautionary approach to non-ionising radiation.</P>

In arriving at my decision, I had regard to a diverse range of opinions expressed during a public consultation process I conducted last year. In arriving at the view that the ban should remain I was conscious of the potential intrusive nature of advertising on radio and television, which is different to other forms of advertising. I am of the view that it is not desirable that individual groups would be in a position to buy air-time to deliver an unchallenged message that is aimed at influencing and altering behaviour in society in circumstances where it is difficult for the public to test or verify positions advanced.</P>
        <P>Section 65 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 provides that the ban on religious advertising does not preclude the broadcasting of a notice of the fact that a particular religious newspaper, magazine or periodical is available for sale or supply, or that any event or ceremony associated with any particular religion will take place. if the contents of the notice do not address the issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any <Col N="565"/>religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation.</P>

	<P>The Port of Waterford Company operates under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000. Under the Acts, the primary function of the company is the management, control, operation and development of its harbour ensuring that its revenues are sufficient to meet its expenditures. In the light of this statutory requirement the company informs me that it has been conducting a review of its non-core assets to determine the appropriateness of their retention in present circumstances.</P>
        <P>The company now provides its core facilities for ships and goods at Belview, County Kilkenny. Accordingly, the property at the North Quays is one of the company's principal non-core assets and I am informed that the company is taking the preparatory steps necessary in order to be in a position to offer the property for sale.</P>
        <P>Under the Harbours Acts, a decision to dispose of land shall only be made by the directors of the company and they are obliged to ensure that the consideration for which any land is sold shall, in so far as is practicable, not be less than its open market value. A decision by the directors to dispose of land does not require my approval under the legislation.</P>

        <P>The An Post ESOP, which was signed in 2000, provided for the transfer of up to 14.9% of the company to employees, on a phased basis, in return for specified costs savings and profits. 5% of the transfer was for transformation and 9.9% as a profit share. The purpose of the ESOP was to facilitate the transformation of An Post into a viable and profitable postal operator in order to <Col N="567"/>successfully deal with challenges arising from liberalisation and electronic substitution. In return for 5% of the company, cost savings amounting to &euro;34m were to be achieved between 2000 and 2003. However, instead of achieving savings the opposite has happened, i.e. staff costs <Col N="568"/>rose by &euro;24m between 1999 and 2000 which represents a 6% increase, by &euro;52m between 2000 and 2001 a 13% increase and by &euro;40m between 2001 and 2002, an increase of 9%.</P>

        <P>In May 2003 the An Post board advised that cost savings for 2000 set out in the ESOP amounting to &euro;7 million had been achieved. However, according to documentation supplied by An Post at that time, achievement of savings was substantially below target levels in the ESOP agreement, was delayed, and took place between 2001 and 2003 instead of in 2000. In September, 2003 An Post advised, following a review of company finances, that forecast profit of &euro;1 million had turned into a loss of &euro;29.5 million. Therefore, having regard to the substantial losses notified by An Post for 2003, the board has been asked to review the cost savings verification process and respond to the Department. We are still waiting for a response from the board of An Post on the verification of the cost savings issue. The Government is still committed to an ESOP in An Post, if and only if, it can be demonstrated that real transformation has occurred and that the cost savings envisaged in the ESOP have been achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Common Fisheries Policy review, which was adopted by the Fisheries Council in the form of a framework regulation in December 2002, sets out new provisions in respect of State financial aid towards vessels which fish on a commercial basis. These rules apply to all fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing, including small vessels such as currachs.</P>
        <P>The rules provide that a member state wishing to provide grant aid towards vessel renewal or modernisation involving increases in capacity in terms of tonnage or power or increased effectiveness of fishing gear in the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004 would have to deliver a 3% reduction in the capacity limits for its overall national fleet. Such aid is completely precluded from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>There is unlikely to be any relaxation of the EU fleet regime, which is regarded as the cornerstone of the Common Fisheries Policy. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta may therefore wish to consider, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, alternative aid schemes for fishermen which are in accord with EU legislation and national fisheries policy.</P>
        <P>The 3% penalty imposed for the continuation of grant aid to 31 December 2004 would involve, for the Irish fleet, the permanent removal of 2,496 <Col N="569"/>GT's and 6,478 KWs. This reduction would involve a substantial cost to the State and would reduce permanently the capacity limits of the fleet. In these circumstances, it was decided that the State would not enter into any grant aid in relation to fleet renewal and modernisation after 1 January 2003. This policy is regarded as a cornerstone of the reform of the CFP by the Commission and as such it cannot be expected that the Commission will bring forward any new proposal for an adjustment of the policy.</P>
        <P>The position of small fishing vessels, which did not come within the legal framework of licensing and registration, has been recently addressed. In April 2003, following securing the agreement of the EU Commission, a scheme, with a closing date of 18 June 2003, was launched to bring within the regulatory framework unlicensed and unregistered inshore fishermen. It covered fishermen who have traditionally owned a small fishing boat and have a record of active commercial pot fishing. Currachs are covered by the scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, the owners of these boats are not required to provide replacement capacity for licensing and registration which in the normal course would have to be purchased. The Department and BIM are currently processing the applications. The licensing and registration of inshore vessels is seen as the first critical step in enabling effective management and conservation measures to be put in place for inshore stocks around the coast.</P>

	<P>I have no proposals at present to merge D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and Dublin Port Company. In May 2003, I published the high level review of the State commercial ports operating under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000. The purpose of the review was to critically review the current model for the governance of the port companies.</P>
        <P>Among its many findings and recommendations, the review noted that there is a conflict between the commercial and heritage obligations of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company. The review recommended that responsibility for the cultural and heritage aspects should be transferred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and that consideration be given, on commercial and economic grounds, to merging D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and Dublin Port Company to become Dublin Bay Company.</P>
        <P>When I published the review, I also initiated a full public consultation process on its findings and recommendations. In response, my Department has received submissions from a number of parties, including the two port companies concerned, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council. All submissions are receiving careful consideration by my Department.

	<P>The EU directive on energy performance in buildings requires that Ireland put in place a system for producing energy performance certificates for its building stock. The directive obliges member states to ensure that an energy performance certificate is made available to the tenant or potential owner, when a building is constructed, sold or rented out.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has mandated the European Committee for Standardisation to devise common standards for the calculation of the energy rating of buildings and it is expected that these standards will form the basis for each member state to draw up energy rating <Col N="571"/>mechanisms suitable to their individual climates. In order to meet with this obligation as well as transposing the EU directive into national legislation, a working group has been set up to look at all aspects of the scope of the EU directive. This working group comprises representatives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as well as officials from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and representatives from Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
        <P>The question of how to introduce the energy performance certificate for a building is being considered by the working group and will take into consideration the findings of the European Committee for Standardisation when they become available.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in reply to a similar question on 18 December last, my main priority <Col N="572"/>for the Presidency, in so far as arts, sport and tourism are concerned, is to ensure that normal EU business is conducted efficiently and effectively particularly given the additional workload and complexities associated which the accession of ten new member states. In this context, I had very useful meetings in Dublin Castle on 6 January with the two Commissioners with responsibilities in the field of culture, sport and tourism, Viviane Reding and Errki Liikanen, respectively. Just yesterday, I addressed the European Parliament Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on our priorities for the Presidency.</P>
        <P>In order to advance the work programme in the field of culture, my Department will host three major events during the Presidency: a seminar on cultural and linguistic diversity in Killarney on 11 March, a seminar on the music industry in Dublin on 19 and 20 April, and a meeting of a European group on digitisation of heritage and culture to be followed by a conference on digitisation to take place in Dublin on 28 and 29 June. We are also supporting an Arts Council seminar in Cork in May which is aimed at facilitating greater networking among NGOs in the arts field.</P>
        <P>The main priority in the sports area will be the European year of education through sport. I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, will host the official European launch of the year in Croke Park on 29 January and this will be followed by a conference on the importance of sport in an educational context.</P><Col N="573"/>
        <P>While tourism <i>per se</i> is not an area of competence for the EU, Ireland recognises the importance of the tourism sector in Europe and the opportunity which the Presidency presents to consider the key issues facing the industry in a European context. In that context, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to organise a business-focused conference on competitiveness and sustainability in tourism during our Presidency. The conference will take place on 5 April in Dublin Castle.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month I formally launched the Presidency cultural programme. This extensive programme, which will see over 250 Irish artists and hundreds of European artists presenting work across the expanded EU, is one of the central features of the Irish Presidency. We have already had a very successful concert in Brussels to mark the start of the Presidency there.</P>
        <P>The new member states will be officially welcomed into the EU by an Irish city or town in a special day of welcomes on Saturday, 1 May. This day will be at the heart of a national weekend of celebration that will involve each of the ten towns and cities hosting distinct and engaging European fairs, while a fireworks extravaganza in Dublin from a leading European pyrotechnics company will commence celebrations in the capital on Friday, 30 April.</P>
        <P>Dublin will also see St. Stephen's Green transformed into a colourful bazaar with marquees, stands and stages making up the European fair on Saturday, 1 May. It is expected that over 100,000 visitors will pass through the fair over the weekend to enjoy the experience of unique and interesting produce from the new EU member states and participate in the fun cultural activity.</P>
        <P>A major concert of Irish and international stars on O'Connell Street will be a highlight of the weekend and will be produced by RT&Eacute; and the BBC. It will be broadcast live throughout Europe. The line-up for this concert will be announced in February. From a cultural, sports and tourism perspective, the Irish Presidency promises to be both exciting and rewarding for all those involved.</P>

	<P>One of the key objectives of national tourism policy is to achieve as wide as possible a distribution of visitor numbers across the different regions. Achieving that goal has long been recognised as a major challenge and is something that is fully reflected in the programmes and initiatives operated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland &mdash; the National Tourism Development Authority &mdash; by Tourism Ireland, and in the <Col N="574"/>action plan set out in the recent report by the tourism policy review group. Its report sets out a strategy for tourism that is comprehensive, coherent and challenging for both Government Departments and agencies and for the industry itself. It has put the emphasis on an agenda for action by highlighting 70 individual recommended actions that will support the development of the tourism sector over the next decade.</P>
        <P>While many of the actions proposed by the review group will have an impact on the regional distribution of tourism, key actions in this regard include those relating to product development, tourism promotion, access transport and the appropriate infrastructure and arrangements for the delivery of tourism at regional level.</P>
        <P>I have no direct responsibility in relation to individual actions or measures relating to tourism promotion or development insofar as specific areas of the country are concerned, as these are a day-to-day function of the tourism State agencies. However, the Deputy may wish to note that a number of programmes and initiatives particularly favour the regional distribution of tourists. These include the nature and focus of the tourism product development scheme, the differential levels of support offered to regional tourism authorities for marketing purposes, the use of predominantly rural imagery in the advertising and promotion of Ireland, both at home and abroad, the regional coverage with respect to visiting media and the specific focus on achieving a wide spread of visitors in relation to access transport policies.</P>

No application has been submitted from CFT, or indeed any other organisation, in recent years in respect of such a facility in Munster.</P>
        <P>The application from CFT, like all others under the programme, will be evaluated against the 2004 programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. In this instance, my Department will also be consulting with the Department of Health and Children, which is currently in discussions with the Western Health Board regarding proposals for replacing the recompression chamber in Galway. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the sports capital programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

To that end, a decentralisation committee has been established within my Department which will plan the programme in respect of this Department in liaison with the central committee. As Minister, I will be driving the implementation of the programme in the Department and reporting on a regular basis to the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>

	<P>The health sector reform programme has implications for all organisations in the health sector both in terms of structures and in terms of governance, accountability, planning, monitoring and evaluation. Fundamental reform of the existing statutory provisions in relation to the roles, organisation structure and management of the health system will be required to give effect to the proposals contained in the reform programme.</P>
        <P>The Government's legislation programme makes provision for the enactment of legislation to give statutory effect where required to implement the proposals in the reform programme. The first element of the programme is the preparation of an establishment order under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 as amended, establishing the interim Health Services Executive on a statutory basis. The order is being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to sign it by the end of this month. This will empower the interim executive to carry out the set up tasks and preparations necessary to enable an orderly transfer of functions to the HSE when permanently established by new legislation in January 2005.</P>
        <P>It will be necessary to introduce new legislation to provide the main legislative basis for the implementation of the health sector reform <Col N="581"/>programme. It will establish the new Health Service Executive to replace the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. It will also provide the legislative basis for other aspects of the reform programme such as improved governance and accountability, planning and monitoring and evaluation. The establishment of the health information and quality authority (HIQA) on a legislative basis will also be provided for. It is also my intention that the new legislation will include provision for a statutory framework for complaints procedures in the health services as proposed in the health strategy. My intention is to have this legislation introduced by December 2004 so as to have the Health Services Executive in place in January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government has also indicated its intention in the legislation programme for the spring session to introduce a health (amendment) Bill to cope with the situation which will arise following the local election in June 2004. Given the impending establishment of, and formal transfer of functions to the Health Service Executive, the Government has considered whether it would be appropriate to proceed in the normal way with the appointment of local representatives to the health boards. I intend discussing this matter further with the association of health boards at a meeting to be arranged in the near future. Following that meeting, I will be making a public announcement on the Governments intentions in this regard.</P>
        <P>With respect to the specific issue of legislation in relation to medical staff, the National Task Force on Medical Staffing (the Hanly report) noted that Ireland is required to ensure that the provisions of the European Working Time Directive apply to doctors in training from 1 August 2004. The directive was transposed into Irish law by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. At present doctors in training are excluded from these provisions. My Department is at present holding discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to the introduction of the necessary statutory instrument to apply these provisions to doctors in training.</P>

	<P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children who cannot, for a number of reasons, be looked after in their own home. In August 2001, the foster care allowance was substantially increased, alleviating the need for foster parents to apply to health boards for every extra financial need of their foster child or children. The current rates of payment are &euro;289.50 per week for a child under 12 years and &euro;316.50 per week for a child of 12 years and over. The number of children in foster care at 31 December 2003 and funding provided to foster carers in 2003 is as follows:</P><Col N="583"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The Medical Practitioners Act 1978 established the Medical Council as the body responsible for <Col N="584"/>the registration and regulation of the activities of medical practitioners. The activities of those engaged in alternative medicine are not regulated by the council, as the entitlement to registration requires a primary qualification in medicine from a specified body within the State, by a competent body or authority from another EU member state or by virtue of an agreement with a number of other states outside of the EU.</P>
        <P>Draft legislative proposals providing for further, wide-ranging amendments to the 1978 <Col N="585"/>Act are currently in the final stages of preparation in my Department, and draft heads of bill are due to be brought to Cabinet in the very near future. One of the primary concerns of the amending legislation will be to provide for increased public protection. A proposed new provision for an improved complaints mechanism will empower the Medical Council to investigate on its own initiative, or at the behest of the Minister or any member of the public, instances or reports of individuals claiming to be medical practitioners or providing services proper only to registered medical practitioners. This would permit the council to report its findings to the Minister and for the council to take appropriate action.</P>
        <P>There are currently no proposals to introduce legislation to regulate practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. However, in order to strengthen the regulatory environment for complementary therapists, my Department convened a forum in June 2001 to examine and explore practical issues involved, with particular regard to ensuring that the public is appropriately informed and guided.</P>
        <P>Arising from the work of the forum my Department requested the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward taking into consideration the formal views of the representative groups that participated in the forum. The report, which was published in November 2002, delivers on action 106 of the Health Strategy &mdash; Quality and Fairness, and makes a number of recommendations on proposals for the way forward including the establishment of a working group to examine and consider regulatory issues; the continuation and development of a consultation process; and support for individual therapies in developing or strengthening their systems of self-regulation.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the report, I established a national working group in May last year to progress the programme of work set out in the report and address its recommendations in order to advise me on future measures for the regulation of complementary therapists. The working group has met on five occasions and I understand it will be continuing its work in 2004.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the aim of the home help service is to enable people to remain living at home, where appropriate, who would otherwise need to be cared for in long-stay residential care and that this service is an essential support to families and informal carers. The home help service by its nature is a flexible service which is designed to respond to clients' needs. The service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients in accordance with their assessed need. As a result, therefore, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time. To ensure effective prioritisation of the service, assessments are undertaken at local sector level and are carried out by the public health nursing services.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons why demand for home help service have been increasing, such as <Col N="587"/>demographic factors. Approximately 6,000 additional people come into the over-65 bracket every year and that there has been a proportionately higher percentage increase in the more dependent over-80 category. These factors may necessitate some minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service. Basically, what this means is that, although a small percentage of clients may have had their hours <Col N="588"/>reduced, this has been counter-balanced by others receiving the service for the first time. I have been assured by all health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that the most vulnerable clients are given priority.</P>
        <P>The following table illustrates funding allocated to the home help service by health board area in 2003 and the percentage increase in funding for this service as compared with 2000:</P><Col N="587"/>

        <P FLI="0">The total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas since 2000 is 113.59%. The Deputy might also wish to note that an additional &euro;3.748 million has been allocated by my Department to this service in 2004.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State I have been encouraging the authority and the health boards to introduce home care packages including home based subvention for clients applying for nursing home subvention as an alternative to long-stay residential care. The criteria that applies for home based subvention is the same that applies for nursing home subvention. I am pleased to advise that a number of health boards are developing personal care packages that are more focussed on individual care needs, for example, public health nurse service, attendance at day care, day hospital and rehabilitation, and the provision of respite care, home help and care assistance.</P>
        <P>In respect of the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the provision of health services in County Wexford rests with the South Eastern Health Board. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply direct to him as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The emphasis of the Child Care Act 1991 is on supporting children and families in their own communities having regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of the child to be brought up in his or her own family. However, children are taken into the care of the health boards or placed voluntarily in care due to a range of family circumstances and health boards have a statutory responsibility to provide appropriate services for these children.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, additional revenue funding of approximately &euro;185 million has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children collects annual figures in relation to children in care through the interim minimum dataset. Figures for 2001 indicate that there were 3,656 children in foster care, some with extra supports as required, and 569 children in residential care including high support and special care.</P>
        <P>As the figures show foster care is the main form of alternative care for children who cannot be looked after in their own home. The essential role of foster carers in providing a home for children and young people whose parents are unable to care for them is well recognised by Government. The working group report on foster care published in 2001 contains a wide range of recommendations designed to ensure that the structures and services necessary to meet the needs of children in foster care, their families and foster carers are strengthened and further developed. The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report on a phased basis. Among the recommendations <Col N="589"/>implemented to date are a substantial increase in the foster care allowance and development and publication of national standards for foster care. Pilot inspections by the social services inspectorate of the implementation of the standards are due to commence shortly. These initiatives together with initiatives undertaken by health boards on an ongoing basis will improve the quality of foster care services and encourage new foster care applicants.</P>
        <P>Residential care best meets the needs of some children at a particular time in their lives or is sometimes appropriate as a means of keeping a larger sibling group together. As the Deputy may be aware the number of high support and special care places has increased to over 120 to cater for a small group of children who cannot be catered for in mainstream residential care or in foster care. While this has been necessary, I am committed to developing alternative community based services for this group, for example, the youth advocacy pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and Western Health Board which commenced in 2002. In addition, extern, a voluntary organisation has agreements with a number of health boards to provide intensive community based services for at risk children. These programmes provide an added dimension to the health boards provision of community based services to meet the needs of at risk children.</P>
        <P>All types of residential care are inspected either by the social services inspectorate or the registration and inspection units of the health boards, as appropriate, to ensure and promote a quality standard of care in line with legislation and national standards.</P>
        <P>With the shift in policy in recent years to a more preventive approach to child welfare involving support for families and individual children, increased funding has been provided for a wide range of family support projects, preventative services and intensive community based services. These include the springboard initiative and teen parent support programme and a range of programmes developed or supported by health boards ranging from the community mothers scheme to lifestart and homestart and support for pre-school services for at risk children. These projects provide support and practical help to families in a non-stigmatising way. A review of family support services has also been established by my Department which will map out a national policy and plan for the future development of family support services by health boards. This review is expected to report at the end of 2004.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I will continue to ensure that the supports are in place to allow children to be cared for by their own family where possible and that care services and in particular residential care services are for as short a period as possible and of a standard which best meets the needs of children in care.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the number of special care units for children at risk; the number of children currently in special care units; and the number of children seeking a place in these units.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Special care units provide secure care intervention for a small group of non-offending children in need of special care or protection on foot of a court order of detention. The placing of a child in a special care unit should only be considered as a last resort and for as short a period of time as possible when other forms of residential or community care are deemed to be unsuitable.</P>
        <P>There are three designated special care units with a total capacity of 30 special care places. These are the Ballydowd special care unit in the eastern region operated by the South Western Area Health Board which provides a national service caring for boys and girls; the Gleann Alainn special care unit in the Southern Health Board area which caters for girls only and Coovagh House special care unit in the Mid-Western Health Board area which opened recently on a phased basis and caters for boys only. The Coovagh House and Gleann Alainn units provide a regional service for the Southern, South Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards concerned that there are currently eight children in Ballydowd special care unit, one child in Coovagh House special care unit and four children in Gleann Alainn special care unit.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that in addition to the eight children currently placed in Ballydowd special care unit, places have been offered to three other children considered to be in need of special care or protection. There is no waiting list for places in Ballydowd special care unit at present. The Mid-Western Health Board has informed me that an application was received recently from the Southern Health Board for the placement of a child in Coovagh House special care unit and this will be considered at the next admission's meeting for the unit. In relation to Gleann Alainn special care unit the Southern Health Board has indicated that there is one girl due to be placed there by the end of January and an application for the placement of another girl is currently being processed.</P>
        <P>Occasionally a health board may, because of the particular circumstances of the case and the individual needs of the child, provide an individual special care arrangement and the Western Health Board has informed me that it has one such arrangement in place at present.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that approximately &euro;185 million in additional revenue funding has been invested in the development of child welfare services since 1997. Part of this investment has <Col N="591"/>allowed for significant progress to be made in putting in place services to cater for non-offending children with behavioural problems to obviate the need for special care placement and to facilitate children detained in special care units being stepped down to open residential and community based services as quickly as possible. These include the development of over 80 residential high support places and the putting in place of a number of intensive community based services such as the youth advocacy pilot programmes in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board and the provision of intensive community services to various health boards by the extern organisation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
        <P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board-authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. However, it should be noted that the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards <Col N="596"/>when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that increases in social welfare rates in recent years have given rise to a situation where such rates may exceed the income guidelines for a medical card. Because of this situation, my Department has written to the chairman of the chief executive officers' group on a number of occasions, most recently on 5 November 2003, asking that he advise the CEOs of my concern that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged by virtue of increases in social welfare payments which may be announced in the forthcoming budget. They were asked to ensure that increases in social welfare payments do not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards by reference to the income guidelines and to make every effort to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</P>

        <P>A project team was established in May 2001 to progress this development. The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee general hospital. The selected site is a three acre site, accessible from the Killerisk road, which will allow for the community nursing unit to be developed independently from the general hospital campus.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>The design team has completed the stage three report, which was submitted by the Southern Health Board on the 23 December 2003.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 683, 685 and 695 together.</P>
        <P>Recently Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al published its report of the committee to review neurology and neurophysiology services. I am happy to endorse its recommendations for a significant enhancement of services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry that are related to an overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multidisciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework on the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. It will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications, will offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services here.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and with the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association on the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in the area, competing funding priorities and the report of the national task force on medical staffing.</P>

	<P>Waiting times associated with the cervical cytology service in the eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The details of the individual were supplied by the Deputy. They have been sent to the regional chief executive of the ERHA with a request that the matter be investigated and that he issue a response directly to her. The authority has stated that if a test is notified as clinically urgent, results will usually be returned within one to three weeks. Waiting times can vary between four and 16 weeks for routine screening.</P>
        <P>Over recent years I have provided additional funding to support the ongoing development of cervical cytology laboratory and coloscopy services within the ERHA. This was done with a view to achieving improved services, in particular, waiting times for cervical smear test results. In 2004 additional funding of &euro;0.440 million was allocated to the ERHA as part of a programme of continued investment in the area.</P>
        <P>The authority's objective is to reduce the turnaround time for processing routine smears. The initiatives taken include overtime, faster screening technology in the region and the outsourcing of cervical cytology to external laboratories.</P>
        <P>The authority allocated additional funding to its screening agencies to introduce liquid based technology. This involved investment in new equipment and at present all staff, from smear takers to laboratory staff, are being trained to use it. Liquid based cytology smears are easier and quicker to screen but the cost of consumables is more expensive than the traditional PAP method. It is expected that the additional expense will be balanced by a quicker screening time and a reduction in processing time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The cost per attendance includes direct pay and non-pay costs together with allocations of various medical services, laboratories and overheads such as maintenance and administration.</P>
        <P>There are a number of factors that influence the cost per attendance. For example, cost allocation methodology and physical layout of a department. A major factor is the number of patients attending. The number of attendances for the hospitals listed above ranges between 25,868 for the James Connolly Memorial Hospital to 72,678 for the Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospital.</P>
        <P>Hospitals must always be able to treat complex emergency cases. It is a major fixed cost in the running of an accident and emergency department. This, together with the throughput issue, are the main reasons for the variation in cost per attendance outlined above.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 688, 689 and 691 together.</P>
        <P>The use of seclusion and mechanical constraint has been largely eliminated from mental health care. However, in a small number of instances such measures are utilised as a last resort. In The Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services, issued to service providers by the inspector of mental hospitals, the proper safeguards and precautions governing the use, as a last resort, of seclusion and mechanical constraint are outlined. Some <Col N="607"/>recommendations are as follows: only a consultant psychiatrist may prescribe such treatments in writing; the decision should be reviewed every six hours; a patient should be visited by a nurse and observations recorded and documented every 15 minutes; and a separate care plan must be maintained for patients where such measures are required, recording information on events and the actual behaviour and interventions used prior to the episode.</P>
        <P>Recently the Mental Health Commission appointed Dr. Teresa Carey to the new position of inspector of mental health services. It replaces the office of inspector of mental hospitals. The inspector is required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. She will monitor implementation of the guidelines during her annual inspection of each service.</P>
        <P>In recent times many psychiatric hospitals and acute units provide multi-sensory rooms for patients where a calm and quiet atmosphere is created to help patients relax. Such facilities are most helpful to patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 692 and 693 together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services in County Mayo rests with the Western Health Board. It has advised my Department that the hospice unit was officially opened on 23 January 1999. The cost of refurbishing it amounted to &euro;222,204.16 and it consists of two inpatient beds. Its occupancy rates when it was open were in the region of 95%. Unfortunately, the inpatient beds have not been available for some time due to the absence of a medical officer.</P>
        <P>The board has had difficulty in filling the post of medical director to service the hospice unit. It was advertised in the national newspapers on three previous occasions. The advertisements contained details of the remuneration package available. It is in line with national pay rates for the grade. The board is in the process of readvertising the post in conjunction with a post of general practitioner for the Foxford-Straide area. It hopes that the new advertisement will generate a positive response and the post will be filled.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by pharmacists at the implications of EU Directive 85/433/EC that gives member states the option of not recognising the qualification of an EU or EEA qualified pharmacist in relation to ownership, management or supervision of a pharmacy that is less than three years old, while no such restriction applies to pharmacists from outside the EU or <Col N="609"/>EEA area; if he intends to take steps to address this anomaly during the Irish Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the derogation available under Article 2.2 of Directive 85/433/EEC on the free movement of pharmacists, EU or EEA pharmacists who qualified in another EU or EEA state cannot own in their own right, operate or manage a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old.</P>
        <P>The derogation was implemented in Ireland through the European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications In Pharmacy) Regulations 1987 (S.I. No. 239 of 1987) and European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications In Pharmacy) Regulations 1991 (S.I . No. 330 of 1991). These regulations do not preclude such pharmacists from working in a pharmacy less than three years old, other than as a supervising pharmacist.</P>
        <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is responsible for the registration of pharmacists and for the recognition of non-EU pharmacy qualifications. It currently has reciprocal arrangements with its counterparts in Australia and New Zealand that recognises the pharmacy qualifications of these countries. Therefore, the EU derogation does not apply to pharmacists from those countries.</P>
        <P>The pharmacy review group considered the issue of the derogation and I am examining the complex legal and other issues surrounding its recommendations. Consideration will be given to Ireland's use of the derogation on completion of my examination.</P>

	<P>My Department's policy on the recruitment of overseas nurses is set out in Guidance for Best Practice on the Recruitment of Overseas Nurses and Midwives published in 2001. It covers all aspects of the recruitment process including planning, staff selection, visas and work permits, provision of advice before leaving home, the procedures for gaining registration in Ireland and induction, orientation and adaptation on arrival. It was developed by a committee of experts from Departments and the health service employers and represents current best practice. The guiding principles underlying the policies are quality, ethical recruitment, equity, inclusiveness and promotion of nursing as a career.</P>
        <P>Supports provided to overseas nurses arriving to work in the health service include supervised clinical practice, orientation and assessment. A full-time clinical placement co-ordinator is employed to facilitate this. Nurses are paid at the minimum point of the staff nurse scale during this period and are given full incremental credit for relevant nursing experience following registration. Overseas nurses enjoy the same employment protection as Irish and EU nurses and have the same career development supports and opportunities.</P>
        <P>Employers are required to assist overseas nurses in obtaining registration with An Bord Altranais and work permits, visas and work authorisations can also be provided. Employers should provide subsidised accommodation for six weeks following arrival and assist nurses in securing long-term private accommodation.</P><Col N="611"/>
        <P>In 2000 the chairperson of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals recruitment and retention group met officials from the Ministry for Health in India. It positively supports recruitment of nurses from India by the Irish health service.</P>
        <P>Overseas nurses are making an invaluable contribution to the health service and we are pleased to have them. Overseas nurses gain good professional experience while in Ireland and it will enhance their contribution to nursing when they return home.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a person over the age of 65 years is not entitled to a motorised transport grant; if the age limit complies with age discrimination legislation; the plans he has to review the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines for the motorised transport grant were revised in July 2002, in accordance with recommendations by the national health board working group on disability related allowances-grants that came under the aegis of my Department.</P>
        <P>The revised circular states that all health boards may pay a grant towards the purchase of a car and-or to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age to be adapted, where such a car is essential for him or her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered subject to the above age limits. In cases where application is made on the basis of obtaining or retaining employment or self-employment, the board must be satisfied that the applicant is capable of holding down a job, has the physical capacity to drive the vehicle and is qualified to hold a full or provisional driver's licence. Qualified persons with a disability who are incapable of driving or who have been medically advised not to drive, and must be driven to and from his or her place of employment will only be considered eligible for a grant provided that he or she will be driven by another named person to and from his or her place of employment. The car must be purchased in the name of the person with a disability. The grant may also be considered in exceptional circumstances for a person with a severe disability, subject to the above age limits, who lives in a remote location and whose disability impedes him or her from using public transport.</P>
        <P>The grant is primarily aimed at people with disabilities to enable them to obtain or retain employment. Therefore, it is felt the upper age limit of 65 years of age is appropriate. The working group has made various recommendations about age limits and eligibility criteria for the grant. At present my Department <Col N="612"/>is examining the issue of age limits for mobility related allowances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The national health board review group on Department of Health and Children disability allowances and grant schemes was established to review certain Department of Health and Children disability allowances and grant schemes. The review group finalised draft circulars, which were issued by the <Col N="616"/>Department of Health and Children to all health boards in July 2002, to standardise the procedures used at all health board levels for the operation of the various allowances and grants. The circular confirms the purpose of mobility allowance as an allowance that: &ldquo;provides financial support to eligible people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &mdash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The circular on the motorised transport grant states:</P>
        <P LI="1">a Health Board may pay a grant towards the purchase of a car and/or adaptions to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age, where such a car is essential for him/her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered (subject to the above age limits).</P>
        <P>Therefore the two schemes are mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the 1968 circular on motorised transport grant stated: &ldquo;the making of grants should be on the condition that the health authority will not be called upon at any future date to contribute towards the running expenses.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The revised motorised grant circulars reiterate this position by confirming that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The payment of a motorised transport grant is subject to the condition that the health board will not be called upon at any future date to contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle. In this context, a mobility allowance recipient cannot qualify for the motorised transport grant. Similarly, a person who has received the motorised transport grant in the previous three years cannot qualify for mobility allowance. Where a mobility allowance recipient wishes to avail of a motorised transport grant, mobility allowance should cease from the date of payment of the motorised transport grant."</P>

	<P>The 2004 determination for the Western Health Board is &euro;780.059 million, which is an increase on 9.98% over the 2003 revised base determination. The method used for deciding on the determination for any health board relates to the base level of approved funding being carried over from the previous year, increased by overall adjustments for specific services, pay increases, demand led schemes, casemix and inflation factors and other service developments, together with once-off funding not repeated in the current year. The decisions on the determinations are informed by ongoing discussions during the previous year between health boards and my Department in the context of delivering services within the approved budget.</P>
        <P>While adjustments for technical items &mdash; pay issues and inflation &mdash; are applied on a consistent basis across boards, specific service adjustments are determined by policy considerations and the needs of individual catchment areas. Such decisions can affect the base determination, the current year determination and the comparison as between those. As I understand from preliminary figures for 2003, the board, once again, performed very well against its service plan targets and financial budget. In particular, acute hospital output increased over 2002 levels (based on the latest available data) and, overall, it gained some &euro;1.66 million in the casemix adjustments in 2004. The Western Health Board gained more than any other board for the casemix adjustment for 2004. The adjustments made to the Western Health Board determination for 2004 are entirely consistent with the approach taken with other boards and health agencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 738 and 794 together.</P>
        <P>On 25 July 2003 I published the report of Mr. Kevin Bonner on Monaghan General Hospital. I indicated, at that time, my acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I have also accepted that additional services can be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular, I welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity of the hospital within the Cavan-Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff within this new structure is a very significant <Col N="624"/>development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.</P>
        <P>Mr. Bonner has recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service delivery is changing worldwide and that Monaghan hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In this context, the report's recommendations in relation to the range and configuration of acute services to be delivered within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group are appropriate for consideration by the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department is informed that the North Eastern Health Board has set up a project group to implement the findings of the Bonner report and that a project manager has been appointed to support the group. The project group is due to meet tomorrow 28 January, 2004.</P>
        <P>The recently published national task force on medical staffing &mdash; Hanly &mdash; report will further inform decisions in relation to the future configuration of acute hospital services. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European working time directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the Forum on Medical Manpower.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the recommendations in the Bonner report, I am making additional capital funding available to the North Eastern Health Board under the national development plan. In this context, my Department has recently received proposals from the board on capital needs at Monaghan General Hospital in areas such as refurbishment, fire precaution and other health and safety measures. My Department is currently examining these proposals.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that there are a range of community supports in place for patients when discharged from hospital. Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have encouraged the authority and the health boards to develop their services to more focused individual care need e.g. public health nurse service, attendance at day care, day hospital and rehabilitation, and the provision of respite care, home help and care assistance, which also provided for home based subvention as an alternative to long-stay residential care.</P>
        <P>The level of support provided depends on the persons needs, age, family supports, etc. The <Col N="625"/>normal procedure on discharge from hospital, an individual's needs are assessed by their own GP in consultation with the geriatrician and the public health nurse, where necessary.</P>

	<P>The state enrolled nurse, SEN, qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised in this country. The qualification was awarded following successful completion of a two year training programme. This programme, which is no longer provided in the UK, did not meet the minimum theoretical and clinical instruction requirements as set out in the relevant EU directives on nurse education programmes.</P>
        <P>Persons who have obtained the SEN qualification must undertake a nursing conversion programme in the United Kingdom in order to qualify for registration as a nurse in Ireland. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide such a programme here because the rules of the UK regulatory authority for nursing only allow for a maximum of 10% of the clinical component of the programme to take place outside the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>I introduced a special initiative in February 2001 to assist state enrolled nurses undertaking nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom. Under this initiative any SEN working in the Irish health service who wishes to undertake such a programme is entitled to receive a non means-tested grant of &euro;7,618 towards the costs involved in attending the programme in the United Kingdom. Payment of the grant is subject to the person in question giving a written undertaking that s/he will work as a nurse in the Irish health service following registration with An Bord Altranais. Some 110 SENs have benefited from the initiative to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the North Western Health Board (NWHB) area and on a national basis.</P>
        <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards &mdash; including one from the NWHB &mdash; for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the <Col N="628"/>creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The NWHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.273 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.178 million was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
        <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The NWHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.285 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
        <P>The waiting times for orthodontic treatment by county is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, the chief executive officer of the NWHB has been requested to provide the information requested directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the NWHB has informed my Department that at the end of the September 2003 quarter, the average waiting time for category A and category B orthodontic treatment was six months and 2.6 years respectively. The chief executive officer of the NWHB also informed my Department that at the end of the September 2003 quarter, there were 2,952 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board's area. This is an increase of 853 patients in orthodontic treatment when <Col N="629"/>compared with the number of patients receiving treatment at the end of December 2001.</P>

	<P>The Government has not made a decision on this matter to date. One of the specific issues referred to the interim Health Service Executive is to recommend regional boundaries and location of regional headquarters for primary, community and continuing care services and appropriate management structures.</P>
        <P>A discussion paper on possible regional administrative boundaries has been prepared as part of Phase 1 of the implementation of the health reform programme. It is being made available to the board of the interim Health Services Executive shortly for their consideration. I am asking the board to give this particular aspect of its work some priority and to let me have its recommendations as early as possible for consideration by the Government.</P>
        <P>It is clear that any evaluation of appropriate geographic boundaries for the four administrative regions should be based on evidence. The Deputy should note that the regional split refers to the primary, community and continuing care directorate of the Health Service Executive only. The initial discussions have considered possible criteria such as, for example, integration with the rest of the system with particular regard to acute hospital services, respect for existing community care structures and the national spatial strategy among others. I anticipate that the board of the interim Health Service Executive will give these, <Col N="630"/>and possibly additional criteria, consideration as part of their examination of the issue.</P>

	<P>Organisation reform is one of six frameworks for change identified in the national health strategy with the aim of providing a responsive, adaptable health system which meets the needs of the population effectively and at affordable cost. Both the prospectus report on audit of structures and functions in the health system and the report of the Commission on Financial Management and Control set out a series of measures to strengthen governance and accountability at every level in the system. The reform programme, based on the Government decision of 17 June 2003, incorporates the main conclusions from both reports.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the reform programme includes: the establishment of a single national body for managing and delivering health services &mdash; the Health Service Executive; a new legislative framework which will clearly define the role, functions and accountability of all key actors; the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority; improved information and management systems; and a statutory framework for complaint procedures in the health services among other measures.</P>
        <P>In regard to public accountability, the respective roles of the chief executive officer of the board of the Health Service Executive will be made explicit in the legislation to be introduced. I will also continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of my role and responsibilities and the relevant Oireachtas committees, for example, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Committee of Public Accounts will continue to exercise their respective roles.</P>
        <P>In regard to the involvement of public representatives at local level, I have indicated that I will be bringing forward proposals in this regard, building on the ideas already outlined for consultation at regional level. Proposals are being prepared in my Department and I have indicated my intention to discuss this matter with the Association of Health Boards at a meeting in the near future.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There has been a steady decline in the number of bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, cases notified each year since 2000, when 586 cases were reported nationally. This decline can largely be attributed to the success of the meningococcal group C &mdash; men C &mdash; vaccination campaign which commenced in 2000. In 2000, 139 cases of group C meningococcal disease were notified in Ireland. This declined to 35 in 2001, 14 in 2002 and just five group C cases in 2003. This represents an overall reduction of 96% in the number of group C cases notified in 2003, compared to 2000.</P>
        <P>Following the increase in viral meningitis activity in 2000 and 2001, activity returned to baseline levels, namely, the level of activity normally expected, in 2002 and 2003. I understand from the National Disease Surveillance Centre that the higher than usual level of activity for viral meningitis in 2000-01 was also reported by the United Kingdom at the time. The increase in viral meningitis activity was attributed to certain strains of enteroviruses in circulation at that time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Child Care Act 1991 is kept under review by my Department. As the Deputy will be aware, the Child Care Act 1991 is comprehensive legislation, which obliges the health boards to provide a wide range of services, from the promotion of the welfare of children to the protection of children at risk, the taking of children into care, the provision of child care and family support services and the supervision and inspection of pre-school services and residential care services. The Act also places responsibilities on the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the making of regulations, the inspection of health board provided services and the provision of funding.</P>
        <P>In meeting their statutory obligations, health boards develop and deliver, either directly or through arrangements with other agencies, a wide range of services designed to respond to the needs of children and families in their areas. Health boards commission or carry out a significant number of reviews and evaluations to assess how well these services are meeting the identified needs and boards respond to the outcome of these evaluations by reconfiguring existing services or developing new services. In addition, health boards, as part of their strategic planning, prioritise available resources taking into account allocation of funding versus service outcomes and the creation of a balance between prevention, child protection and through care.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the Act requires health boards to provide an annual report on the adequacy of child care and family support services in its area to the Minister for Health and Children. This assists the Department of Health and Children in reviewing services provided by, or on behalf of, the health boards under the Child Care Act 1991. As regards care proceedings, the Act provides for an appeal to the court to vary or discharge any court order made under the Act.</P>
        <P>There are a number of initiatives at national level which are designed to ensure that health boards are supported, guided and monitored in meeting their statutory obligations under the Child Care Act 1991, and which, <i>inter alia</i>, fulfil <Col N="635"/>the Minister's obligations under the Act. These include: regulations and standards developed under the Act in the area of residential care, foster care and pre-school services; the establishment of the social services inspectorate and the monitoring and inspection by the inspectorate of health board operated residential care services based on the legislation and standards, with the inspection of the implementation of foster care standards due to commence shortly; the review of regulations made under the Act with regard to pre-school services which is currently at an advanced stage; the allocation of funding; independent evaluation of the pilot phase of Department of Health and Children initiated projects such as the Springboard project and teen parents support programme in advance of mainstreaming; a review of family support services which has been established by the Department and is under way; the monitoring by the social services inspectorate of the implementation of Children First &mdash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which provides guidance on the identification and reporting of child abuse; the recent appointment of the Ombudsman for Children whose remit includes dealing with complaints and promoting the needs and interests of children; the national children's strategy which provides the means for listening to and acting more effectively for children; statistics on child care activity returned to the Department of Health and Children annually through the interim data set; performance indicators returned quarterly to the Department of Health and Children; and the monitoring of the health boards' child care service plans by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the health boards and the Department of Health and Children, in supporting the Minister, are discharging their statutory responsibilities under the Act. I assure the Deputy that in conjunction with the health boards I will continue to ensure that the implementation of the range of services provided under the Child Care Act 1991 are appropriately monitored and evaluated.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The percentage allocation to the mental health services of the total non-capital budget for the health services in 1990, 1995 and 2000 is as follows: 1990 &mdash; 10.7%; 1995 &mdash; 9.3%; and 2000 &mdash; 7.7%. When evaluating these figures, it must be borne in mind that in-patient care has always been the costliest element of the mental health service and, with the consistent reduction in psychiatric hospital bed numbers, and the ongoing transfer of intellectually disabled and elderly patients to other settings, it is to be expected that expenditure proportionate to medical and surgical services would fall.</P>
        <P>In recent years, significant additional resources have been committed to developing a comprehensive, community based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients, from 5,192 in 1997 to 3,966 in 2002, with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services. There are now 411 community psychiatric residences providing 3,146 places, compared to 391 residences providing 2,878 places in 1997.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, approximately &euro;90 million additional revenue funding has been invested in the mental health services. In the main, this funding is being used to provide additional medical and health professional staff for expanding community mental health services, increase child and adolescent services, expand the old age psychiatry services, provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, five new acute psychiatric units have opened at the Mercy Hospital, Cork, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin, Ennis General Hospital, Clare, St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny <Col N="639"/>and Mayo General Hospital. There are now 21 acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and several further units are pending.</P>
        <P>The Revised Estimates Volume for 2004, including the estimated health expenditure by programme, is being compiled and will be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>The mobility allowance was introduced in 1979 by Circular 15/79 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act 1970. Mobility allowance is payable by the health boards, subject to a means test, to persons with a severe disability. Applicants must be 16 years or older and under 66 years. The allowance provides financial support to eligible people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
        <P>Eligible persons must reside at home or in any long-stay facility. Such eligible persons can continue to receive payment after they reach the age of 66 years, provided they were receiving the allowance prior to their 66th birthday. Persons aged 66 years or over who apply are not eligible. The allowance is paid on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P>A motorised transport grant, MTG, of up to 75% of the actual cost of purchasing-adapting a car, which takes into account the trade in value of a car being replaced, may be provided up to a limit of &euro;4,575. Where a person qualifies for both the MTG and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, the MTG grant payable should not exceed the net outlay incurred, taking into account the benefit of the disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme.</P>
        <P>The payment of a motorised transport grant is subject to the condition that the health board will not be called upon at any future date to contribute towards the running cost of the vehicle. In this context, a mobility allowance recipient cannot qualify for the motorised transport grant. Similarly, a person who has received the motorised transport grant in the previous three years cannot qualify for the mobility allowance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities and will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001. This has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. In June 2002, my Department provided <Col N="642"/>additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that at the end of the September quarter 2003, there were 20,784 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that more than twice as many children are receiving orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated, and nearly 3,500 extra children have been receiving treatment from health boards since the end of 2001.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The chief executive officer of each individual health board has responsibility for the management of the workforce, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed within that board, in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the authorised ceiling. Hence, the recruitment of health service staff in 2004 will take place in the context of the implementation of each health board's service plan.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note the increase in the approved employment level from 1997 to end 2003 was 27,985 &mdash; 41% &mdash; bringing the approved employment ceiling to 95,800 in whole-time equivalent terms, excluding home helps.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development, which have all played a part in increasing staffing levels. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body will make a further contribution to recruitment and improved retention. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, also contributed significantly to meeting the workforce needs of the health services, particularly in professions where qualified staff are scarce, to meet the human resource needs of the health services.</P>
        <P>The implementation of these and similar developments will make an important contribution to strengthening the capacity of the health services to recruit and retain the high calibre professionals required in all disciplines to <Col N="643"/>fill challenging and demanding roles central to the delivery of quality health and social care services to the public. It is, however, important to emphasise that staffing requirements overall must be viewed in the context of the substantial increases in employment levels achieved in the health services in recent years.</P>
        <P>Comparing the latest available employment levels &mdash; September 2003 &mdash; to those in 1997, there are 22.2%, or 6,063, more nurses, 36.8%, or 1,832, more medical-dental personnel, and more than double &mdash; 112% &mdash; the number of health and social care professionals, an increase of 6,971, employed in the health services. This is a considerable achievement which reflects the success of the steps taken to increase the attractiveness of employment in the health services and also the ongoing measures being taken in areas experiencing shortages of fully trained and qualified staff.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious that, in view of the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, it is imperative that a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning be developed further and aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services. The issue of skill mix is also of paramount importance in meeting human resource needs. Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full potential and optimise their contribution to quality care.</P>
        <P>I am, however, well aware that in addition to effective planning to ensure the continued availability of a qualified, competent workforce, it is also necessary for the health service to become an employer of choice to further improve potential for recruitment and retention. While the record number of staff recruited into the health service in recent years shows the progress made in this regard, even more can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Having recruited and developed such a large number of staff in recent years, it is a priority to retain them by offering a challenging and rewarding career path. In the human capital and skills intensive health sector, retention has been identified as a key issue in better people management. The continuing implementation of the Action Plan for People Management is playing a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff, while providing the opportunity for each member of the workforce in the health sector to maximise his or her contribution to the creation of a quality, patient centred health service in line with the objectives of the health strategy.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Comhairle recently published the report of the committee to review neurology and neurophysiology services and I am happy to endorse its recommendations for a significant enhancement of services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multidisciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications, will offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association with regard to the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing.</P><Col N="645"/>

	<P>There has been a significant increase in the consultant manpower needed to deliver cardiac surgery and orthopaedic services in the past ten years. Based on figures provided by Comhairle na nOspideal the number of cardiothoracic surgeons increased from six to 11 between 1993 and 2003 and the number of orthopaedic surgeons increased from 52 to 76 in the same period.</P>
        <P>Plans and developments are in place which will increase the capacity for cardiac surgery. For example, the theatre and critical care complex, completed as part of the phase two development at University College Hospital, Galway, includes provision for cardiac surgery facilities. Approval has also been given to the Southern Health Board to proceed with the planning and construction of a new &euro;82 million cardiac and renal dialysis building at Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>With regard to orthopaedic services, the North Eastern Health Board has re-organised its orthopaedic services in moving trauma services to Drogheda and creating additional capacity for elective services in Navan. A new orthopaedic service will be provided at Mayo General Hospital. This new service will serve the people of the western region and increase orthopaedic capacity for the region. Building and equipping the new facility has been completed.</P>
        <P>As the single most limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability, increasing the bed capacity of the acute hospital system is of particular priority for my Department. The extent of the shortfall in acute capacity has been identified by the report, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review, as a requirement of an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospital by 2001. The first phase of this process commenced in January 2002 when capital and revenue funding was provided for an additional 709 beds. This represents an increase of 6% on existing capacity. Some 568 of these beds have been commissioned to date.</P>

	<P>The best health for children programme provides for a new core surveillance programme for all children in the 0-12 age group and covers both pre-school developmental examinations as well as the school health service. Underpinning the recommendations in the report is a model which embraces a more holistic child health promotion approach and emphasises the role of parents in achieving best health for their children. Additional funding in excess of &euro;2 million was allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 and 2002 to <Col N="648"/>facilitate the implementation of the recommendations set out in the best health for children report. This funding has been used to appoint key individuals at regional level to drive the implementation process at board level as well as to establish pilot projects aimed at demonstrating best practice.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in the best health for children report is the need to provide appropriate training for public health doctors and public health nurses involved in delivering the child health surveillance programme, including the school health service. Additional funding of &euro;700,000, allocated to health boards and the ERHA in 2003 for this purpose, has been used to appoint relevant training personnel and to develop, in conjunction with TCD, a training programme for those involved in the delivery of the core surveillance programme. The training programme was launched on 13 January 2004. It is intended that all those involved in child health surveillance will have received the necessary training by the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, with a view to facilitating a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the delivery of a range of child health and child care projects, the health boards executive has established a programme of action for children and appointed an interim steering group to oversee its work. This new initiative will encompass a number of child related measures, including projects associated with best health for children.</P>

	<P>The need to develop community based health and personal social services so as to better meet the needs of local communities and ensure that services are provided in the most appropriate settings is a matter which is being addressed in the context of the implementation of the primary care strategy. The strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction, recognises that primary care is the first point of contact for the majority of people who use health services. Furthermore, with appropriate development and enhancement of capacity, primary care can meet 90%-95% of all health and personal social service needs.</P>
        <P>Primary care, planned and organised on the basis of delivery of a comprehensive range of services by interdisciplinary teams, will lessen the current reliance on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services. Based on available evidence, it will have the potential to <Col N="649"/>reduce the requirement for specialist services, reduce hospitalisation rates, reduce lengths of stay for those who are hospitalised, promote more rational prescribing and improve efficiency.</P>
        <P>The provision of a wide range of services in this way will allow a higher percentage of patients to be cared for in the community, thus reducing hospital admissions. Furthermore, as the strategy is implemented on a national basis, many services will be provided on an extended hours basis and out-of-hours cover for defined services will be greatly enhanced. The strategy also recognises the need to provide improved and expanded facilities from which primary care teams can deliver services in an integrated way.</P>
        <P>Primary care reform is central to the overall process of health service reform, which is progressing with a view to the development of structures which best facilitate the implementation of the interdisciplinary model of primary care as an integral part of a whole system approach to service delivery. As part of the reform plans, therefore, the system for the planning and delivery of primary care services, at national, regional and local level, will be reorganised in order to facilitate implementation of the model described in the primary care strategy.</P>

	<P>The report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland was published in October 2003. Its recommendations have been accepted by Government. The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of the future service expansion. The Government has also agreed that in the further development of services, consideration should be given to the efficacy of developing satellite centres in the south-east, mid-west and north-west.</P>
        <P>I will be meeting the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust this evening to discuss its proposal for radiation oncology services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick. The implementation of the recommendations of the expert report will result in significant <Col N="650"/>improvements as regards access by patients from the Mid-Western Health Board to radiation oncology services. Specifically, the immediate developments in Cork and Galway will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. Provision is also being made for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. We currently have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally.</P>

	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the North Eastern Health Board area and on a national basis.</P>
        <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards, including three from the NEHB, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an <Col N="652"/>approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The NEHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.559 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.114 million was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
        <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The NEHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.421 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
        <P>The waiting times and figures for orthodontic treatment by county is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, the chief executive officer of the NEHB has been requested to provide the information requested directly to the Deputy. The chief executive officer of the NEHB has informed my Department that at the end of the September 2003 quarter, the average waiting time for category A and category B orthodontic treatment was 1.7 months and 15 months, respectively. There were 266 patients awaiting treatment and there were no patients awaiting assessment for orthodontic treatment. The chief executive officer of the NEHB also informed my Department that at the end of the September 2003 quarter, there were 2,675 patients getting orthodontic treatment from the board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I met the Survivors of Symphysiotomy group in October 2003. Arising from this meeting, it was agreed that a range of measures put forward by the Eastern Regional <Col N="653"/>Health Authority and the health boards and designed to support the group would be put in place. The present position with regard to the implementation of these measures is as follows. Each health board-ERHA has appointed a liaison officer within the organisation to liaise with patients who have undergone symphysiotomy. The ERHA and the health boards have initiated steps to ascertain the number of symphysiotomies carried out in hospitals in their region. It may take some time to complete this process as procedures may have been carried out in maternity units or in hospitals that no longer exist.</P>
        <P>An exercise is underway to profile patients to assist in formulating a needs assessment for each individual. The SOS group has agreed to contact its members in this regard. Arrangements are being finalised with regard to the provision of independent counselling services. An information leaflet has been prepared in consultation with SOS and this leaflet will issue to general practitioners and patients shortly. Arrangements are being made to provide independent clinical advice to patients who have undergone symphysiotomy. This has already been availed of by a number of members of SOS. Discussions have taken place with SOS regarding the setting up of an information line which will be staffed by appropriate health care personnel.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is in discussion with the ERHA-health boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to a range of eligibility issues in respect of the provision of services and assistance to the patients. The ERHA and the health boards will continue to liaise with the group on the implementation of the above measures.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of accident and emergency services at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested.</P>
        <P>The report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, the Hanly report, envisages St. Columcille's Hospital being developed as a local hospital. The report recommends investment in local hospitals such as St. Columcille's so that they are in a position to provide most of the local population's needs for hospital care. Improvements proposed include: a greatly expanded proportion of elective day surgery and elective medical procedures for the region in a range of specialties. This will involve: an increasing volume of elective procedures that are often currently performed in the larger hospitals; a strong focus for locally accessible multi-specialist day and out-patient, OPD, care; pre and post-natal maternity services; a point of access for general practitioners to services and diagnostic facilities; and rehabilitation and long-stay care.</P>
        <P>I will shortly be announcing an implementation group for the East Coast Area Health Board which will be tasked with planning and overseeing the detailed implementation of the recommendations of the report regarding provision of acute hospital services in that area. It should be noted that the implementation of the report in the East Coast Area Health Board will ultimately involve the appointment of an additional 129 consultants to the region.</P>

        <P>Penalty point systems are now operating in this country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The authorities in all three jurisdictions are actively considering the issue of the introduction of a scheme to provide for the mutual recognition of penalty points between the United Kingdom and Ireland. This consideration is being pursued under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. One of the first matters that will need to be addressed before full mutual recognition can be realised will be the introduction of bilateral recognition of the separate penalty points systems operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The summit meeting of the British-Irish Council which took place in Cardiff on 28 November 2003 focused on the subject of indigenous, minority and lesser used languages. In addition, the council was updated on work being undertaken in other areas of the British-Irish Council work programme, including transport. The transport work programme, on which the Northern Ireland administration takes the lead, includes a proposal for developing mutual recognition of driving offences between British-Irish Council member administrations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 recommended that a system of penalty points should be introduced with the specific focus of tracking a range of motoring offences that have a direct impact on road safety. The Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the penalty points system, reflects that focus, and the 69 offences identified as penalty point offences are directly related to road safety. The only offence relating to parking included in the list is the offence of dangerous parking as such activity has a direct influence on road safety. While I have no plans to extend the penalty points system to other offences at this time, I will keep the system under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 809, 815, 817 and 826 together.</P>
        <P>There has been a number of consultancy or expert reports in recent years on Aer Rianta and the State airports, including the Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999 which reviewed the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta, the Doganis report of January 2002 on aviation-tourism issues and the Mullarkey report of February 2003 on the independent terminal concept for Dublin Airport. In addition, in May of last year, Aer Rianta submitted to me a copy of a report, which the company commissioned from NERA Economic Consulting on competition in the context of Irish airports.</P>
        <P>The Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999, while offering some general observations on the issue of separating the three State airports, did not analyse this issue, draw any conclusions nor make any recommendations in respect of it. The decision by the Government in July last to restructure the State airports was a strategic decision taken on foot of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to continue to transform Aer Rianta and, as part of that process, to ensure that Shannon and Cork Airports have greater autonomy and independence.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements are designed to strengthen the contribution that the State airports make to economic development and to give both Shannon and Cork a fresh start under international and regional leadership. I believe all three airports can perform better than they have to date and, through more focused commercial operation, each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. I will shortly be announcing the remaining members of the boards-designate for Dublin and Cork Airports. As in the case of the Shannon board which I announced in October, the new boards for Dublin and Cork will bring together people of the highest calibre combining international, national and regional expertise.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the two new independent airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will both commence business free of debt and that the debts associated with these airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme currently under way at Cork Airport, will remain with Dublin Airport. The desirability <Col N="661"/>of these debt arrangements emerged from my Department's consideration of the financial position of the three State airports within the current Aer Rianta structure, which was provided to my Department by Aer Rianta. My Department was assisted in its analysis of the Aer Rianta data by PricewaterhouseCoopers which completed its work in the early part of last year.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing work on the implementation of the Government decision which is led by a project steering group in my Department on which Aer Rianta is represented, broad financial projections for the three airports will be updated over the coming weeks. These projections will be particularly important in establishing the opening balance sheets for the new airport authorities. This will not in any way inhibit the commercial freedom and indeed responsibility of the new airport authorities, when formally appointed, to develop strategic and business plans, including marketing strategies, for the three airports.</P>
        <P>As the current talks on an open aviation area agreement progress, it is apparent that changes in the relationship between the EU and US, in the context of transatlantic air services, are inevitable. Such changes will have consequences for the Ireland-US bilateral air services agreement. I am carefully monitoring the position and the compilation of the financial projections for the three airports will have regard to the emerging situation.</P>
        <P>In correspondence with ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions over the past fortnight, I have conveyed repeated assurances and clarifications in regard to the protection of the tenure and terms and conditions of employment of Aer Rianta workers in the context of the three new independent airport authorities when established. I have also reaffirmed my willingness to underpin this undertaking by including a provision in the amending legislation currently being drafted which will ensure that the existing workers in the company will not be brought to lesser terms and conditions of employment than they currently <Col N="662"/>enjoy. I am pleased that SIPTU decided to call off its threatened industrial action at the airports on Thursday last and I look forward to a resumption of the discussions between the unions and my Department, under the chairmanship of an LRC official, at which these and other issues of concern to the Aer Rianta unions can be further debated. However, contrary to some media reports in recent weeks, I have no proposals to issue letters of comfort to workers in Aer Rianta and such letters are neither appropriate nor necessary in this case. My position on this has been misrepresented as &ldquo;jobs for life&rdquo;, a term I have not used nor do I believe it is a term any trade union has used either. It is normal when State companies are in transition to provide for the same terms and conditions for existing workers afterwards as before. Therefore, the phrase is misleading and does not apply here.</P>
        <P>I have stated in recent correspondence with trade union representatives that the appropriate way to reflect my commitment to maintain the security and quality of employment of Aer Rianta workers post restructuring remains to be finalised between my Department and the trade unions. I have suggested that the talks being chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission provide the appropriate forum for this.</P>
        <P>Issues relating to any former agreements between Aer Rianta and the ITGWU &mdash; now known as SIPTU &mdash; are a matter for the parties concerned in accordance with the terms of those agreements.</P>

	<P>The Department of Transport's objective is to ensure a focused and pragmatic Presidency which delivers realistic goals. Last week I presented Ireland's Presidency programme for the transport sector to the regional policy, transport and tourism committee of the European Parliament in Brussels. The full text of that address is available on my Department's website at <i>www.transport.ie</i>. In addition, I have held meetings with delegations of different member <Col N="668"/>states, trade associations and other representative bodies in pursuance of that programme.</P>
        <P>Over the next few months the Department will chair approximately 22 working group meetings dealing with transport issues, leading up to two Transport Councils on 8 March 2004 in Brussels and 10 June 2004 in Luxembourg. The immediate focus of our work is on progressing the trans-European networks, TENS, guidelines on transport to meet the needs of the enlarged Europe, and completing the second rail package of rail freight liberalisation measures.</P>

Information regarding the number and grade of staff decentralising and their associated accommodation needs has been furnished to the Department of Finance implementation committee.

	<P>Arrangements for the recruitment of driver testers are principally the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission. As part of the recruitment process, candidates for the position of driver testers are obliged to undertake a psychometric test which assesses their suitability for the position. Candidates are also interviewed and undergo a test of their driving ability.</P>
        <P>The driving test in Ireland is designed in accordance with the requirements of the European Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licenses, which sets out the skills that a driver must demonstrate during a driving test.</P>
        <P>Following recruitment each driver tester undergoes a six week training course which covers all aspects of the driving test. The work of driver testers is monitored on an ongoing basis by supervisory driver testers to ensure that a uniform standard of test is maintained. There are procedures in place to ensure that further training is provided if difficulties in applying this standard are identified.</P>
        <P>All driver testers underwent a comprehensive two week refresher training programme in 2002 which covered procedures for carrying out driving tests, guidelines for assessing driving faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test.</P>

	<P>To date, staff members in my Department have not been surveyed to ascertain the number wishing to move to a location scheduled for decentralisation. <Col N="675"/>I have established a decentralisation implementation group in my Department to manage the decentralisation process. It is chaired by an assistant secretary and includes representatives from the areas and agencies scheduled for decentralisation. The question of conducting a survey of the nature referred to above is among the issues being considered by that group.</P>

	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that it has examined the case for reopening Dunleer Station on a number of occasions in the past. A review of the Dublin suburban rail strategy, conducted on behalf of the company, concluded that the station would have only very modest daily boardings given the population of the area. I understand that, since the review was conducted, a new development plan has been approved for Dunleer which involves significant population growth. While I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not yet seen the revised development plan, the company has indicated that it is prepared to re- examine its position regarding the reopening of the station if the plan is adopted and funding can be provided from developers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A grant application for capital grant assistance from the equal opportunities child care programme for 2000 to 2006 was received from that community-based group in December 2002. All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process by Area Development Management Limited. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme, and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities. My Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital grant assistance are appraised in accordance with the programme <Col N="677"/>criteria to ensure that those projects which best meet the aims and objectives of the programme receive the capital grant assistance which will enable them to provide quality child care in areas where there are service deficits. It would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for capital grant assistance at present.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the matters raised on the Adjournment on 12 and 19 November 2003 regarding measures to contain prison costs, including possible new management arrangements for Loughan House which would not involve the Irish Prison Service.</P><Col N="680"/>
        <P>On 11 November 2003, the Government decided to implement, from 1 January 2004, a number of measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association in ongoing talks on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing prison costs. Those measures include transformation of the open centre at Loughan House into a post-release centre for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. The precise arrangements for the running of such a facility are being finalised in my Department. As I have already indicated, serving staff will be transferred to other prisons to perform duties which must currently be done on overtime. <Col N="681"/>Similar arrangements will be implemented regarding the other open centre at Shelton Abbey, Arklow, County Wicklow.</P>
        <P>I have already made it clear on several occasions, both inside and outside this House, that I want the Prison Officers' Association to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the continued involvement of prison officers in operating our prisons and open centres. However, if consensus is not possible, I will have no option but to proceed with implementation of the measures decided by Government, including alternative arrangements for the operation of Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Private Security Services Bill 2001, which is currently awaiting Report Stage in the House, provides for the establishment of a body, to be known as the Private Security Authority, to control and supervise individuals and firms providing security services. The principal function of the authority will be to operate a licensing system for providers of security services to maintain and improve standards within the sector.</P>
        <P>Provisions relating to the grant of licences are set out in section 21 of the Bill. Applications for licences must be accompanied by such references as to the applicant's character and competence as the authority may require. Section 35 requires an applicant for a licence, or a licensee who has been convicted of an offence, other than a prescribed offence, or against whom proceedings for such an offence are pending, to notify the authority of the conviction or proceedings in a prescribed manner.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of assessing an application, the authority may require an applicant to furnish additional information and may require verification by affidavit of any information provided by the applicant. A certificate by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of superintendent may also be required. Section 33 of the Bill enables the authority to request the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide any information requisite for the due performance of its functions regarding any applicant for a licence or any licensee, and the Commissioner shall comply with any such request.</P>
        <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides that the authority shall refuse to grant a licence where, on the basis of the information provided to it, the applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service. In the case of companies and partnerships, the conditions apply to directors <Col N="682"/>and partners respectively as well as to any manager, secretary or other similar officer of the entity concerned. The authority shall also refuse to issue a licence where an applicant does not comply with a requirement under the Bill or regulations made by the authority, e.g. regarding training, where an applicant is under 18 years of age or where the applicant has not paid the prescribed fee. To ensure tax compliance by applicants and licensees, section 24 of the Bill provides that the authority shall refuse to grant or renew a licence to or regarding a person regarding whom a tax clearance certificate is not in force.</P>

	<P>There were a total of 307 prisoners granted varying periods of temporary release at Christmas under the Criminal Justice Act 1960. That is roughly 9% of the prisoner population. That figure corresponds almost exactly to the number released in the previous two years. The periods of release varied from a few hours, in some cases accompanied by another responsible person, up to nine nights. All releases were subject to stringent conditions, which in the vast majority of cases included a requirement to report on a regular basis to his or her local Garda station. As of today's date, ten of those persons had failed to return to custody. In each case the Prison Service has made contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform it. Each of those persons can be arrested immediately and returned to prison custody.</P>

However, in so far as the Deputy's question may arise in the context of <Col N="684"/>public comments which I have made relating to the funding of a particular party in this House, I can tell him on the basis of the briefings available to me that I stand by those comments, and that will remain my position until such time as it is clear that all criminal activity carried out by or to the benefit of a particular paramilitary organisation, with links to that party, has ceased completely.</P>

	<P>Measures designed to enforce compliance with our immigration laws are but one aspect of the regulatory arrangements which apply to non-nationals seeking to enter or to remain on our territory. While those measures, which are the focus of the Deputy's question, are by no means the only policy response required to deal with the immigration phenomenon, they are nonetheless an important element.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau's computerised information system is now available at 24 sites throughout the country on a 24-hour basis, including at all major ports and airports. The essence of that system is the provision of up-to-date information immediately to immigration personnel throughout the State to support informed, effective and speedy decision making. For example, it contains data, with photographs, on all persons who have been refused leave to land at any port in the State and information on all persons who are the subject of deportation orders. It also contains data on virtually all legally resident non-EEA nationals, which obviates difficulties which may arise for such persons on arrival at a busy port or airport.</P>
        <P>Over 9,000 persons were refused entry to the State and returned to their countries of departure in the years 2002 and 2003. In addition, in those years, over 1,000 persons were deported and a further 1,200 approximately who no longer had permission to reside in the State returned voluntarily with the assistance of the immigration authorities. Thus, through those efforts alone, over 11,000 illegal immigrants or potential illegal immigrants have been detected and removed in the past two years. It is important to recognise the deterrent effect that this rigorous regime has on persons who might wish to exploit our immigration procedures.</P>
        <P>Both my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau have established international liaison arrangements with immigration authorities in both the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and France, which are major transit points for illegal immigration into the State, with a particular focus on trafficking activity. Those arrangements include the placement of permanent liaison <Col N="685"/>officers in the Irish embassies in both London and Paris. On another related front, we will of course during our Presidency of the European Union continue to promote and participate in a range of initiatives in co-operation with our European partners to address the complex web of issues surrounding illegal immigration.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Immigration Act, which was enacted on 14 July 2003, constituted a major addition to our corpus of immigration law. It contains a range of amendments designed to strengthen the effectiveness of our immigration and asylum procedures. The Act makes provision for the introduction of carrier liability, which obliges carriers bringing non-nationals into Ireland to satisfy themselves that the passengers whom they take on board at the point of departure have the correct documentation to allow them to disembark here. That provision, which operates regarding traffic coming from outside the common travel area, is having a major deterrent effect on illegal migration.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there is clear evidence to show that our asylum determination system is being abused by criminal elements whose activities have clear implications for the security and authority of the State itself and the general economic welfare of citizens. Those activities also have implications for the preservation of the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum system as it operates in Ireland for those who are genuinely in fear of persecution. The Act of 2003 contained significant changes to the Refugee Act 1996 to reduce the extent of that abuse. Those include provisions requiring applicants to play a more active role in the asylum process. Failure to co-operate now results in rejection of applications. It also contains provisions for more accelerated processing of applications, including: prioritisation of certain claims; reduced time limits for appeals; greater use of appeals on papers alone; designating of States as safe countries of origin for the purpose of refugee determinations; and streamlined operation of the Dublin Convention and safe third countries processes. The total number of asylum applications for the year 2003 was 32% down on the number for 2002, the number for the last six months of 2003 being 52% down on the comparable period for the previous year.</P>
        <P>It is well recognised that increased efforts to combat illegal immigration are accompanied by greater attempted exploitation of legal migratory routes. That results in increased efforts to support visa applications with false documentation or information, greater use of falsified passports and work permits, etc. There is a very rigorous regime employed to determine visa applications, and personnel from my Department are now employed in the embassies in Moscow and Beijing. Fourteen thousand visa applications were rejected in 2002, while 105,000 were granted. In addition, immigration officers with the assistance of the Garda National Immigration Bureau's <Col N="686"/>computerised information system and other specialised equipment now have the capacity to check the authenticity of passports, visas, work permits and Garda registration cards.</P>
        <P>The foregoing is but a brief synopsis of all that has been achieved in recent years in response to the issue outlined by the Deputy. Other initiatives include the conclusion of re-admission agreements with a number of source countries, the enactment of legislation criminalising employers who employ non-EEA nationals without a work permit, the enactment of legislation restricting the payment of rent supplements to asylum seekers and other persons not lawfully in the State, the engagement of the International Organisation for Migration to encourage voluntary return, and of course the deployment of additional resources in both my own Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau to deal with the problem.</P>

	<P>The Irish Presidency programme was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 December and debated in the D&aacute;il on 20 January. The programme sets out in detail my priorities for the Justice and Home Affairs Council in the context of the objective of developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. Those priorities are consistent with the requirements of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the work programme agreed by the European Council in Tampere for that purpose. The programme also sets out our priorities in the area of equality, where the focus will be on promoting equality and combating discrimination.</P>
        <P>January has already been a very busy month for my Department. The informal Justice and Home Affairs Council, which I chaired, took place in Dublin Castle on 22 and 23 January. Issues dealt with at that meeting included the Council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status, the question of a common return policy, organised crime, the proposal for a Council framework decision on a European evidence warrant and, in the context of civil law co-operation, the possibility of an EU instrument to deal with small claims. In addition, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, presented his views on the development of a common EU asylum policy at my invitation.</P>
        <P>Both I and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has special responsibility for equality matters, have also appeared before the European Parliament. I appeared before the European <Col N="687"/>Parliament Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on 21 January to brief the committee on the Irish Presidency priorities in the Justice and Home Affairs area. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, briefed the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on our priorities in the area of equality on 19 January.</P>
        <P>I will chair four further meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform officials will be called upon to chair approximately 140 meetings at working group level in Brussels and Ireland. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will chair two meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council regarding the equality issues before those Council meetings. There will also be further engagements with the European Parliament. A number of conferences and seminars relating to the Justice and Home Affairs area will also be held in Ireland. The calendar of Council meetings which I and other Government colleagues will chair has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library, as has the calendar of high-level meetings which are being held in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My officials and I have also advanced the Presidency programme through a considerable number of bilateral contacts with Ministers and officials in member states and other countries, and with officials in the European institutions. I will continue to hold such meetings as necessary. This is a general outline of my Department's activities regarding Ireland's EU Presidency and my own plans for that Presidency. However, it is likely that many other commitments will arise between now and the end of the Presidency regarding my Department.</P>

	<P>Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make deportation orders regarding nine categories of persons. Between the commencement of that Act in November 1999 and 31 December 2003, 7,892 such deportation orders were served. A breakdown of that number into the nine categories is not available: the vast majority of the orders were made regarding failed asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>All deportation orders are served on the individuals concerned at their last given address with a requirement on them to present <Col N="688"/>themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, so that arrangements can be made for their removal from the State. Of the 7,892 persons who were notified of their deportation orders, 4608 failed to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau as required. Those persons are classified as evaders and, although it is not known how many actually remain in the State, they are subject to arrest and detention for the purposes of deportation.</P>

        <Quest>the reduction in the number of asylum seekers in 2003 and the reasons for this reduction in applications.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of asylum applications received in 2003 was 7,900 which represented a fall of some 32% compared to 2002 when 11,634 asylum applications were received. Excluding reapplications, the total number of applications for asylum received in 2003 was 7,483, a decrease of some 36% on 2002. While it is not possible to be absolutely certain in relation to all of the factors involved in the reduction in asylum numbers in 2003, it is possible to say that the fall in applications was influenced by a combination of factors and strategies.</P>
        <P>The Government now has in place a comprehensive strategy for dealing with asylum claims comprising, for example, a strengthened infrastructural and statutory framework for processing applications fairly and within shorter timescales to ensure that those in need of refugee protection receive that protection more speedily. The infrastructural framework, as the Deputy will be aware, is made up to two independent agencies, namely, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, which have been highly resourceful over recent years a situation that has resulted in the speedier processing of asylum applications by both offices. It is a well-known fact that slow decision/making in a refugee determination process often gives rise to high numbers of unfounded applications being received. Enhancing the processing capacity of our refugee determination process so as to speed up decision/making without compromising  fairness has certainly, in my opinion, had an important impact on numbers.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of processing and the shortening of timescales for decisions has been supported by the enhancement of our legislative base for dealing with asylum applications in the form, for example, of amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 by the Immigration Act 2003 which came into effect on 15 September 2003. These amendments were, <i>inter alia</i>, aimed at ensuring that asylum applicants participate more actively in the determination process and failure, for example, to co-operate with the asylum <Col N="689"/>process can result in the rejection of an application. The Immigration Act 2003 also contains provisions for the accelerated processing of asylum applications, including prioritisation of certain claims; strengthened credibility provisions; greater use of appeals on the papers alone; designation of States as safe countries of origin and streamlined operation of the Dublin Convention and safe third country processes. All of the relevant amendments in the  2003 Act were based on the experience of operating the Refugee Act 1996 over the past few years.</P>
        <P>Central to the integrity of any asylum process is the ability to return persons found not be in need of refugee protection, and who have no other protection needs, to their countries of origin. In this regard, we are continuing to maintain the number of deportations being effected, with some 590 persons deported in 2003 and some 762 voluntary returns also taking place during this period. As the Deputy will be aware, in the region of 90% of asylum applications received in the State are rejected on the basis that they do not meet the criteria for the award of refugee status as contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996 and in the 1951 Geneva Convention.</P>
        <P>I am also of the view that the Supreme Court judgment in January 2003 in the case of <i>Lobe and Osayande</i> has also had an impact on the number of unfounded asylum applications being received in the State. The Deputy will be aware that this case dealt with the residency status of parents of an Irish-born child.</P>
        <P>There is clear evidence to show that our asylum determination process is being abused by criminal elements whose activities have clear implications for the security and authority of the State itself and the general economic welfare of its citizens. These activities also have implications for the preservation of the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum system as it operates in Ireland for those that are genuinely in need of protection. For the purpose of dealing with illegal immigration, the Government has provided increased resources to the Garda National Immigration Bureau. The bureau itself has also strengthened its international liaison arrangements with immigration authorities in both the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland and France, which are major transit points for illegal immigration into the State, with a particular focus on trafficking activity.</P>
        <P>Amendments contained in the Immigration Act 2003 designed to strengthen our immigration procedures have also provided an enhanced legislative framework for the Garda to carry out more effective immigration controls. The 2003 Act makes provision for the introduction of carrier liability which obliges carriers bringing non-nationals into Ireland to satisfy themselves that the passengers whom they take on board at the point of departure have the correct documentation to allow them to disembark here. <Col N="690"/>The provision, which operates in respect of traffic coming from outside the common travel area, is having a major deterrent effect on illegal immigration.</P>
        <Miles com="cl" par="115" />
        <P>While the Government will continue to meet its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, I am sure that the Deputy will agree that with  over &euro;340 million spent on the asylum and related immigration process, including on the provision of support services to asylum seekers in 2002 &mdash; a final figure is not yet available for 2003 &mdash; it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that we have a fair and efficient asylum process in place which will tackle abusive applications as well as ensuring that those in genuine need of protection receive that protection as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the issue of asylum is complex and presents many challengers for all the agencies involved in the asylum and immigration process. However, I am convinced that the policies being pursued are the right ones, as evidenced in particular by the results I have highlighted in reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 853 and 856 together.</P>
        <P>My preference would be for Shelton Abbey to continue to be operated by the Irish Prison Service within a prison system that functions on a sensible, reasonable and cost-effective basis. Achieving such a system will require significant cost restructuring in all prisons and places of detention on foot of proposals put to the Prison Officers' Association for new staff attendance arrangements and the elimination of overtime working.</P>
        <P>The Government decision of 11 November last involves the progressive implementation, from 1 January 2004, of several measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association, or POA, on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Prison Service. Those measures include the making of arrangements for the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House, Blacklion, County <Col N="691"/>Cavan, and Shelton Abbey, Arklow, County Wicklow, into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. My Department and the Irish Prison Service are finalising the arrangements which need to be put in place to give effect to that aspect of the Government decision.</P>
        <P>The conversion of Shelton Abbey to a new post-release facility will result in significant savings, mainly arising from reductions in the pay bill. For the year ending 31 December 2002, the most recent year for which financial information is available, Shelton Abbey incurred &euro;600,000 in overtime payments to prison officers.</P>
        <P>Under the new proposed arrangement, that overtime will be eliminated. In addition, the current Prison Service complement of 41 staff will be replaced with fewer non-prison staff at significantly reduced rates of pay owing to the fact that the work to be carried out at the centre will be based on more comparable and realistic national work models. That will break the link to the types of security and staff resources required in a prison situation.</P>
        <P>As outlined previously, I have no desire to take away the running of Shelton Abbey from the Irish Prison Service. I want the POA to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the continued operation by its members of our prisons and the open centres. I met with representatives of the POA on 20 November last, and discussed my position on the negotiations. Agreement was subsequently reached with the Prison Officers' Association to employ the services of the Labour Relations Commission. Discussions are still ongoing, and I very much hope that a mutually acceptable way forward can be found at that forum.</P>
        <P>However, if a consensus is not possible, I will have no option but to proceed with the closure of Shelton Abbey place of detention, and to make arrangements for the alternative operation of the centre. The Prison Service will arrange for the transfer of prison officers from those locations to other prison institutions.</P>

	<P>Shelton Abbey is an open facility designed to accommodate up to 56 prisoners who are categorised as a low security risk. Currently 41 members of staff are serving at Shelton Abbey. Recently, the prisoner numbers have been reduced in preparation for implementation of the proposed transformation of the open centre at Shelton Abbey into a post-release centre for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. That measure is one of several steps which the Government approved in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish Prison Service. Any anomaly in staffing to prisoner ratios at Shelton Abbey in that context is purely temporary.</P>
        <P>Negotiations with the POA on moving that agenda forward are currently under way at the Labour Relations Commission, and it is my clear preference that a mutually advantageous agreement is reached with the Prison Officers' Association which would ensure an efficient and cost-effective Prison Service, including the open centre at Shelton Abbey.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Shelton Abbey place of detention incurred overtime costs of &euro;607,423 in 2002. Based on an average of 44 staff, that equates to average overtime earnings of &euro;13,805 per staff member. Shelton Abbey is an open centre and as such has a negligible security requirement when compared with the larger medium-security prisons such as Mountjoy and Wheatfield and the high-security prison at Portlaoise. However, it still generated more average overtime expenditure per staff member than that of the closed institutions of Fort Mitchel and Arbour Hill as well as the training unit, which is a semi-open place of detention.</P>

        <Quest>the number of serving prison officers now entitled to leave their positions and take retirement because they have served their contractual period of employment; and the contingency plans he has made should that become a reality against the background of a future industrial dispute.</Quest>

	<P>The maximum retirement age for a prison officer is 60 years, and the normal minimum retirement age is 55. However, at present a member of the service may also retire once he or she has completed 30 years' actual service in the Prison Service, provided he or she is at least 50 years of age. At the moment there are only 125 out of almost 3,200 officers who fall into any of those categories.</P>
        <P>Any vacancies arising as a result of staff retiring will be filled, having regard to Government policy on Civil Service numbers, by way of open competition conducted by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. A competition for the position of prison officer was last held in November 2001. The Government has approved the holding of a competition for the recruitment of a new entry-level grade of prison officer. The Irish Prison Service is carefully examining the detailed <Col N="694"/>arrangements which need to be put in place to give effect to that decision.</P>

The average processing time for applications for naturalisation is approximately 15 to 18 months at present. Consequently, the application of the person concerned will be finalised in early 2005.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In April 2001, the United Nations Human Rights Committee held that there had been a violation of the rights of the person in question under Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to equality before the law and to the equal protection of the law.</P>
        <P>The basis for that conclusion was that, in the view of the committee, the State had failed to demonstrate that the decision to refer the person in question to the Special Criminal Court, as provided for in the Offences against the State Acts, was based upon reasonable and objective grounds. In acknowledgement of the view of the committee and having regard to its obligations under Article 2, paragraph 3(a) of the covenant, the State made a payment to the person in question of IR1,000.</P>
        <P>The person in question submitted a communication to the Human Rights Committee in July 2001 complaining about the remedy provided by the State. In its decision adopted in October 2002, the committee decided that the communication was inadmissible under Articles 1 and 2 of the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Offences against the State Acts were the subject of a detailed review by a committee established under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman. The Committee's report was published in August 2002. It is an extensive report, dealing with complex issues of law and policy &mdash; including matters relating to the Special Criminal Court &mdash; and involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>Those recommendations in the report of immediate relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation. The Bill, accordingly, will give effect to a limited number of recommendations to that end. A fuller consideration of the other recommendations of the committee will be finalised once that Bill has been enacted, and I will then bring further proposals to the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which substitutes a new section for section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, generally prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from being in the bar of licensed premises. A licensee may, however, permit a child (a person under the age of 15 years) to be in the bar if accompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m. That discretion does not apply where it appears to the licensee that the child's presence in the bar could reasonably be regarded as injurious to the child's health, safety or welfare. A licensee may also permit a person aged between 15 and 17 to be in the bar unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m.</P>
        <P>A licensee may allow a child accompanied by a parent or guardian, or a person aged between 15 and 17, to be in the bar after 9 p.m. on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Bar&rdquo; is defined as any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and includes any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public. The restrictions already mentioned do not apply to other parts of the licensed premises. &ldquo;Substantial meal&rdquo; is defined in section 9(1) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 which provides that a meal served in any premises shall not be deemed to be a substantial meal unless the meal is such as might be expected to be served as a main midday or main evening meal or as a main course at either such meal, and the meal is of a kind for which (i) having regard to the prices charged for meals in the premises at times other than prohibited hours, or (ii) if meals are not normally served in the premises, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to charge a sum that is not less than that fixed by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 (section 9) Order 2003 (S.I. No. 442 of 2003) fixed this sum at &euro;9.00 with effect from 29 September 2003. The restrictions in section 14 of the 2003 Act do not apply to a son or daughter of the licensee, a person who resides in the licensed premises, a person who is passing through the bar solely for the purpose of entering or leaving another part of the premises, or a person who is employed in the licensed premises in accordance with section 38 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988.</P>
        <P>Where a part of licensed premises contains a bar counter which is physically closed and is not used for the supply of intoxicating liquor, such a part of the premises does not constitute a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; within the meaning of the 2003 Act. I would, however, recommend that any person organising <Col N="701"/>an alcohol-free event in such premises for persons under the age of 18 notify the superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the Garda district in which the premises are situated in advance of the proposed event.</P>
        <P>A restaurant in respect of which a special restaurant licence has been granted under Part II of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 is prohibited under section 16 of that Act from containing a bar. Section 14 of the 2003 Act does not, therefore, apply to a restaurant with a special restaurant licence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department's financial management system contains certain accounting information on the payment of lodging allowances in connection with the transfer of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, there are no records in my Department, either manual or computer, that can be readily accessed in order to indicate the number of members and their ranks, who have been granted the full 18 month lodging allowance from 1985 to date. An extensive trawl through manual records would be necessary but it is not certain that the result would be conclusive due to procedures in the accounts area for destroying accounting records after the record has been retained for seven years.</P>

	<P>The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were refused because the visa section of my Department could not ascertain the immigration status of the reference in Ireland. It is open to the applicants to appeal against the refusal of the visa applications by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department, enclosing additional supporting documentation.</P>

        <Quest>when a decision will be made on an application for residency status by a person (details supplied) in County Cork under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; and the reason for the delay in this decision.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned applied for residency on 26 November 2002 on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp; O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>Where such a person does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a Ministerial proposal to deport him or her. In that context the person will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, a decision is made not to make a deportation order the person will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Because of the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the case referred to by the Deputy will be examined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The person in question does not have current permission to reside in the State. She may return to Egypt but having done so will be in the same position as any other Egyptian national who wishes to enter the State. She will have to apply for a visa. The fact that a person has made an application to reside in the State does not confer on him or her a right to re enter <Col N="706"/>the State at any time until that application is determined.</P>

        <Quest>the position of an appeal made by a person (details supplied) against a decision to refuse their application for a visa for their daughter to visit Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The visa application in this case was refused due to insufficient supporting documentation. In particular, there was no evidence that the child's father had consented to the child travelling to Ireland to reside with her mother. In addition, the child's mother had not indicated her status in the State.</P>
        <P>An appeal against the refusal was received in November 2003. The visa appeals officer, having re-considered the application, upheld the original decision. In this regard, it was noted that the mother's permission to reside was due to expire in the coming weeks. It is, of course, open to the applicant to make a fresh application with up to date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Carbury Garda station, County Kildare as at 20 January 2004 was two (all ranks).</P>
        <P>In December 2002, I approved the proposed relocation of the Garda station at Carbury to Derrinturn, which is just two miles away. This process is ongoing. Derrinturn is the main residential area in the sub-district and in addition has the main centre of activities such as schools and shops in the area. I have been advised that local Garda management are satisfied that the current personnel strength of Carbury Garda station is adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next becomes available, the needs of the Carbury area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the DMR west division has four dedicated drug units which are supplemented by garda&iacute; from the divisional crime task force, the divisional traffic unit, detective units and regular units when carrying out operations in the division as required. I am further informed that specific operations and plans are put in place by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to target any drug dealing. The strength of the drug units is regularly reviewed and adjusted as required.</P>

	<P>Any allegations of serious wrongdoing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as those broadcast on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, are of course of serious concern to me. Some of these cases were previously reported and in the public domain, and either have been or may be dealt with in the courts or by the existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms, and I will not comment on the specific details of each case.</P>
        <P>I regard it as essential that there should be in place a mechanism for dealing with such cases which commands public confidence. In this regard I will shortly be publishing a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, the draft scheme of which was approved by Government and published in July 2003, one of the principal aims of which will be the establishment of such a mechanism which will address the acknowledged shortcomings of the existing law and procedures in this area.</P>

	<P>The person in question made a visa application in December 2003. The application was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular it was considered that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of his obligations to return home following his proposed visit. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 887 to 891, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>A key recommendation in the report to the United Nations on the national plan for women on the implementation of the Beijing platform for action was the development of a national women's strategy as the framework for Ireland's gender equality agenda for the coming years. Under Sustaining Progress, the Government has undertaken to develop a five-year national women's strategy.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the strategy will encompass policies and programmes across a number of Departments and will go beyond current Government commitments to develop new strategies for advancing women's issues and concerns. The strategy will encompass a broad range of issues affecting women and will draw on the Beijing platform for action, and the recommendations of the national plan for women 2002.</P><Col N="710"/>
        <P>My Department engaged in an intensive consultation process in the preparation of the national plan for women 2002. One of the results of this consultation process was the publication of the report, Aspirations of Women Collected in the Course of the Consultation Process on the National Plan for Women 2003: Towards a National Women's Strategy, which will be a key input into the development of the strategy.</P>
        <P>The scoping work for the development of the strategy is currently being finalised by my Department and I hope to present proposals to Government shortly. The scoping exercise is concerned with defining the process by which the strategy is developed and in broad terms, the framework of the strategy. Cross-cutting issues, such as indicators, will be discussed and agreed, as appropriate, during the development of the strategy. In preparation for the development of the strategy, my Department has commissioned a study on the currently available indicators in this area.</P>

	<P>I understand that this group recently withdrew their original application under the capital measure of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 as they are drawing up plans for a development on a new site.</P>
        <P>The day-to-day administration of the programme is carried out by Area Development Management Limited on my behalf and I understand that the group has been in contact with ADM in relation to its planned application for funding.</P>
        <P>The group may also contact Dublin city child care committee for advice and information on the development of their project. As the Deputy may be aware, city and county child care committees were established to develop and deliver a child care strategy to meet the child care needs of their respective areas.</P>
        <P>All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process by Area Development Management Limited. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant <Col N="712"/>assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital grant assistance are appraised in accordance with the programme criteria in order to ensure that those projects which best meet the aims and objectives of the programme receive the capital grant assistance which will enable them to provide quality child care in areas where there are service deficits.</P>

        <Quest>if he has received correspondence from the family of a person (details supplied) killed on 13 April 2002 following a fight in the car park of Naomh Mearnog's GAA Club, Portmarnock in relation to the dissatisfaction of the family with the legal proceedings; and the measures he proposes to take to address their concerns.</Quest>

	<P>I can confirm that correspondence has been received from the mother of the deceased person to whom the Deputy referred and that a reply has issued directly to her. The substantive issue raised in the correspondence relates to court proceedings arising from the tragic death of the person named. As the Deputy will be aware, the position is that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way in the conduct or decision in any individual court case.</P>

	<P>An application for naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 11 July 2003. An initial examination disclosed that the application was not fully completed and consequently it was returned to the applicant. A correctly completed application was received on 23 September 2003.</P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>The average processing time for applications for naturalisation is approximately 15 to 18 months at this point in time. Consequently, it is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised in the early part of 2005. As soon as I have reached a decision on the matter I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy of the outcome.</P>

In particular, he failed to disclose the details of the purpose or duration of his intended visit or show any evidence of how he intended to maintain himself during his proposed visit. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa application by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department, together with additional supporting documentation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 900 and 914 together.</P>
        <P>The areas under my Department's aegis that were selected in the Government's decentralisation programme announced on 3 December 2003 are as follows: Data Protection Commissioner's Office; the Equality Authority; Office of the Director of Equality Investigations (The Equality Tribunal); staff from the Garda Headquarters area; Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board; Land Registry; the Irish Prison Service; Probation and Welfare Service; and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform staff.</P>
        <P>While large scale decentralisation of this nature undoubtedly presents challenges, I am confident that it will not impact adversely on service delivery or efficiency in the offices being decentralised. A high-level implementation group has been established in my Department, with representatives from the areas concerned, to deal <Col N="717"/>with all issues arising from the decentralisation proposals approved by Government. The group will have regard to any decision of the central implementation committee that has been established by the Department of Finance. The Department has no plans to conduct a survey of staff.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is the 17 year old daughter of a non-national who has residency based on his parentage of an Irish born child. It appears she arrived in the State on 31 December 2002, having left her country of origin where she was residing with her mother and brothers. An application for permission to remain in the State was made on her behalf on 6 February 2003. The processing of applications for residency based on an Irish born child was suspended pending a determination by Government on the general policy to be adopted in light of the Supreme Court decision of 23rd January 2003. Consideration of such applications recommenced on 18th July 2003 following the announcement of that policy. The application in question is now being processed and further documentation is being requested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the pre-tender process for the CCTV system in Clondalkin is at an advanced stage. Request for tender and detailed technical specification documents are currently being drafted by the telecommunications section at Garda headquarters, having regard to experience gained during the installation of other Garda CCTV systems and technological developments in this field.</P>
        <P>It is intended that this system will go out to tender during the first quarter of 2004. Installation of CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process and consequently there are a number of stages in the planning of new Garda CCTV systems. It can be expected that the installation of cameras will commence following the tender process, evaluation and award of contracts, wayleave and planning processes, which in total will amount to not less than five months. The general timetable associated with the installation of a Garda CCTV system is set out below: EU tender process: 52 days minimum; evaluation and award of contract: 30 days minimum; planning process: 42 days minimum; administration: 30 days minimum.</P>
        <P>The scheme will consist of 11 CCTV cameras to be sited at the following locations in Clondalkin; junction of Tower Road/Convent Road/Main St.; Tower Road; Junction of Tower Road/Ninth Lock Road/Nangor Road; Junction of Watery Lane/Orchard Road; Monastery Road at Shopping Centre; Junction of Main Street/New Road; Monastery Road/Public Library; Junction of Newlands Road/New Road at Newlands Retail Centre; Green Park; Junction of Newlands Road/Naas Road/Belgard Road; Junction of Ninth Lock Road/Nangor Road.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for refugee status on 2 October 2000. He was refused asylum on 20 March 2002. He applied for residency on 9 August 2002 on the basis of parentage of an Irish child born in January 2002.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of <i>L &amp; O</i>, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage <Col N="719"/>of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport him. In that context, he will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, a decision is made not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Because of the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.</P>

	<P>In employment equality cases, other than those involving dismissal, a complainant must refer a complaint to the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations (ODEI &mdash; the equality tribunal) within six months of the alleged incident or within six months of the most recent of a series of such incidents. An extension of this period to twelve months may be granted where exceptional circumstances prevented referral within the normal period.</P>
        <P>In equal status cases, the complainant must notify the respondent (discriminating party) of his or her intention to refer a complaint to the ODEI, within two months of the alleged act of discrimination for the complaint to be valid. If the complainant can show that there was an exceptional reason for failing to notify the respondent on time, the timeframe may be extended to four months. The claim for redress must then be lodged with the ODEI within a period of six months of the occurrence of the prohibited conduct, however, this period may be extended to twelve months in exceptional circumstances.</P>

Naas Garda station is open to the public on a 24-hour basis. The Maynooth and Celbridge area is patrolled on a 24-hour basis by a patrol car. This is increased to two patrol cars at weekends. Leixlip Garda station forms part of Lucan district in the Dublin metropolitan region, western division. Lucan Garda station is open to the public on a 24-hour basis. The Leixlip area is patrolled by a patrol car on a 24-hour basis.</P>
        <P>I have been further advised that local Garda management are satisfied that the arrangements currently in place at Maynooth, Leixlip and <Col N="722"/>Celbridge are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. There are currently no plans to establish a district headquarters for the area of Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge.</P>

        <P>In October, 2001 the Government approved the report on civilianisation in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which recommended a programme of civilianisation to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. In this context, my Department is currently reviewing these figures in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Garda management. The civilianisation report also provides for the transfer of finance functions from the Garda district clerks to civilians, and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer. A competition is currently under way to fill these posts.</P>

Each case has always been considered on its individual merits having regard to the great variety of circumstances that arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 919 and 999 together.</P>
        <P>In August 2003 I announced a review of the retail planning guidelines in relation to the floor <Col N="732"/>space cap on retail warehouses contained in the guidelines. The guidelines currently prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large-scale single retail warehouse development. This cap is now being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats, while also having regard to issues of proper planning and sustainable development. Central to this review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have the range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.</P>
        <P>To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. Some 71 submissions were received by my Department and are now being assessed. They will be fully taken into account in considering further whether any changes are needed in the guidelines. I intend that the process will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 920, 996 and 1003 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is co-operating actively with the implementation committee and the Department of Finance in relation to the decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004. This envisages the decentralisation of all Dublin based functions of my Department, with the exception of Met &Eacute;ireann and some local <Col N="733"/>based services, to Wexford, which will serve as headquarters, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny. Some 660 Dublin based staff are currently involved in discharging these functions. My Department considers that a survey of its staff, and that of other Departments, to determine interest in transferring to these south eastern locations will most valuably be undertaken when greater clarification on detailed arrangements is available following, <i>inter alia,</i> the report of the Implementation Committee.</P>
        <P>My Department has set up an internal implementation team for decentralisation which will report regularly to me and my Department's management advisory committee. I intend that there will be full and timely communication with staff of the Department on the progress of the decentralisation programme, through the Department's partnership committee and otherwise. My Department is also committed to developing innovative approaches to information management, communications and logistics so as to maintain and improve the quality of service to be delivered under decentralised arrangements and to minimise disruption.</P>

	<P>The phasing-out of phosphate-based detergents has been progressed principally in the context of a voluntary agreement made in 1999 between my predecessor and the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association, ICDA, which represents some 90% of the domestic laundry detergents market in Ireland, and by ongoing liaison between my Department and the non-ICDA sector. The agreement provided that, by end-2002, 95% of all domestic laundry detergents marketed in Ireland should be zero-phosphate. While final audited figures for 2002 are awaited from ICDA, it is understood that this target has been substantially achieved provisional figures show a market share of between 93% and 94% for phosphate free products. My Department will continue to pursue the implementation of this target and the ultimate replacement of all phosphate based detergents by environmentally friendly alternatives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 922 and 923 together.</P>
        <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, is currently being implemented by all planning authorities and I understand that many authorities are actively engaged with developers in Part V pre-planning discussions-negotiations. There is a considerable lead-in time to the completion of houses under Part V. The latest figures available, published in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin &mdash; September Quarter 2003, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, indicate that 82 houses have been acquired under Part V, a further 449 are in progress and 1,895 are proposed. This is a substantial increase in activity over 2002 and I expect this to continue with a further significant increase in output during the current year.</P>
        <P>Mortgage finance for affordable housing provided under the Act, may be advanced by local authorities or the lending institutions. My Department is engaged in discussions with the representatives of the Irish Mortgage Council and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority regarding the provision of finance by the lending institutions for affordable housing, for purpose of Part V and other initiatives. Affordable housing provided under Part V or other initiatives provides a home at considerable discount on the market price for the eligible purchaser. Therefore, to ensure that the schemes benefit, as intended, genuine first time buyers, each scheme embodies a mechanism to prevent inappropriate profits arising for the sellers of an affordable home. While my Department is not seeking to have this reflected as a first charge on the affordable house, we wish to see it having appropriate ranking to reflect the State's interest. My Department attaches a high priority to resolving the outstanding issues with the lending institutions and is awaiting the response from the most recent consultations with the Irish Mortgage Council before deciding on the appropriate next steps.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 924 and 959 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other stakeholders with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative, PRI, to implement the European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. I have also had meetings with the three main stake-holder groups.</P>
        <P>Necessary enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the Directive have been incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Part VA of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 44 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, explicitly provides for producer responsibility for the free deposit of ELVs at authorised treatment facilities by their last owners; the appropriate treatment and recovery of ELVs deposited at authorised treatment facilities in line with the directive requirements, that is, depollution and removal of specified components and substances to facilitate increased reuse and recycling; the mandatory deposit of ELVs by their registered owners at authorised treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery, and the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of ELVs deposited at authorised treatment facilities for scrapping.</P>
        <P>Agreement in principle was reached in December 2001 that the relevant stakeholder groups would establish a not for profit company to operate an ELV recovery scheme to be subsidised by a fund generated by a levy on imported new and used vehicles.</P>
        <P>However, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the detailed mechanisms to apply the levy and introduce the scheme as originally envisaged. My Department is continuing to engage with the relevant stake-holder groups on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take-back arrangements required by <Col N="736"/>the directive, including how such arrangements will be funded. Such detailed mechanisms will be provided for in regulations.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has recently &mdash; November 2003 &mdash; initiated formal legal proceedings against Ireland and five other Member States in the European Court of Justice, ECJ, in relation to the implementation of the directive. In light of this action, it is my objective that the discussions with the stake-holder groups will be concluded as soon as possible. When these discussions are concluded I will announce details of the arrangements for the implementation of the directive. I am anxious to ensure that by the time the directive becomes fully operational in 2007 Ireland has a system in place for the recovery and recycling of ELVs capable of meeting the targets and standards set out in the Directive.</P>

	<P>As the European and local elections will be held on the same day next June, the local European returning officer will be responsible for holding the polls and the provision of polling stations. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities in making polling schemes, as a reserved function, shall endeavour to appoint as polling places only areas which will allow a returning officer to provide at each polling place at least one polling station accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
        <P>The local European returning officer is required, as far as possible, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users; and where this is not possible, to give public notice of all polling stations in buildings which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to the assigned polling station he or she may apply, in writing, for authorisation to vote at another station in an accessible building in the same constituency. A person with a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station may apply to vote by post.</P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 119 of 9 October 2003, my priorities for the Irish Presidency are focused around three key areas.</P>
        <P>First, advancement of the EU's internal environment policy and legislation agenda. The Environment Council has a wide-ranging policy and legislative agenda and I am giving priority to key proposals on air quality, waste management, climate change, chemicals and nature conservation. Negotiations on a number of proposals is ongoing or planned with a view to maximising progress at the Council of <Col N="738"/>Environment Ministers' meetings on 2 March and 28/29 June.</P>
        <P>The second is preparation of the environmental contribution to the annual review of the Lisbon Agenda by the European Council at its spring meeting. Informed by a number of inputs from the European Commission, such as the recently published annual environment policy review 2003 and spring report, I will emphasise the need to decouple economic growth and social progress from environmental degradation. In particular, I will be promoting innovation and investment in clean technologies with a view to boosting competitiveness and growth, increasing employment and strengthening environmental protection. Finalisation of the environmental contribution to the annual review of the Lisbon Agenda will be a priority for the Environment Council meeting on 2 March.</P>
        <P>The third is effective participation by the EU in wilder international fora. I intend to maintain the EU's leadership in promoting sustainable development at international level, including through pursuit of the Plan of Implementation arising from the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. My main priority is to lead EU participation in a number of significant international meetings in the first half of 2004, including the seventh conference of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, incorporating the first meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, to be held in Malaysia in February and the 12th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development to be held in the United States in April 2004.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, my Department is organising or involved in a number of conferences and seminars which will be held in Ireland during the Presidency. An informal meeting of the Environment Council will be held in Waterford on 14 to 16 May 2004, and focus on Communications from the European Commission on the sustainable use of natural resources, and the recovery and recycling of waste. The discussions will inform further consideration of these issues by the Council at its June meeting.</P>

In this regard, annex II of the directive explicitly provides that packaging shall be designed, produced and placed on the market in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling. The essential requirements are transposed into national law under the combined provisions of article 24 of, and the Third Schedule to the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003. In effect, there is already a general obligation on producers to use easily removable labels on bottles, jars and other containers to facilitate the recycling of the relevant packaging materials after use. It is not proposed to make further regulations in this regard.</P>

        <P>Following an open tender competition which fully complied with EU's public procurement procedures, my Department in June 2001, appointed the consortium, Nedap BV, Bureau Groenendaal BV and Powervote, to provide the voting machines and supporting software for the holding of elections in this country. The consortium has extensive experience in providing equipment for elections in two other EU member states and in the development and maintenance of election software. The equipment and software for the voting machines has been tested by two international institutes for compliance with internationally accepted standards.</P>
        <P>As regards the conduct of elections in this country, returning officers appointed under the various electoral legislative codes are responsible for conducting elections. Advice and support, as required, will be made available by my Department to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. However, at all times, the returning officer is the person statutorily responsible for conducting the election. Detailed security protocols and procedures will be in place to ensure that access to the voting machines and stand-alone dedicated election computers is restricted and controlled by the returning officer responsible for the election or to authorised staff under the supervision of the returning officer.</P><Col N="742"/>

        <P>The total non-national road grant allocation, announced yesterday, for Mayo County Council in 2004 is &euro;20,945,500, representing an increase of 13% over the 2003 allocation.

	<P>Council Directive 2003/122/EURATOM of 22 December 2003 on the control of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources came into force on 31 December 2003.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the directive is to prevent exposure of workers and the public to ionising radiation arising from inadequate control of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources, and to harmonise controls in place in member states by defining specific requirements ensuring that each such source is kept under control.</P>
        <P>The directive obliges member states, before issuing any authorisation for any practice involving a source to ensure that adequate arrangements have been made for the safe management of the source, including when <Col N="745"/>disused. These arrangements may provide for the transfer of such sources to the supplier, or their placement in a recognised installation, or an obligation for the manufacturer or the supplier to receive the sources.</P>
        <P>Where there are no arrangements for the return of disused sources to the supplier or manufacturer, the directive effectively places an onus on states to have a secure radioactive waste storage facility by 31 December 2005.</P>
        <P>Ireland's radioactive waste is mainly low level and low volume and arises from hospital, educational and industrial applications. All users of radioactive materials in Ireland do so under licence from the RPII. Radioactive waste is currently stored in hospitals, third level educational establishments and on industrial premises also under licence from the RPII. While the RPII does not consider that radioactive waste is stored unsafely at present, storage in diverse locations is not an acceptable long-term solution and is inconsistent with the Directive in the case of high activity and orphan sources. The RPII inspects storage premises regularly to ensure that licence conditions are being upheld. Both the RPII and my Department have been exploring possible locations for a storage facility, and a suitable location has yet to be identified.</P>

        <P>In relation to recent incidents of unauthorised encampments in the Killinarden area of Tallaght, I understand that the Traveller families concerned, who in some cases had left accommodation in the south Dublin area, have now been moved on and that most of the families have again been provided with accommodation.</P>
        <P>I understand that a number of sections of South Dublin County Council were involved in dealing with the issues that arose in relation to these encampments which included litter, waste, stray dogs, traffic matters and the illegal use of electricity from the public lighting supply.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have a range of powers available to them specifically to deal with unauthorised temporary encampments. These include powers under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 and the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas. In addition, local authorities have powers to address issues resulting from such encampments such as controls under environmental, litter and waste management legislation.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for South Dublin County Council to ensure that the area affected by the unauthorised encampment is restored to an acceptable condition. There is no specific provision in my Department's Vote for the assistance of local authorities in carrying out works arising from unauthorised temporary encampments.</P>

	<P>The counting of votes at the local elections will take place after polling stations close on Friday 11 June 2004. As there are a number of polls, the ballot modules with the vote data will be first loaded into the computer system by the local European returning officer for the taking of the poll at city and county level. The vote data for each poll will then be distributed in a secure manner to the returning officers for the local elections and to the European constituency officers for the purposes of vote counting.</P>
        <P>The counting of votes at the local elections will commence on receipt of the vote data, probably around 12 midnight, and counting will continue throughout Saturday morning until the results are available. The time for completion of the local election counts will vary between areas.</P>
        <P>EU legal requirements prohibit the official announcement of results in a member state until voting has concluded in all member states. In order to respect this requirement, the counting of the European Parliament votes will be carried out on Sunday 13 June at 9 p.m. The results should be available between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 954 and 955 together.</P>
        <P>My Department represents Ireland at EU level on various civil protection &mdash; emergency planning &mdash; working groups and committees in relation to improving co-operation strategies between member states in the event of major emergencies, or the imminent threat thereof, which may require urgent response action outside the capabilities of the affected country.</P>
        <P>One of the main developments in this area in recent years was the adoption on the 23 October 2001 of a Council decision, 2001/792/EC, establishing a Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced co-operation in civil protection assistance interventions. The mechanism provides for interventions inside and outside the European Union and is intended to help ensure better protection primarily of people but also of the environment and property. It improves intervention responses through means of better co-ordination facilities and strengthening of communications and training capacities. Participation in the mechanism is open to all EU member states, accession countries and the European Economic Area countries. An EU civil protection agency was not established under the Council decision. The European Commission DG Environment and Civil Protection is charged with <Col N="749"/>implementing the mechanism and co-ordinating its activities on behalf of the Community.</P>
        <P>Among other things, the mechanism provided for the setting up of an improved EU civil protection monitoring and information centre, MIC, accessible and able to react immediately 24 hours a day; and a procedure for the provision of up to date information on the resources available in countries participating in the mechanism for different types of interventions.</P>
        <P>Following an initial trawl of the relevant Departments, agencies and bodies, including all local authorities, my Department on 25 February 2003 informed the EU that Ireland could make available, within the framework of the mechanism, 15 experts and six intervention teams &mdash; 42 personnel. A handbook for the conduct of operations by all teams and experts, prepared by the Commission civil protection unit, has recently been circulated to all Irish teams and experts. A number of Irish team leaders and experts will participate in mechanism training courses commencing shortly.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the declaration of resources/experts/teams that could be available within the framework of the mechanism, participation, when requested, is voluntary. It is a matter for the national authorities in the first instance and the organisation/body or individual involved. Ireland can also call on the resources and expertise of the EU mechanism in the event of a national emergency situation requiring international assistance.</P>
        <P>In the case of the recent earthquake in Bam, Iran, the European Commission, through the MIC, first contacted Iranian authorities on 26 December 2003 to offer assistance following media reports of the disaster. The MIC subsequently notified the formal request for assistance to all participating countries, including Ireland, through the designated 24 hour contact points.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the request and having regard to the resources available for dispatch under the mechanism, it was confirmed to the MIC that Ireland was not in a position immediately to send search and rescue teams to Bam. However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed that a sum of &euro;1 million would be provided for humanitarian aid in the area. A large number of search and rescue teams from 12 of the 28 participating countries assisted the Iranian authorities in Bam and a &lsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; exercise is currently under way on the operation of the mechanism in Bam. My Department, as chair of the Council civil protection working party during the EU Presidency, will support co-ordination and continuous development of the civil protection capabilities of the European Union.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 956 to 958, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The projected lifespan of the electronic voting machines is 20 years and there will be little or no ongoing replacement or annual maintenance costs. The warranty on the voting machines expires at the end of 2007 and after this time a service agreement will be entered into with the suppliers. As regards the integrated election system, IES, the Department will continue with software testing up to the June polls. There will be no additional cost for software updates within this period. The question of software licensing and ongoing software support thereafter will be considered following the 2004 polls. Further significant changes in the software for future elections or referendums should not arise, other than those that may be required by changes in electoral legislation.</P>
        <P>Definitive cost comparisons of a national poll carried out under the manual system and the electronic system will not be available until after the first countrywide use of the new system in June of this year, however, significant savings in staff costs at counting stage are anticipated. Training of returning officers and election staff is ongoing and firm costs will not be available until later this year. Training requirements in the future will be determined by the frequency of polls and the availability of trained staff for such polls.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest official data on packaging waste arisings and recovery are contained in the national waste database report for 2001, published by the EPA in July 2003. The EPA estimates that 105,273 tonnes of glass packaging waste arose in the household and commercial waste streams in 2001, of which 41,156 tonnes, 39.1%, was recycled and the remainder, 64,118 tonnes, 60.9%, was landfilled. The vast majority of the glass collected for recycling in 2001 was recycled at the Irish Glass plant in Ringsend, which has since ceased operations.</P>
        <P>On foot of the continued expansion of the bring bank network under the local and regional waste management plans, and the commencement of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, which impose a mandatory obligation on commercial premises to segregate specified packaging waste materials, including glass, arising on their own premises for recycling, there has been a significant increase in the glass recycling rate in the interim. Based on data supplied by Repak, the voluntary compliance scheme established by Irish industry to meet Ireland's EU packaging waste recovery targets, an estimated 75,000 tonnes of glass was collected for recycling in 2003. It is further estimated that approximately 87% of this glass, approximately 65,000 tonnes &mdash; was transported to a facility in Northern Ireland for recycling. Of the estimated remaining 13% of this glass, it is estimated that approximately 9,000 tonnes was exported to glass recycling plants in England and Scotland and that approximately 1,000 tonnes was recycled as sub-base material in road construction projects in 2003. While there is no data available yet in relation to overall glass waste arisings in 2003 and allowing for some increase in glass waste arisings since 2001, it is reasonable to assume that the glass recycling rate is now in the region of 60%, with the remaining glass waste being landfilled. Thus, significant progress is being made in improving the rate of recycling for this waste stream.</P>

	<P>According to the information available to my Department, the person named was required under his commonage framework plan to reduce his stock by 13 ewes. Ten of these ewes were de-stocked <Col N="753"/>to bring the farmer down to the approved good farming practice level of five ewe equivalents per hectare. Under the polluter pays principle, no compensation is payable for de-stocking of sheep down to this level. Compensation is only available for reductions of stock below this level. In this case, reductions below this level involved a further three ewes, for which he received payment of &euro;60 per ewe.</P>

	<P>D&uacute;chas was the title and brand name of the organisational division of my Department which had responsibility for built and natural heritage functions. Following the change of Government <Col N="755"/>in mid-2002 my Department now has responsibility for policy in respect of the built heritage and for both policy and operational matters relating to the natural heritage. The operational and management functions in relation to the built heritage in State care have transferred to the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>These organisational arrangements are designed to achieve the optimum use of the organisational resources available to the Government. They build on my Department's strengths in terms of regulation and policy development, particularly in the environmental area, and on the expertise and experience of the Office of Public Works in the areas of conservation and management of the State's property portfolio.</P>
        <P>Under the new organisational arrangements, responsibility for built heritage issues has been integrated into a heritage and planning division. Responsibility for nature conservation and biodiversity protection has been assigned to an environmental infrastructure division, which also deals with waste and water policy and infrastructure. The earlier configuration of D&uacute;chas functions has therefore been substantially rearranged and the title of D&uacute;chas as been discontinued.</P>
        <P>My Department's objectives under this rearranged structure have been set out in its recently published revised statement of strategy 2003-2005, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 provide for my Department to make orders relating to the provision of open seasons for the hunting of protected fauna. These orders are reviewed annually by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department, taking account of the conservation needs of the individual species.</P>
        <P>Under section 29(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, my Department issues licences to hunt deer during the open season and some 2,050 such licences were issued for the 2002-2003 season. My Department also issues an annual licence to the Ward Union Hunt Club, under section 26(1)(ii) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as <Col N="756"/>amended), to hunt deer with a pack of stag hounds.</P>
        <P>The ordinary hunting of hares during the open season does not require a hunting licence. However, the hunting of hares with a pack of beagles requires a licence and, under section 26(2) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, my Department has granted licences on an annual basis to the Irish Masters of Beagles Association.</P>
        <P>Although the hunting of birds is covered in general by the orders providing for open seasons, individual licences are required under section 30 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, for hunting on foreshore, lakes and inland waters belonging to the State. There are currently some 3,000 such licences. While such licences are applicable to the hunting of fauna generally, they are in practice obtained for the hunting of wildfowl, and are subject to the provisions of the open season orders.</P>
        <P>These are the only licences that my Department issues for the hunting of wild animals. However, under separate provisions of the Wildlife Act, licences are also granted for the control of protected wild animals causing damage to crops or property, and for the capture of protected wild animals for specified purposes under specified conditions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 971 to 976, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In light, <i>inter alia</i>, of the submission made by the Heritage Council, as referred to in Question No. 973, the Attorney General's advice was sought by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands regarding the application of section 26 of the Wildlife Act 1976 to the hunting of deer by stags. This advice was furnished in February 1999 and confirmed the long-standing interpretation of the above section, i.e. that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of stag hounds a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack during such period or periods as is or are specified in the licence.</P>
        <P>Licence applications from the Ward Union Hunt Club continue to be determined on their merits in accordance with this legal advice. Public disclosure is not normally made of legal advice by the Attorney General to the Government. It is not therefore proposed to make the present advice available to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Conservation rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and a veterinary inspector from the Department of Agriculture and Food monitor the operations of the Ward Union Hunt Club. The veterinary inspector monitors the welfare of deer hunted by the club, on a spot check basis, at the request of and in an advisory capacity to my Department, by checking on the veterinary aspects of compliance with the hunting code of practice.</P>
        <P>Prior to the issue by my Department of the annual licence, written reports from conservation rangers and the veterinary inspector are examined to establish that the club has satisfactorily complied with the hunting code of practice, which was adopted in 1999 following extensive consultations with the relevant Departments, and that the hunt has been conducted in accordance with the conditions of the previous annual licence.</P>
        <P>An annual inspection of the deer at the park is carried out at the end of the hunting season to ensure that the deer are healthy and sound and that the hunt records are complete. The last inspection was at the end of the 2002-3 season and showed no grounds for concern.</P>

        <P>I have considered carefully the many reports and views expressed by various individuals regarding the electronic voting and counting system. In order to ensure the security and integrity of the system I have arranged for extensive testing undertaken by internationally accredited independent test institutes in addition to functional testing by officials of my Department and returning officers. I am satisfied that the new system is secure, that it counts the votes accurately and quickly and that the measures and protocols put in place in advance of the forthcoming European and local elections will safeguard the integrity of the system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 986 and 987 together.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may comment on a draft development contribution scheme during the consultation period, it is ultimately for the elected members of the planning authorities to determine the level of contribution for their own functional areas and the classes of development to which the contributions will apply, having regard to the actual cost of providing infrastructure in that area. Circular letter PD 4/2003 of 27 June 2003, which issued to each planning authority, advised that the basis for determining the contribution levels in the scheme should be justified and supported. That circular also recommended that, in accordance with accepted practice, development contributions should not be charged in respect of social housing units, including those which are provided in <Col N="761"/>accordance with an agreement made under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, or which are provided by a voluntary or co-operative housing body, whether or not under Part V.</P>
        <P>I do not anticipate that the contributions levied will unduly affect the price of houses and the level of inflation. The major driver of house price increases in recent years has been the demand for housing, fuelled by rapid economic growth and demographic changes. The Government has responded to this unprecedented demand by focusing on measures to boost supply as the most appropriate way to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases. The key component of this strategy is ensuring a supply of serviced land for housing which the development contribution system helps fund.</P>
        <P>Provisions governing the acquisition of land at existing use value for the provision of social and affordable housing are set out in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

        <P>Bundled DBO procurement of treatment and disinfection facilities accords with the recommendations of the national rural water monitoring committee and is being implemented in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. Facilities provided under these arrangements remain in the ownership of the group water scheme. The powers of a local authority to take in charge a group scheme are not affected by the existence of a DBO contract.</P>
        <P>Reducing the level of unaccounted for water is a priority in the case of group schemes participating in DBO projects. Grants are available for a range of remedial actions and water conservation measures to reduce water losses, including the provision of bulk meters and telemetry and the upgrading and renewal of inadequate water storage and distribution systems. My Department, in conjunction with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the Water Services National Training Group, also provides a range of training courses for group scheme managers, caretakers and operatives in the areas of leak detection, network management and maintenance, and water conservation.</P>

As in any case where new procedures are introduced, there were a number of issues of concern to interested parties but I am satisfied that these have been addressed.

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In terminating the new house grant, the Government has sought to ensure fair treatment by ensuring that people who had already made commitments in the form of signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations or had occupied their houses on or before 14 November 2002 were given an opportunity to apply for the grant. In providing a grace period up to 4 December 2002 for cases such as these, first-time buyers who were at the most advanced stage of purchase or building are being facilitated as far as possible.</P>
        <P>Regulations setting out the circumstances on which new house grants would be paid after 14 November 2002 came into force on the day of the announcement. My Department published an advertisement in the national press on 15 November 2002 setting out the conditions for new house grant payment as stipulated in the regulations. A further reminder was published in the press on Friday, 29 November 2002. Both press advertisements clearly stated that the closing date for receipt of applications was 4 December 2002.</P>
        <P>A total of 13,827 new house grant applications were received in the housing grants section of my Department in the three week period between 15 November 2002 and 4 December 2002. However, because of the difficulties that have been faced by some housing grant applicants in meeting the deadline of completing and occupying their new houses, I concluded that the fairest approach was to extend the deadline for completion, occupation and receipt of a request for payment of the grant in my Department to Friday, 2 April 2004. In returning their request for payment by the new deadline, applicants will have to produce evidence of occupation. It should be emphasised that this extension applies only to those who submitted valid applications received prior to the application deadline of 4 December 2002. Where all other conditions of the scheme are met, these applicants now have until Friday, 2 April 2004 to complete and occupy their house and return a request for payment to the Department. No exemptions were or will be provided for applications which do not respect these well publicised deadlines.</P>

Offences and penalties in relation to the registration of electors, including knowingly furnishing false information in an application for entry on the register, and the prohibition on voting by a person registered as an elector when not entitled to be so registered are also set out in electoral law.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued a memorandum for guidance to registration authorities for the preparation of the register of electors including such matters as consideration of applications from persons with more than one address and consultations, where appropriate, with other registration authorities. Section 11 of the Electoral Act 1992 specifically prohibits the registration of a person as an elector more than once in any registration area and in more than one registration area.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.

        <P>Older people, that is, people aged 65 and over, who are living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable, are eligible for assistance under the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1007, 1010, 1013 and 1017 together.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that my Department will decentralise to two locations &mdash; the Irish language functions to Na Forbacha, Galway, where my Department already has an office, and <Col N="769"/>the remaining functions to Knock Airport, County Mayo.</P>
        <P>It is also intended to decentralise a section of ADM to Clifden, County Galway and subject to the approval of the North/South Ministerial Council, 30 staff of Foras na Gaeilge will move to Gweedore in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>To advance the decentralisation process in my Department, a decentralisation unit has been established comprising a higher executive officer and a clerical officer, reporting to the personnel officer. A departmental committee comprising members of senior management and staff has also been established. The first meeting of this committee was held on Wednesday, 14 January and a liaison officer has been appointed to maintain direct contact with the central implementation committee and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Two special meetings of the partnership committee have taken place to date to brief staff on issues arising relating to decentralisation. Appropriate contacts with union interests are also being maintained and a full briefing of information available to date has been given to the union representatives through our departmental council. Arrangements have also been put in place whereby I will meet with the decentralisation committee on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>All staff have access to a special decentralisation corner on our computer network in which relevant information regarding decentralisation is being posted. A regular bulletin will be circulated where answers to questions raised by staff are answered &mdash; the first of these issued on 16 January 2004.</P>
        <P>A survey has not taken place in my Department to determine the interest of staff in participating in the decentralising programme. However, officials working in the decentralisation unit are at present engaged in compiling information packs relating to the regions in question. It is intended that this information will assist staff in making informed decisions about their future work locations. The Department's training unit will also have a key role in supporting effective communications throughout this challenging change process. Information seminars on the decentralised locations will be held in due course.</P>
        <P>The assessment of the impact of risks to the organisation arising from decentralisation is clearly important. Drawing on the resources of the departmental committee and the experience of Departments which have decentralised functions in the past, this issue will be carefully considered and addressed over the coming period. My Department's membership of the central liaison committee will also assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>Timely intake of new staff and an appropriate training schedule can help ensure there will be no undue loss of expertise and knowledge in the Department arising from decentralisation.</P><Col N="770"/>

	<P>Coiste na n-larchim&iacute; was established in 1998. Under the Peace II Programme, &euro;658,564 has been allocated to Coiste na n-Iarchim&iacute; for the &lsquo;Process of Nation Building&rsquo; programme for the period June 2002 to May 2004.

	<P>The group referred to by the Deputy has, since 1998, been in receipt of core funding under the community development programme operated by my Department. The core funding provided to projects included in the programme allows for the employment of two full-time staff equivalent, together with the overheads and administration costs of running a resource centre. My Department does not generally provide funding above what is appropriate to meet this staffing norm. Accordingly, projects are expected to draw down additional funding for activities undertaken or services provided from the relevant Department or agency.</P>
        <P>The core funding to the group in 2003 amounted to &euro;87,000. The allocation to the group for 2004 is currently being determined.</P>
        <P>A limited amount of funding is also set aside each year to enable projects funded under the programme to apply for additional grants towards equipment, refurbishment, premises, education, training, networking and research. Given the limited amount of funding available, it is not always possible to fund every application submitted by projects. In this context, applications for funding in 2003 were asked to prioritise their application(s). The group in question has been successful in securing funding through this once-off grant scheme in previous years and in 2003 I approved a grant of &euro;3,050 towards the cost of running courses in confidence building through creative role play and drama, which the group identified as a priority over all other applications.</P>

	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy about the works on the Royal Canal aimed at re-opening the waterway from Dublin to the River Shannon is the day to day responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, set up under the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
        <P>The Royal Canal is open to navigation between Dublin and Abbeyshrule, County Longford, a distance of 70 miles. Works to complete the restoration of the remaining 20 miles are in progress; the construction of five road bridges to replace existing culverts, lockgate installation, reconstruction of bog embankments, the provision of additional water supplies, as well as minor bank repairs.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000 &mdash; 2006, &euro;15 million, in 1999 terms, has been allocated to the Royal Canal restoration project. Waterways Ireland also informs me that it hopes to complete this project on time, subject to ongoing review in the light of other capital investment priorities and value-for-money trends in overall construction costs affecting the civil engineering industry.</P>

	<P>The public service broker is a key element in the Government's plans to streamline and modernise public service delivery. It will offer agencies a reliable way to share data electronically and provide a single point of access to public services for citizens and businesses. Initially these services will be available to those with domestic and business access to the Internet. However, the intention is to make the services available as soon as possible thereafter to the widest possible number of customers by means of the telephone and the network of public service local offices.</P><Col N="774"/>
        <P>The range of services is expected to grow quickly with the objective of having as many transactions as possible across the public service on-line i.e. without having to complete paper-based application forms. This will facilitate quicker transaction times, more timely delivery of services and the review of procedures to the benefit of both the public service customer and provider.</P>
        <P>Reach, the agency established to develop integrated public service delivery in an electronic environment, is in the process of finalising a contract for building the public service broker. This will allow Reach to move ahead with firm plans for the development and delivery of the broker, with an initial live delivery of services planned for June 2004.</P>

	<P>My overall focus for the Irish Presidency will be to advance the EU social policy agenda generally and in particular, make progress in delivering on the ten year goals set by the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</P>
        <P>One of the ambitious goals of the Lisbon agenda is to achieve greater social cohesion. Following the submission of the second round national action programmes on social inclusion 2003 &mdash; 2005 the Commission adopted its second report on social inclusion in December 2003. A joint Council-Commission inclusion report will be considered by the Council of Ministers in time for presentation to the spring European Council.</P>
        <P>The Irish Presidency will further develop an initiative taken by previous Presidencies by hosting a third meeting of people experiencing poverty. Our aim is to further develop ways of promoting participation by, and consultation with, people experiencing poverty in the context of developing policies in this area.</P>
        <P>A key policy area is &ldquo;Making Work Pay&rdquo;, which explores how the interaction between social protection and employment policies affects peoples decisions to seek, take up, and remain in work. As part of our contribution to modernising social protection systems, this issue was chosen as the main theme for discussion at the Informal Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Policy, which was held in Galway earlier this month. The meeting considered three specific aspects, namely, prevention and activation measures; reconciling work and family life and prolonging working life.</P>
        <P>Ministers and the Commissioner agreed that social protection systems need to strengthen the incentives and supports offered to people moving from benefits to work but that this should not call into question their primary role in providing adequate benefits to people who need them. Ministers also agreed to strengthen actions to improve incentives to work for older people and to minimise incentives for early retirement. The importance of striking a proper balance between employment and social protection policies in this area was also emphasised when my colleague, the Minister of State for labour, and I, in company with the Commissioner and our Dutch and Luxembourg colleagues, met with EU-level social <Col N="776"/>partners and social platform at our Troika meeting.</P>
        <P>The Irish Presidency will work to secure, for the first time, an agreed high level key messages paper for the spring European Council which will reflect in an integrated way the Council's work on social inclusion, pensions, demographic developments, making work pay, gender equality and the employment-related policy challenges addressed in the report of the European employment task force and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The issue of migration is another of our priorities for my Department during the Irish Presidency. We will be hosting a conference in April, the theme of which will be &ldquo;Reconciling Mobility and Social Inclusion&rdquo;. Its main focus will be on the role of social and employment policies in achieving social inclusion for people moving within the EU.</P>
        <P>A major priority in this context for the Irish Presidency will be to work for adoption by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament of the proposals to simplify and modernise the EU regulations on social security of migrant workers. This will provide workers and their families moving within the EU with a more streamlined set of rules aimed at protecting their social security and health care rights.</P>
        <P>Following the accession of the ten new member states in May next, we will host a special conference, in co-operation with the Hungarian Government and the Commission. The conference will address both the implications of the current reform of the regulations for all 25 states and the particular implementation challenges facing new member states in this field.</P>
        <P>In the area of family policy and to mark the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, the Irish Presidency will host a major international conference the title of which will be &ldquo;Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am happy that these events represent a substantial Irish Presidency programme of work which will make a significant contribution to moving forward the EU social policy agenda.</P>

	<P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 305, which I answered on 17 December 2003, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which <Col N="778"/>is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, allows a health board to make a single payment, known as an exceptional needs payment, to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.</P>
        <P>The Western Health Board has advised that some 35 exceptional needs payments were issued to families affected by the landslide. The board has confirmed also that every family in the affected area was visited and that all applications for assistance were approved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare legislation currently provides for the gradual reduction of the qualified adult allowance, QAA, for claimants of certain welfare payments, where the qualified adult is earning &euro;88.88 or more up to &euro;210 per week, at which point the QAA is fully withdrawn. The initial threshold of &euro;88.88 together with the gradual withdrawal ensure that a spouse is not unduly penalised for taking up employment.</P>
        <P>A number of changes to these tapered arrangements have been introduced in recent years to ensure that the impact of increases in earnings are not negated for families where the spouse is the sole earner and is in low paid employment. For example, the range of income over which the QAA is withdrawn has been progressively extended. For instance, in 1999 the QAA was withdrawn over an income range of &euro;76.18 to &euro;114.28. The current range is &euro;88.88 to &euro;210.00. Furthermore, whereas prior to March 2000 the child dependant allowance, CDA, was halved where a tapered rate of QAA was payable, full CDA is now payable in such cases.</P>
        <P>The question of further extending the QAA income range would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.</P>

	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is designed to provide assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear for children attending primary and post-primary schools. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he/she <Col N="779"/>is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and has household income at or below certain set levels.</P>

	<P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
        <P>In the case of asylum seekers who are catered for within the direct provision system which is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform a reduced rate of supplementary welfare allowance is paid to take account of the fact that they are provided with full board and other services within that system.</P>
        <P>My Department does not publish details of expenditure relating specifically to asylum seekers. Details of social welfare recipients' immigration status are not held on my Department's computer systems. It is not possible, therefore, to identify expenditure relating specifically to asylum seekers. However, the Department's records show that expenditure in 2003 under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases where the head of household was a non-national was in the region of &euro;132.5 million. The expenditure includes payments to people who are asylum seekers, former asylum seekers who have been granted leave to remain in the State by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, refugees and other non-nationals with no present or former connection to the asylum system.</P>
        <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as unemployment payments, one-parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers and costs involved in these categories are not available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare legislation provides for the payment of unemployment benefit in respect of days of unemployment. Any day on which a person either receives or has an entitlement to holiday pay is not regarded as a day of unemployment and a person has no entitlement to unemployment benefit in respect of that day.</P>
        <P>With the exception of people in school-related employment, people in seasonal, term or limited contract employment who claimed unemployment benefit up to 2003 had to supply details of all holiday pay entitlements due during each temporary lay-off period. Negotiations between the Department of Education and Science and the teacher unions on the implementation of the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 were concluded last year. This Act provides for additional holiday pay in certain cases. Following the conclusion of these negotiations, the provisions in relation to the treatment of accrued holiday pay for unemployment benefit purposes generally were extended to people in school-related employment. These provisions are that unemployment benefit is not paid in respect of any day for which there is an entitlement to holiday pay. The new procedures are designed to ensure that all persons on temporary lay-off from their employment were treated in a similar manner.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the principal conditions for receipt of the allowance is that full-time care and attention is required and being provided by the carer. Under the legislative provisions full-time care and attention means that the care recipient must be so disabled as to require continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with their normal personal needs. In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled as to be likely to require this care for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>My Department takes the view that full-time care and attention does not necessarily mean 24 hours in each day. Full-time care and attention can be considered to apply where there is an ongoing and daily commitment by the carer, and which also generally results in the carer not being able to support himself or herself through normal full-time employment.</P>
        <P>Carer's allowance applications are assessed on an individual basis having regard to the medical and other related evidence supplied by the applicant. However, as the objectives of the carer's allowance scheme are designed for full-time carers, part-time carers and carers of persons in residential care do not fall within the scheme objectives.</P>

	<P>The maximum period for which unemployment benefit can be paid is 390 days. If, at the end of a period of unemployment, a person has not exhausted his/her full 390 days entitlement, the remaining days of entitlement are carried forward to the next linked period of unemployment.</P>
        <P>The person concerned had a number of linked unemployment benefit claims in the period from October 2000 to January 2004. On 7 January 2004, the total number of days of unemployment over the period reached 390. The person concerned, however, requalified for a further 390 days' benefit from the 8 January 2004, based on his contribution record.</P>
        <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable is determined by reference to the person's weekly earnings in the governing contribution year, currently 2002. At present, to receive the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, a claimant must have had average weekly earnings of at least &euro;150 in the governing contribution year.
