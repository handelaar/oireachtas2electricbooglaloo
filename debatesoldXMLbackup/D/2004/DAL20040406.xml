   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 46, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>As part of our current Presidency of the European Union, I chaired the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 25 and 26 March. The Council conclusions and the declaration on combating terrorism adopted at the meeting have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. As Deputies are aware, on Tuesday, 30 March, the earliest opportunity following the European Council, I made a comprehensive statement in the House on the outcome of the Council. I also answered questions on the Council following the statements. I do not, therefore, propose to go into too much detail again.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the spring European Council was a successful one for the European Union and significant progress was achieved. We adopted a declaration on combating terrorism; agreed to resume our negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference and reach agreement no later than our next meeting in June; identified what needs to be done to promote sustainable growth and more jobs; and discussed a range of foreign policy issues and adopted conclusions, including on the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Russia. While I had no bilateral meetings on the margins of the European Council, I did have a joint meeting with the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament before the Council.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 31 March, I presented my report on the outcome of the spring European Council to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. I received positive feedback from MEPs on the progress achieved so far by Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.</P>
    <P>Once again I condemn in the strongest possible terms the appalling atrocity that took place in Madrid on 11 March in which nearly 200 people lost their lives and many hundreds were injured. I was struck by the wonderful sense of solidarity displayed by people throughout the European Union who participated in the three minutes&rsquo; silence on 15 March which had been requested by the Irish Presidency in commemoration of those who died or were injured.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 24 March, I attended a ceremonial Mass for the victims of the bombings in Madrid. It was a moving event which allowed us to pray for and pay our respects to the victims and show our solidarity with the Spanish people at this difficult time.</P>
    <P>The challenge for us as holders of the Presidency has been to respond to these terrible events in an appropriate way. An emergency meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers took place on 19 March and, as holders of the <Col N="542"/>Presidency, we dedicated the first session of the spring European Council on 25 March to a discussion on the European Union&rsquo;s response to the terrorist attacks in Madrid. As I have mentioned, the European Council adopted a declaration on combating terrorism and a related declaration on solidarity against terrorism, which comprise a range of practical measures aimed at greatly enhancing our ability to better protect our citizens.</P>
    <P>We also appointed the former Dutch interior Minister, Mr. Gjis de Vries, as the EU&rsquo;s first counter-terrorism co-ordinator. I have undertaken an intensive round of consultations with my counterparts on the Intergovernmental Conference over the past three months. Since I last reported to the House, I have met a number of EU leaders in Dublin, including Prime Minister Barroso of Portugal on 4 February, Chancellor Schr&ouml;der on 9 February following his meeting with President Chirac in Berlin earlier that day, Prime Minister Parts of Estonia on 16 February, Prime Minister Vanhanen of Finland on 23 February, Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg on 2 March, Prime Minister Spidla of the Czech Republic on 3 March, Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark on 10 March, Prime Minister Blair on 11 March and Prime Minister Dzurinda of the Slovak Republic on 12 March.</P>
    <P>On 12 February, I travelled to Rome for a meeting with Prime Minister Berlusconi. We reviewed the substantial progress made on the IGC under his chairmanship. I underlined our determination to build on this progress during the Irish Presidency. The Prime Minister set out Italy&rsquo;s views in a clear and positive way and I welcomed his insights. We also reviewed a range of issues on the EU agenda, including the Lisbon agenda, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals on the financial perspectives and a range of foreign policy issues of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>I met the former chairman of the European Convention, Mr. Val&eacute;ry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, during his visit to Dublin on 11 March last. We had a useful meeting and I was interested to hear his perspective on the key issues outstanding in the IGC.</P>
    <P>On Monday, 22 March, I travelled to Paris for discussions with President Chirac. This meeting was a key element of the consultation process I have been undertaking. I briefed the President on my extensive contacts since the beginning of the year and he provided me with an important insight into the latest French thinking on the IGC. I was encouraged by his wholehearted support for our efforts and his determination to see the IGC concluded by the June European Council on 17 and 18 June.</P>
    <P>All these discussions, in both person and by telephone, were both useful and informative in terms of developing a better understanding of the concerns which remain and of assessing the possibilities for progress. The clear message which has come through is one of commitment to <Col N="543"/>moving forward with a view to finding a reasonable solution.</P>
    <P>I made a report to the European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 25 March. My report contained a summary account of the work done to date based on the extensive consultations that have taken place both at political and official level. It also outlined our overall assessment of the state of play, as well as our understanding of where scope for compromise and agreement might lie. Over dinner, we discussed how best to take matters forward over the coming months and, as I have mentioned, we agreed on the objective of concluding the IGC at the European Council in mid-June.</P>
    <P>There is consensus that the new constitution will be good for Europe. It will contribute to greater understanding of what the Union is, what it does and why. With ten new countries joining on 1 May, it contains provisions necessary to enable the Union to develop and grow further in this new context. As I made clear to my European Council colleagues, I believe that early agreement is possible if we have the collective imagination to keep the wider picture in mind. The universal message I have received from partners is that delay will not make matters any easier. It is in all our interests to reach agreement on the constitutional project as soon as possible, particularly in view of the difficult discussions on other issues, such as the future financing of the Union, which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>On 22 January, I met a UNICE group led by its president, Dr. Strübe. The group presented me with a short paper which outlined UNICE&rsquo;s main areas of interest in regard to the Irish Presidency of the European Union and, in particular, for the spring European Council. The discussions focused mainly on European competitiveness and employment issues. In addition, we discussed the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and institutional issues. I had a further meeting with UNICE prior to the European Council on 25 March. I also had a meeting with a delegation from the European Trade Union Confederation on 13 January. Meetings of this kind with social partners are critical to boosting the role that social dialogue can play in progressing, and ultimately achieving, the overall Lisbon goal.</P>
    <P>The French Foreign Minister, Mr. Dominique de Villepin, paid a courtesy call on me in Government Buildings on 30 January. We discussed a range of issues, including the Intergovernmental Conference and the Lisbon agenda.</P>
    <P>I met the United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Adviser on Cyprus, Mr. Alvaro de Soto in Dublin on 16 February last. I congratulated Mr. de Soto on the excellent work carried out by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his team in New York the previous week which resulted in the announcement on 13 February that the Greek and Turkish Cypriots had committed to negotiating in good faith to achieve a <Col N="544"/>comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem before 1 May 2004. I assured Mr. de Soto that the EU would continue to support strongly the central role of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I had a further opportunity to meet Mr. de Soto in Government Buildings yesterday. He briefed me on the outcome of the recently concluded UN-led negotiations. I acknowledged the long-standing effort of the UN Secretary General to create a unique and historic opportunity for a settlement to the Cyprus problem. The decision on the plan for a settlement as presented to the parties by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on 31 March now rests ultimately with the people of Cyprus who will vote in separate simultaneous referenda on 24 April.</P>
    <P>I addressed the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 24 January in my capacity as President of the European Council. In my speech, I outlined the priorities which the Irish Presidency is addressing in the context of the Lisbon agenda, as well as my determination to step up its implementation. The full text of my speech can be viewed on the Irish Presidency website. My attendance at the forum afforded an ideal opportunity to inform an international audience of business leaders about the Presidency&rsquo;s ongoing agenda in regard to the ongoing economic, social and environmental programme that is the Lisbon agenda.</P>
    <P>On 2 February, I addressed a conference on sustainable development co-hosted by the European Environment Bureau, the European Trade Union Conference and the Social Platform, and co-sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I outlined to the conference the Presidency&rsquo;s approach to sustainable growth as part of the Lisbon agenda.</P>
    <P>On 18 February, Prime Minister Blair, Chancellor Schr&ouml;der and President Chirac wrote jointly to me and President Prodi outlining the issues discussed at their trilateral meeting that day. The letter contained a number of proposals and suggestions on how best the European Council might pursue the Lisbon agenda in the areas of innovation, employment and social cohesion. Many of the issues and suggestions referred to are ones that the Irish Presidency had been progressing in the context of the spring European Council. The proposal by the three leaders for the appointment of a vice-president of the Commission recognises the need for a co-ordinated and integrated response to the competitiveness challenges facing the European Union at all levels.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency has consistently underlined the importance of coherence in addressing the many reforms and targets which make up the Lisbon agenda and the need for a well co-ordinated approach. This need was reflected in the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s approach to last month&rsquo;s spring European Council, which called on the incoming Commission President to consider how to ensure the competitiveness <Col N="545"/>agenda is effectively supported. Of course, it would be a matter for the incoming President to consider the precise mandate and functions of the College of Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On 16 February, I received a joint contribution to the spring European Council from the Prime Ministers of Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Poland and Estonia. This contribution affirmed the support of the six leaders for the approach being taken. It also outlined their thoughts on specific areas, including innovation, research and development, competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the new Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Costas Karamanlis, by telephone on 22 March. I congratulated him on his election success and briefed him on the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s approach to the spring European Council and on my consultations on the IGC.</P>
    <P>I spoke to Jos&eacute; Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain&rsquo;s incoming Prime Minister, by telephone on 16 March. I offered my sympathies on the recent tragic events in Madrid and I briefed him on the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the proper response to the murderous atrocity in Madrid was shown by the Spanish people the following day when some 12 million demonstrated publicly, including native people and immigrants together, and that this, rather than lurching towards blunt, repressive legislation within the EU, shows the way forward? As we know, this type of legislation will often hit the innocent rather than the guilty.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response that he has been busy and has spoken to many European leaders. Will he state the present position after all the discussions regarding the proposal for a constitutional treaty for the European Union? What are the net issues outstanding and is he of the view that such a treaty will be agreed before the end of June?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that there is consensus among European leaders but no such consensus among many of the ordinary people of Europe, including those in this country. If the Taoiseach concludes the negotiations for a constitutional treaty before the end of June, when will the Irish people have an opportunity to debate in full both the issue and its far-reaching implications and vote on them in a referendum? Has there been any discussion at EU leadership level of whether the same right will be given to the people of Europe generally, in other words, to have a common popular referendum in every country in the EU on what by any standards is a far-reaching development within the Union?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The short answer to the first question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The action of the Spanish people on the Friday night in Madrid, throughout Spain and in cities throughout the world where there are Spanish people, including this city and many other cities throughout Ireland, was to <Col N="546"/>show their solidarity with those families who lost people and to try to do something practical to show their support for the families. I think they would also want European leaders, Ministers for Justice and everybody else to co-operate in an effort to prevent what happened to their people ever happening again.</P>
    <P>On the second issue, this was discussed at the European Council, in the European Parliament and in the European forum where we discussed this issue for some hours last Thursday. People want to see a European constitution. More than 200 parliamentarians worked hard and put in a major effort to bring about a conclusion to the Convention on the Future of Europe last year, and this has been brought forward by the IGC. There is a general wish for agreement and I hope that can be achieved. We must take it forward as best we can and do everything humanly possible. I hope it can be concluded. There is never any certainty in these issues. As I outlined last week, a number of issues are outstanding, such as weighted voting, qualified majority voting, QMV, the issue of a Commissioner per member state and the number of members in the European Parliament. There are many other outstanding budgetary and financial issues. Some countries still have concerns about issues and these have not been resolved. There are approximately 30 issues outstanding. We will do all we can in the remaining months of the Irish Presidency to bring it as far as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for every country to decide for itself whether to hold a referendum. There will be a referendum in this country. The normal time to hold a referendum is within 18 months to two years of the end of an IGC, but it has not been decided yet. As I stated to the House last week and at the forum, we should do our utmost to explain the issues although the work of the Convention greatly helped people to understand the issues, and that was quite clear from the meeting of the forum held a few days ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments at the European forum last Thursday, has the Taoiseach firmed up his view in respect of the central problem of qualified majority voting? How does he expect this issue to evolve? Does he, for instance, plan additional meetings with the Polish Prime Minister in view of the incoming Spanish Prime Minister&rsquo;s statements that he would like Spain to be more integrated with Europe and will adopt a more conciliatory approach to majority voting?</P>
    <P>In respect of his Presidency of the European Union and the seriously worsening crisis in Iraq, does the Taoiseach share the view that in many cases the Palestinian-Israeli problem is an alibi for terrorism in surrounding countries? In his capacity as President of the European Union, does he expect to raise with the United States President the issue of returning to the blueprint for peace which was published following the meeting in the Azores?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question may be more appropriate to the next group of questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since my remarks in response to Deputy Kenny last Thursday, I have spoken to the Polish Prime Minister again to try to make progress. I am conscious he will leave office in less than a month and there is still considerable uncertainty about what will happen afterwards. While there are divergent views on the matter, it could be some time before a new Prime Minister takes office and it is not clear exactly how that process will work out. I went through matters with the Prime Minister with whom I am due to speak again before the end of this week. I have put some proposals to him, including proposals from the Council secretariat that have been in the public domain.</P>
    <P>I am not due to meet the incoming Spanish Prime Minister until he assumes office. I have been in contact with him but it is not appropriate from his point of view to have a formal meeting until he takes office. I hope to have such a meeting and I will continue to explore the issues.</P>
    <P>There is still an extensive divergence of views within the political system in Poland, depending on whom one talks to or what one reads. One cannot know at this stage what will happen after the election of the new Prime Minister. Prime Minister Miller has been very helpful &mdash; he cannot read what will happen either &mdash; and both he and the President are trying as best they can to help the Presidency. I will return to the other issue the Deputy raised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of what the Taoiseach described as the key outstanding issues, is it correct to assume that whatever their nature at the end of the Italian Presidency, these issues remain but that there is a mood to move towards conclusion, and that it is not the case that some of the issues in question have been disposed of already? Assuming he will be successful in concluding a treaty, and I hope he will be, what are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on the process of ratification? Does he consider it likely that a referendum will be held this year?</P>
    <P>I have a question on a specific key outstanding issue. In his capacity as representative of Ireland as distinct from his role of President of all Europeans, as my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, describes it, what is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attitude to the retention of a Commissioner by all member states?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, the difficulty with the way the Council meeting ended in December was that many of the issues discussed from 5 October onwards were not tabled or discussed at the Council meeting. The issues addressed at bilateral and trilateral meetings involving the Italians and many other member states, particularly in November, were never tabled. People had concerns, problems and <Col N="548"/>difficulties. The Naples document was published but it was never discussed at the European Council. Therefore, one can never take it there was agreement on those issues. That complicates things further. It took us some time in January to try to figure out the Italian position and each member state&rsquo;s understanding of the Italian position. I am not blaming anybody for the process because it was a pointless exercise. The starting position was not the position that was portrayed when there were only four items and that is the difficulty. I am now clear on everybody&rsquo;s understanding but there is no agreement on that. All of those items, as the Deputy stated, are still in play and not agreed by anyone. Then there are the other big items, and we are clear on those.</P>
    <P>Another complication, which I already mentioned in the forum the other day, is that while much of the consultation was carried out in January and February, three new prime ministers attended the last European Council meeting and two others attended for the last time. Since I carried out the consultation in January and February, a fifth of the Council has changed, which makes life a bit difficult.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something which rarely happens in this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it does not happen in the middle of the Presidency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It happened in the middle of the last Presidency, unfortunately. That was a big mistake.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Deputy can appreciate how that makes things slightly different. With regard to ratification, the Polish situation worries me. I am trying to deal with a prime minister who is sincerely trying to be helpful. Unfortunately, this is not a clear process. My major concern is to have a Polish Government with which I can deal. Ratification takes between 18 months and two years. The forum urged that we do not rush it and have a period of consultation. To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly, I do not think it will be ratified in 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Commission?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have long held a view that each member state should still have one Commissioner. This should continue for quite a while, some have mentioned 2012 or maybe even 2014. Ultimately, my own personal view is that it will change. The IGC group already consists of 27 members. Some countries are debating whether they should join, some countries have made their applications. Norway and Switzerland will review the situation again over the next few years. We are going to end up with a European Union of over 30 member states. How many more than 30 is a debate for the future. I hope it <Col N="549"/>does not go too much further than 30. Having 30 or more Commissioners would be unwieldy and I support a small Commission as long as there is strict equality of rotation. Some have said 18, others have said 15, but I do not have any difficulty as long as there is strict equality of rotation. It looks like we will wait another decade before that decision is made. God knows what decision an IGC may make on that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I share in the sympathy expressed by him and others to all the relatives of those who died and were injured in the Madrid atrocities. In light of that and following the visit by the Taoiseach to America during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s festival, did the Taoiseach discuss security arrangements for the visit of President George W. Bush? Were non-Irish security measures discussed, particularly with regard to the US airforce?</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question does not arise in this group of questions. It will arise in the next group.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The 46 questions were pretty comprehensive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but there is another group of questions following that group, to which the Deputy&rsquo;s question would be more appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, to move on to the Lisbon Agenda. The Taoiseach mentioned the stepping up of its implementation. In light of his meeting with the Union of Industrial and Employers&rsquo; Confederations of Europe and given that he spoke about sustainability, does he regard the Kyoto Protocol as being subject to a cost benefit analysis from the point of view of the Lisbon Agenda? Given that he talked about sustainable growth rather than sustainability <i>per se</i>, will he state whether the Lisbon Agenda is to supersede the targeting of the Kyoto Protocol? I ask this because in his address at the Davos World Economic Forum in January, he did not refer too much to the goals of the EU summit in Gothenburg in 2001. Is he purposely leaving these out? When he mentions the environment, he mentions it once and in the context of the business environment.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to talk about corporate responsibility and the failure of the Millennium Declaration, which established goals on health, education, security and human rights to be reached by 2015? Will this be part of the agenda the Taoiseach is setting for the EU Presidency on behalf of Ireland or is it to be left out intentionally?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lisbon Agenda is based on the economy and social and environmental issues. I agree that the Gothenburg conclusions are parts of that. My second meeting with the employers &mdash; the one prior to the Council &mdash; was very much <Col N="550"/>on Kyoto. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has been pressing very much at the other Council meeting the idea that we must proceed and that we should not be waiting to see what will happen in the United States or dwelling on its concerns about what will happen in Russia. From an overall economic and environmental point of view, I would rather see the United States and Russia make the appropriate decisions. That is an issue we will be raising with both the US and Russia in both our summits from an EU point of view. It is a key issue on which to try to press them.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I can assure the Deputy that we are continuing to state what the responsibilities are. I made it very clear to the employers that I do not think it a good tactic for them, irrespective of the arguments we are making, to defer these decisions to the second block, which is the block from 2008 to 2012. I stated they would do much better to make the policy decisions early on and phase it in because they will not escape it. As Deputy Sargent knows, there is an inclination to defer decision making but we have been indicating to the employers that this is the wrong thing to do. We have made this very clear in both the workshops at the Davos World Economic Forum and at the full meeting, where I met the executives of all the employers&rsquo; groups of all 15 countries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach met the president of the Union of Industrial and Employers&rsquo; Confederations of Europe, did he raise the issue of trade union recognition? Does he recognise that this issue is of growing concern in Ireland, the rest of Europe and globally? Effectively, trade unions are being pushed out of the workplace and employees are being denied their basic right of representation by trade unions. Does the Taoiseach agree that while the right to membership of trade unions may be covered in law, it is rendered null and void if employers refuse to recognise the union as the body that represents workers and negotiates on their behalf? Did the Taoiseach discuss this issue with the president of the employer&rsquo;s confederation? As President of the EU, does he have plans to launch any initiative in the course of the Irish Presidency to improve the situation and to address the difficulties with trade unions and the employer&rsquo;s confederation to copperfasten union recognition?</P>
    <P>I join other Deputies in expressing once again my abhorrence and that of my party at the Madrid atrocities. Does the Taoiseach agree that the subsequent result of the Spanish general election was indicative of a rejection by the Spanish people of the Aznar Government&rsquo;s spin and, I suppose, deception during the war in Iraq and following the bombings in Madrid when it sought to lay the blame at another&rsquo;s door? Does he believe that in his capacity as EU President and from his experience of the Irish peace <Col N="551"/>process, he now has an opportunity to recommend to the new Spanish Government that it address the Basque-Spanish conflict through an inclusive dialogue, the opportunity of people having the right to freely express their positions and through exploring the resolution of the difficulties that are clearly there by the same means as we have sought to address our age-old conflict? Does he agree that must also include the unbanning of political parties so that an inclusive process can get under way?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At European level, union recognition is not a major item on the agenda. Countries have different positions, both constitutional and legal, and have different operational ways of working it, so it has not been a big issue. The rights of members has been an issue as has the issue of negotiation which has been the issue here and with which the T&aacute;naiste has been dealing.</P>
    <P>On the Spanish issue, I am sure people will reflect for some time on what happened in the remaining days of the last government. It is not something on which I will dwell. It would be good and useful if there could be an overall, peaceful settlement to the Basque question. As a first step to that, if people were to move away from all forms of violence, it would help. Mr. Aznar has been a hard fighter against ETA for many years, and he expressed his views on this. I suppose he had good reason to be since ETA almost killed him. That helps to focus the mind and he has continued to take a strong line. There seems to be some indication of efforts to try to establish a ceasefire, reach a peaceful solution and to move on. That would be helpful but it is a matter for the incoming Spanish Government to try to make progress, as Mr. Aznar has worked hard to do over the years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the role of Gijs de Vries, who is to be the EU terrorism co-ordinator, how exactly will his functions fit in with those currently exercised by Europol and Eurjust? Will he have any authority over those bodies or over whom will he have authority? Is this just an appointment for the sake of one in the wake of an atrocity?</P>
    <P>On the battle against terrorism, does the Taoiseach agree that progress has been extremely slow in terms of passing legislation following the decisions he took at the Tampere summit in 1999 on the battle against cross-border crime? Does he agree one of the reasons progress has been extremely slow is because of the insistence on continued unanimity by his Government and others on these matters and that as a result, we have not been able to live up to the Tampere agenda which the Taoiseach and others set as far back as 1999? Does he agree that the proposal in the Italian Presidency compromise to introduce an emergency break, which would neuter the proposals of the Convention on qualified <Col N="552"/>majority voting on crime, will ensure the deadlock on this matter will continue for the next five to ten years?</P>
    <P>On the voting issue, in the event that the Dublin majority formula cannot be a solution, will the Taoiseach consider examining the formula used for allocating seats in the European Parliament as a basis for weighting votes in a single majority system in the Council, namely, degressive proportionality? Is he aware of mathematical studies which show how degressive proportionality could be used as a comprehensive weighting system which could be incorporated in the treaty, which would not have the difficulties that the Dublin majority has, which would be automatic every time there was enlargement and which would not require a fundamental renegotiation? Will the Taoiseach examine degressive proportionality, which the Convention has already agreed to with the parliament, being used as a way of breaking the deadlock in regard to the Council weighting?</P>

	<P>On the role of the counter-terrorism co-ordinator, the EU high representative, Javier Solana, has appointed Gjis de Vries to the role of terrorism co-ordinator. He will be a central figure who will work with the Council secretariat and Mr. Solana. He will be the central figure in taking forward the measures agreed at the European Council. His key task will be to ensure co-ordination between the different bodies, including Europol, Eurojust, the member states and the institutions in implementing a comprehensive EU strategy to combat terrorism. He will be delegated the power and authority to try to co-ordinate the effort. The difficulty identified in the past is that people sign up to do something, not just because of qualified majority voting, and then they do not get on with it. He will try to co-ordinate the effort, which is not being done at present. His primary role will be as an internal co-ordinator. There will also be an important external dimension to ensure the EU counter-terrorism priorities in political dialogue with third countries and international organisations are consistent with the priorities in the internal fight.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the Tampere agenda has not been implemented. A significant amount of that agenda has been completed. One of the initiatives of the Irish Presidency is to draw up a report on what has been implemented of the action programme. Part of it relates to what was done at the spring European Council and another to what we must do going forward. I agree with Deputy Bruton that the unanimity issue has delayed matters. I do not think there is a chance of the Italian proposal being agreed to. It was a good try but I do not think it will work. I have indicated strongly everywhere that we must be more forthcoming in this regard because the Deputy is correct in his analysis that we will not make the necessary progress.</P><Col N="553"/>
    <P>On the weighted voting system, I will consider what Deputy Bruton said. We have considered many suggestions. This is not a crystal clear issue but I believe the debate is an acceptance of the double majority principle. There may have to be some variation of the issue to reach a final resolution. While people accept the double majority principle, there are a range of arguments, including issues such as percentages, the number in the blocking minority and population levels. The numbers being mentioned range from 12% to 25% of the population and two to four countries. There is not an agreed position on the matter, particularly from Poland and Spain, which continues to be a problem. I am examining some of the initiatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Proportionality might be easier for Poland and Spain to accept.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It could be. The major difficulty they have is that they continue to think negatively and the only issue they consider is their ability to block. Going forward with the new constitution, it is very difficult to get them to see that they should be looking at the positive aspects and how to move forward. The whole debate with both countries centres around their ability to block. Smaller countries do not look at it in that way, they look at making the system work. I have said at Council, at press conferences and straight to the countries that this is an entirely negative way of proceeding. We must try to find a resolution and I will look at what the Deputy suggests.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
     <Quest>if a final decision has been reached regarding the refurbishment of the national theatre on its present site, in view of the difficulties being encountered in acquiring the necessary additional property adjacent to the existing site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10663/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>On foot of Government decisions of 19 February 2002 and 29 January 2003, the Office of Public Works has carried out a preliminary assessment of the property acquisition issues arising in the context of redeveloping the national theatre at its existing location via a public private partnership. This assessment indicates that the acquisition of property which would be essential for redevelopment at the existing location could be very costly and time-consuming. Redevelopment at the existing location would thus appear to be problematic.</P><Col N="554"/>
    <P>As a result, I am considering how this development should progress, in view of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide a new home for the national theatre and of the critical importance of this development to national cultural life.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in this matter. The replacement of the Abbey Theatre as a national institution is a priority and should be a national project. Will the Minister confirm the decision not to go ahead with a redevelopment on the existing site?</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works and the Abbey Theatre project teams worked together and produced a blueprint of the theatre&rsquo;s requirements. That design could fit into the Carlton site, depending on how much ground is made available. There is a court case related to that at present and the Minister cannot indicate the outcome at this stage but is it one of the locations that is being considered? Are other locations in the Dublin docklands or on a greenfield site being considered? Is the Minister happy with the agreed blueprint of requirements produced by the Office of Public Works and the Abbey Theatre project team in terms of the needs of the Abbey Theatre as the national theatre?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is agreed that the new theatre must be a signature development that is reflective of a national theatre in the 21st century and that it should be in an appropriate civic setting and form part of the overall urban regeneration represented by the O&rsquo;Connell Street integrated area plan and the north-east inner city plan. Clearly, three significant enlarged auditoria are required, as are a dedicated education and outreach facility, a publicly accessible archive, a restaurant and bar, public areas, disabled access for audiences and artists, best practice theatre production facilities and a third multi-purpose space outside the significantly enlarged auditoria.</P>
    <P>A theatre on the present Abbey Theatre site would be extremely problematic and, in those circumstances, it appears there will be little alternative other than to look elsewhere. In this context, the Carlton cinema site will have to be viewed as an option but that will become clearer after judgment has been given in the High Court hearing into Dublin City Council&rsquo;s CPO.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has confirmed that it is not intended to proceed with problematic acquisitions on the existing site &mdash; that is progress. I visited the Abbey Theatre last week with Deputy Deenihan and, to put it mildly, the facilities, space and entire area are totally outdated, outmoded and antiquated. I compliment the 100 or so staff on their work in promoting our national culture. The backstage and upstairs of the building are too cramped, crowded, damp, dark and unfit. In that context, I support the Minister&rsquo;s view.</P><Col N="555"/>
    <P>The centenary of the founding of the Abbey Theatre will be 27 December. Will the Minister arrange for talks to resume between the OPW, his Department and the Abbey Theatre to update the necessary requirements for a national theatre of which we can be justly proud in this centenary year?</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to prejudice the court case but does he have a personal preference for the theatre to be placed in a city centre, for example, on O&rsquo;Connell Street, given the three high standard criteria he has laid down or is he willing to look at a greenfield site, for example, in the docklands area?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>There is general recognition that a national theatre should be a signature development. Most people would prefer to see the new national theatre in the centre of the city. In this regard, the plans for the rejuvenation and regeneration of O&rsquo;Connell Street come to mind. It is clear that, despite our living in one of the most imaginative and creative generations of Irish people, there is no architectural public expression of that creativity or imagination and this project presents the opportunity to do precisely that. I sincerely hope that an adequate site becomes available &mdash; in the city centre preferably &mdash; because that is what most people desire. It would contribute greatly to the rejuvenation of O&rsquo;Connell Street, which is something everyone regards as desirable.</P>
    <P>However, we are faced with the difficulty of acquiring a site. It is clear from the OPW&rsquo;s report that there are serious problems in regard to the present Abbey Theatre site in respect of cost and time. In those circumstances, as I indicated earlier to Deputy Kenny, it will be necessary to look elsewhere and the Department is doing that. The Carlton cinema site is one option but the outcome of a reserve judgment from the High Court is awaited.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
     <Quest>the trends he has identified in the latest tourism and travel figures from the Central Statistics Office; his views on whether the underlying trend still leaves cause for concern for the Irish tourism sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10838/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
    <P>The most up-to-date CSO statistics for 2003 show a 5% increase in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland, representing a continuing recovery in this vital sector of the economy. In numerical terms, visitor numbers have exceeded the previous peak achieved in 2000, with 6.3 million visits recorded. In conjunction with the growth in volume terms, revenue earnings grew by just under 3%, at over &euro;4 billion.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, 2003 showed a marginal net outflow of earnings on the tourism and travel account of &euro;58 million. This is hardly surprising as expenditure by Irish tourists on holidays overseas has been on an upward trend as a result of the greater prosperity experienced by Irish people in recent years. This greater prosperity has also provided a major boost to Ireland&rsquo;s domestic tourism market, which remains central to Ireland&rsquo;s continuing tourism success. A separate CSO release &mdash; the household travel survey &mdash; indicates that more than 5 million domestic trips were taken in the first nine months of last year, representing an increase of 3.4% on the same period in 2002. In expenditure terms, the first nine months of 2003 have also shown very positive results. Between January and September, more than &euro;745 million was spent on domestic trips in comparison with &euro;645 million in the same period in 2002. This represents a substantial increase of 16%, which far outstrips the growth in expenditure by Irish people on foreign holidays, at 5%, last year.</P>
    <P>While the two surveys are not directly comparable, they provide a strong indication that <Col N="557"/>the home market remains buoyant and continues to win market share against stiff international competition. In terms of other trends emerging from the CSO figures on international travel, I would make a number of comments. As a tourism destination for overseas visitors, Ireland continues to out-perform many of its nearest competitors.</P>
    <P>The Iraq war, the outbreak of SARS and a weak global economy all played a part in suppressing the demand for international tourism last year. Worldwide, the number of tourists fell by 1.2% and Europe&rsquo;s performance was at best flat, according to the World Tourism Organisation. With growth rates of 5% in volume terms, Ireland is clearly increasing its share of a highly competitive marketplace.</P>
    <P>It is also apparent that the North American market, particularly the US, has finally turned the corner with numbers beginning to rise again. US visitor numbers to Ireland increased by over 6% in 2003 despite the impact of the war, increased threats of terrorism and SARS. This compares to a 1% increase in the number of Americans visiting Europe generally and a decrease of 8% experienced by Britain.</P>
    <P>Continental Europe, a market which has remained stagnant for a number of years, is also looking positive with visitor numbers up in the order of 8%. A 4% growth figure for Britain last year was also a strong endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s continuing competitive edge in what is Ireland&rsquo;s largest tourism market by far. It is also clear that this performance has been hard won, with enormous pressure being placed on the industry&rsquo;s bottomline. It is also evident that this performance has not been shared equally, either on a regional or a sectoral basis. I am very conscious of growing concerns about the regional distribution of tourism growth in recent years. It should be recognised that all regions and sectors continue to experience growth &mdash; the issue relates to the growing disparity in the rate of growth between the regions.</P>
    <P>In this context, the development of good access, particularly air access, is key to strengthening the competitive position of the regions. Both tourism agencies recognise this issue and are investing significant time and resources in encouraging improved air links. Already, Knock and Galway airports are reaping the rewards of their efforts to promote direct access to the west, particularly from Britain.</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y" FLI="0">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
    <P el="0">Tourism Ireland has also taken a strategic decision to target significant promotional resources at family touring holidays, particularly from Britain, which favour the regions. Tourism Ireland is also investing significantly in the US market. The coach tour business will continue to feature strongly in their promotions and they will also be encouraging the growing number of independent travellers from the US to spend <Col N="558"/>longer and travel more extensively on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The marketing programmes in train for 2004 will build on the momentum generated in 2003, both on the international and domestic front. They are also being backed by an unprecedented level of Exchequer support for tourism services within my Department, particularly for marketing purposes, totalling well over &euro;110 million.</P>
   </Speaker><Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the figures the Minister highlighted today, which demonstrate that despite difficult times on the international scene, tourism has done well in Ireland. The number of visits by Irish people living abroad has dropped compared with the number of foreigners visiting Ireland. It will take several years before we know if that is a once-off statistic or represents a trend. What research has been done by the Department or by agencies under its aegis in this aspect of the tourism industry?</P>
    <P>Recently released figures show that 4.5 million of the 6.37 million foreign visitors to Ireland come from Britain or through Britain. This represents a major proportion of the tourism trade. Has a breakdown of that 4.5 million figure been done? Do these visitors consist of Irish families returning home for annual holidays or world travellers who come through Britain to Ireland and continue to another destination? How much time do these visitors spend in Ireland? This group, 4.5 million, represents a large proportion of the overall figure of 6.37 million.</P>
    <P>Regional development will be a major factor in the tourism industry. What influence can the Minister bring to bear on other Departments, such as the Department of Transport, or State agencies to ensure that the regions are developed more equally than at present?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department, as well as other Departments and State agencies, must rely on the figures we receive from the Central Statistics Office. The compilation of these figures is subject to the same criteria each year so they are comparable, year on year. It is clear from these figures that last year saw a record number of visitors to Ireland, something everyone will welcome. This is indicative of the resilience of the industry. Credit is due to the tourism agencies, to the industry itself and to the Government, which increased the marketing fund for tourism to its highest level ever. This money was well spent, not only in traditional markets but on the Continent, where we saw major increases in the number of visitors from non-traditional places such as France, Italy and Spain. These were particularly encouraging.</P>
    <P>The related question of access is extremely important and the growth in low cost travel to Ireland has been a direct contributor to the increase in numbers from the continent. I would like to see greater capacity from the continent and, particularly, greater air capacity from North <Col N="559"/>America. If capacity from the United States were improved the numbers would rise almost in parallel. One of the major difficulties experienced last year was the lack of capacity, particularly during the peak season. If we can increase capacity we will increase numbers.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s target is to increase the number of visitors to 10 million by the year 2012 and to double revenue during the same period. If we continue to see growth figures similar to those of last year, and which we anticipate this year, these targets are capable of being realised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Minister believe to be the cause of the net outflow of &euro;58 million when earnings from visitors to Ireland are compared with money spent by Irish people travelling abroad? If the Minister were responsible for trade and employment this reversal of fortune would be deeply embarrassing to him. Given the global economic uncertainty of recent years, which is being exacerbated by the policies of certain governments, what is the Minister&rsquo;s view of the drop in the number of stays in hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments by British visitors between 2002 and 2003? The only increase of note was in the number of British visitors who stayed with friends and relatives. Does the Minister agree that our cousins in Britain are visiting friends and relatives for a cheap holiday because they have been priced out of the market? Hotels and guest houses are too expensive and are seen as a rip-off. The same is true of our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Possibly because long-term package holidays include stays in hotels, the rise in prices is not so noticeable to visitors from the United States and Canada. However, in areas where discernment is significant, such as caravanning, camping and hostelling, numbers from the USA, Canada and other areas have also declined. Conditions appear to be returning to normality in the global age of terror in which we live. Nevertheless, does the Minister acknowledge that major structural change must be carried out in the tourism industry to ensure that quality sustainable tourism business comes to Ireland and that the rip-off mentality is stamped out.</P>
    <P>What is being done to exploit the potential of the midlands? The ecological sustainability of tourism on the western seaboard is being damaged by ongoing development and by traffic jams in places such as Clifden. Tourism growth in the midlands would not infringe on the industry&rsquo;s long-term potential.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister had further discussions with his Cabinet colleagues regarding the feasibility of the western rail corridor? If more US and Canadian visitors come to Ireland they will probably come through Shannon or Knock. If they are to proceed to further destinations in Ireland such a rail route will be necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="560"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Between 2002 and 2003 there was an increase in the number of bed nights in hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast establishments, rented houses and apartments, caravans, campsites and hostels. All the indices of the number of visitors from our various markets, and the revenue from each of them, have shown an increase. None has shown a decrease. That is the good news. During the year 2003, against a very difficult backdrop, Ireland experienced a record year.</P>
    <P>The fact that stays were of a shorter duration and money was not as plentiful led to a greater degree of pressure on profit margins. Some hotels, for example, had to drop their prices in order to attract visitors and some hotels found themselves in competition with guest houses. All of that is accurate and margins were tighter. None of that can mask the fact that we had an improvement against a difficult backdrop, that we are anticipating further improvement this year and that we are expecting a record year.</P>
    <P>As regards developing tourism in the midlands and other regions, the tourism development group has examined applications from less traditional areas of the country with a view to allocating funds to improve amenities. The allocation of these funds is ongoing. The Deputy might care to address the matter of the western rail corridor to the Minister for Transport. When addressing the question of the number of visitors travelling from Ireland abroad, it must be recalled that Ireland is a more prosperous country today than it was ten years ago. An increase in the number of foreign visits by Irish people is expected as a natural consequence of more prosperous times. The substantial increase in the number of domestic trips taken by Irish people is encouraging. An increase of &euro;100 million in revenue in a short period from &euro;645 million to &euro;745 million is encouraging.</P>
    <P>Regarding the allegation about &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo;, I do not subscribe to that theory. I have continually warned the tourism industry of the need to remain competitive and I have repeatedly advised it of the necessity to give value for money. It is a tough world and competition is becoming tougher by the day. It would be foolish to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that in excess of 90% of visitors to the country still express satisfaction with the holiday experience here, although, on the other side of that coin, it must be admitted that, in a few years, the number of people questioning the value for money which they have received has increased from one third to two thirds of total foreigner visitors. That is a matter of concern. The need to be vigilant must be clear to everyone.</P>

     <Quest>if he has received a report from the chairperson of the Arts Council regarding the scrapping of the Arts Plan 2002-<Col N="561"/>2006, which was included in the Programme for Government 2002-2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10664/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Plan 2002-2006 was prepared by the Arts Council and the Government had no part in its formulation. The council sought Government adoption of the plan that required funding of &euro;314 million over the period of the plan. The Government was happy to endorse the general objectives of the plan, namely, to make an arts career a realistic ambition for excellent and innovative artists; to broaden and enhance audiences for the arts; to raise standards in arts leadership and management; to broaden and enrich participation in the arts; to extend the international impact and success of Irish arts and artists; and to work with others to help bring the arts closer to local communities.</P>
    <P>However, our financial system, based on an annual Estimates cycle cannot accommodate the multi-annual financial commitment for which the arts plan called. For the Government&rsquo;s part, the phasing of the plan and the funding that could be provided in any given year would have to be addressed through the normal annual Estimates campaigns. There could never be any guarantee of funding being provided to meet the specific annual targets included in the plan by the Arts Council. Government endorsement of the broad objectives of the plan cannot restrict or constrain the council from changing or setting aside any part of its own plan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002 the then Minister and now Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, fully endorsed the plan and gave the impression that funding would be available. Does the Minister think the arts plan was scrapped because of the Government&rsquo;s neglect to provide sufficient funding? The Arts Council hoped to be allocated &euro;53 million in 2003, but received only &euro;44 million, which is approximately 83% of what was expected. In 2004 the plan was to be allocated &euro;61 million but received only &euro;53 million, which is 85% of what was expected. It will not be possible to implement the plan. Questions were asked at the council meetings about how the plan could be supported when it was not working. It was not working due to a lack of funding. The Government failed in that regard. The arts plan was scrapped because of the Government&rsquo;s neglect. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that. Would the director still be in place if the plan had been given proper support and if it had been funded by the Government? Did we let her down?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy English will be aware, Governments do not operate on a multi-annual Estimates basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not the impression given at the time.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="562"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Every Department must in each given year make its case for funding and then the Department and the Minister concerned must cut its cloth in accordance with the measure. The funding for the Arts Council in 2004 was substantially increased over 2003. The increase was 19% and the argument could be made that, if the Arts Council had decided to proceed with the arts plan, it would have had a sufficiency of funding to proceed with the portion which was appropriate to the year 2004. However, the views of various experts outside the Arts Council are of little consequence.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is charged under the new Arts Act with the administration of the arts on an independent basis. It is not my function nor the function of any expert to tell the Arts Council how it should or should not proceed. It is not possible for me or anyone else to tell the Arts Council who or what it should or should not fund. In the same way, the Arts Council makes a decision about its own arts plan. It is independent in the exercise of that function. It made a decision that it would proceed in a different direction. When the Arts Act was discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Opposition made much play of the fact that it was necessary, in so far as that was possible, to maintain the independence of the Arts Council. That is a position to which I subscribe and that is the situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The arts plan is about policy-making. The Minister said there was an increase in funding in 2004 over 2003. The funding in 2003 was less than that in 2002, which was a general election year. I wondered what was the reason for that. The impression was given that proper funding would be provided, but that did not happen. The Minister said it does not have any consequences, but that is not the case. There was a plan, but now there is none. How will funding be allocated this year and the following year?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Council is more than capable of carrying out its own functions without looking for advice from me and it has not sought any from me. The Arts Council is independent in the exercise of its function and there are a number of good reasons for that, not least the question as to whether there could or would be political interference in the arts world. Some people would regard that as undesirable. We sought to avoid that, in so far as it was reasonably possible, when framing the Arts Act 2003. I have every confidence in the Arts Council to frame policy and to bring forward solid <Col N="563"/>suggestions to advance the cause of the arts and artists in this country. My confidence in the Arts Council is 100%. I have no doubt it will serve the cause well and I have no reason to believe it will not do so.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Durkan</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
     <Quest>his Department&rsquo;s plans for the promotion of the arts, whether directly or through other agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10572/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal agency through which the arts are promoted is the Arts Council. The most fundamental tenet of Government policy is that financial support for the arts is channelled through the Arts Council, which is independent in the context of the disbursement of its funds. This will continue to be the case and I am delighted that I was able to secure an increase in 2004 of 19% on the 2003 figure, bringing the council&rsquo;s allocation in 2004 to &euro;52.5 million. I will, of course, continue to argue the case for the best possible funding for the promotion of the arts.</P>
    <P>The areas in which my Department has a more direct role include the provision of grant aid for arts and cultural infrastructure. My Department&rsquo;s access scheme provides for grants of &euro;45.71 million to the promoters of 44 projects around the country. The scheme is designed to lead to the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructure and covers three strands: new facilities; redevelopment of existing arts and culture facilities; and smaller community based projects. Particular emphasis was placed on community based projects and 17 such projects are among those approved.</P>
    <P>This scheme will lead to greater participation in the arts with a greater number of facilities being provided on a broad geographic basis. It is expected that the scheme will also result in the creation of direct and indirect employment in the arts and in the local economy generally. The scheme will lead to the input of almost &euro;58.4 million into arts capital infrastructure, taking into account matching funding being provided by project promoters. The projects range from the provision of new museums and new integrated art centres to the refurbishment of existing performance spaces.</P>
    <P>The cultural relations committee advises me on financial assistance for Irish artists and <Col N="564"/>performers who wish to exhibit or perform abroad. An amount of &euro;700,000 is available for distribution this year. I am considering how best to promote the international arts into the future and an examination of the options available is currently under way. The cultural programme associated with the Irish Presidency of the EU, with the festival of Irish art and culture in China taking place this year, are both being managed by my Department and will provide significant opportunities to showcase and promote Irish arts abroad.</P>
    <P>In the area of traditional arts, I have arranged for the appointment of a special committee to advise the Arts Council on supports for the traditional arts. This committee is to report to the council by September next.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an interesting reply, particularly given that a number of my questions have been refused on the basis that the Minister has no official responsibility to the House. Who initiates policy on the arts? When I put down a question about whether the Minister would meet the promoters of the Anna Livia International Opera Festival, I was again told that the Minister had no responsibility. If the Minister initiates policy &mdash; his reply indicates that he does &mdash; and if he wishes to promote the most suitable policy, would it not be in the interests of both the Minister and the Arts Council that the Minister meet those who are interested in promoting the various forms of the arts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My door has been open to meet people involved in the arts and I have met a considerable number of groups and people over the past year and ten months. There can be no question about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to policy funding and so forth, there can be no question of the Government being in a position to direct the Arts Council as to who or what it should or should not fund. That would be entirely contrary to the spirit and letter of the Arts Act 2003. There is limited provision in that Act for the Minister to direct the Arts Council to implement Government policy. However, that power was intended to be exercised exceedingly sparingly. It would apply, for example, if there were neglect of the disadvantaged or the disabled or in other such cases. However, neglect of that nature by the Arts Council is not envisaged.</P>
    <P>It is the function of the Minister of the day to direct the Arts Council to appoint a special committee to deal with any facet of the arts and for that body to give advice to the Arts Council. However, that is a far cry from the Minister dictating daily policy to the Arts Council.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not certain what the Minister means. He has complicated his first reply with his next. Is he suggesting that he does not direct policy but takes policy directives from the Arts Council or does he direct policy?</P>

<Col N="565"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Arts Council formulates policy. It decided, for example, that it would not proceed with the third arts plan, 2002-06. That is entirely a decision-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The council decided.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Arts Council decided it.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>It was because it was not funded by the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an argument the Opposition correctly made during the debate on the Arts Act and I agree with it, that the broad policy of the Arts Council should be a matter for the Arts Council. However, there are specific exceptions to that rule and I have outlined them.</P>

	<P>Order, please. The time for this question is almost exhausted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have concerns about touring groups being able to visit theatres throughout the country? Many of them are finding it difficult to put on shows. The touring groups are not in a financial position to deal with this problem. Can the Minister do anything to overcome the problems such groups are encountering? We have the facilities but we do not have these touring groups or the paid professions to perform.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>During the discussion on the Arts Act it was suggested that there should be a sub-group on education. Given that the best way to market the arts is to start with the youngest age group, has the Minister any thoughts on his Department and the Arts Council co-operating with the Department of Education and Science to ensure the promotion of the arts to children from a young age? Adulthood is not the optimum time to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions regarding funding for touring groups and all other artists are matters for the Arts Council alone. As I said earlier, the Minister has no say in that regard. The Minister has power to direct the Arts Council in exceptional circumstances to implement Government policy in one area or another. The Minister also has power to direct the Arts Council <Col N="566"/>to appoint a special committee. In this context, Deputy Keaveney&rsquo;s question is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Appointing special committees is a reserved function in the legislation. I directed the Arts Council to appoint a special committee to advise the Arts Council on the traditional arts, with the instruction that it report to the Arts Council by autumn this year at the latest. The Arts Council will be expected to implement the policy of the committee on the traditional arts, which will then be stood down. I have given consideration to a special committee to deal with the issue of education and the arts. It is something in which I have a particular interest because I agree with Deputy Keaveney&rsquo;s sentiment that if young people&rsquo;s creative processes are to be nurtured and encouraged, it should happen at the earliest possible time. The formative years are best.</P>
    <P>However, I do not wish to have a number of special committees sitting at the same time as it is preferable to concentrate on one area at a time. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope that in the near future there will be a special committee on education and the arts.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 145, 160, 165 and 272 together.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work leading to the construction of a new stadium at Lansdowne Road is already under way. Since the Government&rsquo;s decision of 27 January to support a joint IRFU-FAI proposal <Col N="567"/>to redevelop Lansdowne Road stadium as a 50,000 all seated stadium, my Department has been in regular contact with both the IRFU and the FAI to plan for project implementation.</P>
    <P>A steering group has been established to advance the project. Chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, its membership comprises representatives of the IRFU, FAI, my Department and the OPW. Its first formal meeting was held on 23 February with two subsequent meetings held in March. A priority for the steering group is to ensure that all the legal, financial, planning and procurement requirements are met in an efficient and timely manner so actual construction work can get under way at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The construction phase is expected to take 29 months and is scheduled to commence in 2006 and to be completed by the end of 2008. The delivery of the project will be the joint responsibility of the IRFU and the FAI which have approved the establishment of a special purpose vehicle to this end. Discussions on the text of a formal grant agreement between my Department on the one hand and the IRFU and FAI on the other are well advanced and I expect them to reach finality in the coming weeks.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the steering group is up and running, which leads to my next question. How often will the group report back to the Minister and how often will he report to the House on the group&rsquo;s findings? Will there be a half-yearly report on progress? How quickly will any delays be pinpointed? Is there an envelope of funding guaranteed over the period or will subsequent budgets affect the process? Is the funding ring-fenced?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The steering group, under the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Furlong, will report to me on a very regular basis. Mr. Furlong already reports to me on a regular basis about the ongoing work on the new stadium. Obviously whenever I am required by Members to answer questions about the stadium I will be only too pleased to do so. We have Question Time once a month and I will be quite happy to answer any questions which come up or which are submitted to me in writing.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the time frame for the work seeks the completion of the stadium during 2008. It was anticipated that the special purpose vehicle would be established in 2004 and I have explained that that has been done. We are then to have the appointment of a project leader, project managers and design team, all engaged by the special purpose vehicle. In 2005 I anticipate that the developed scheme will be prepared and the planning application lodged and I anticipate that in 2006 planning permission will be secured, with detailed design prepared and the tender for the work opened. I hope work on construction <Col N="568"/>commences around July 2006 and continues that year and through 2007, with the project being completed in 2008.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to securing planning permission in 2006. Would it be possible to begin negotiations with the local residents to discuss planning concerns? That is what usually delays planning permission. Planning permission can be secured in a matter of months once the design is completed, but that is only if people&rsquo;s concerns are taken on board. The project team should do its best to facilitate everyone. That is very important and those negotiations should begin immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The IRFU has been extremely responsible on this matter, as it has been on everything relating to the stadium. It has already met residents of the Lansdowne Road area to discuss the proposals and obviously an application such as this will be subject to the rigours of the planning process in the same way as any other application. There are no guarantees I can give about objections. All I can say is I hope we can keep to or improve upon the time frame I envisage. However, I do not want to give rise to any false hopes and therefore I have consistently stated that it is my ambition that the stadium would be completed during 2008. I hope this time frame can be adhered to and I am confident that will be the case, but the project will have to go through the planning process in the normal way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the huge implications for the Exchequer of losing international matches in soccer and rugby, has any thought been given to alternative venues for international matches? Has there been any contact between the Minister and the two organisations involved, the IRFU and the FAI, on how this is to be overcome? Surely now is the time to start talking to overcome the problem rather than reaching construction stage in 2006 while still wondering if this massive loss to the Exchequer will occur. I know we have a limited choice of venues but now is the time to address this. The Minister will have my support, my party&rsquo;s support and the support of every Member in trying to overcome this problem, but now is the time to start negotiations on it. What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on this issue?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I omitted to reply to one of Deputy Gogarty&rsquo;s questions. A financial envelope has been put in place for this and the Government has agreed, at current prices, to put up &euro;191 million, with the remainder to be put up by the IRFU and FAI.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall mentioned a replacement venue while the new stadium is under construction, which is obviously a matter of great concern to me. The facts are that construction will take approximately 29 months and it is difficult to say for how long during construction the stadium will be closed completely. However, it is without <Col N="569"/>question that it will be closed completely and people will then ask where international games in particular will be played while Lansdowne Road is closed. I agree with Deputy Wall that that question has to be addressed between now and the anticipated commencement date in 2006.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply, to what extent will he undertake discussions and negotiations with the various sporting bodies likely to be affected in the event of the new stadium not being completed within the deadline? For example, to what extent will the Minister engage with the various sporting bodies to try to ensure that major games scheduled for Ireland in the intervening period will not have to be played outside the country? To what extent will he engage with all the sporting bodies in order to determine the options which will be available?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important that international games are not played outside the country at any point during the construction phase. It would be a great blow to the morale and prestige of sport in the country if that were to happen and I will engage in as much dialogue and discussion with the major sporting organisations as is humanly possible to see if we can bring about a resolution to that problem. As I say, we have some time within which we can do this, between now and the commencement date in 2006, but there should be no complacency. These fixtures must often be planned far in advance and in fairness to the sporting organisations, it is necessary that they have some indication of what is going to happen. I know they have given this matter some thought already and that the issue has been broached in discussions, though we have not gone into any great detail. Clearly the issue will have to be addressed in far greater detail in the near future.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
     <Quest>if adverse media reports concerning public drinking, especially among teenagers, in Dublin city centre on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day may be a deterrent to families and visitors enjoying the festivities; the effect such reports may have for the tourism industry during such a significant date in the calendar; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10644/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The organisation and promotion of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival is primarily a matter for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival Company, which secures substantial funding through F&aacute;ilte Ireland under my Department&rsquo;s Vote. The festival&rsquo;s reputation as a world famous event continues to grow. It attracts huge crowds and is extremely popular, not only with Irish people, who view it as a great source of pride, but also with overseas visitors. The parade generates very favourable international media coverage and it <Col N="570"/>traditionally signals the start of the tourist season. The organisers were generally very pleased with this year&rsquo;s events and considered them very successful. Regrettably, there were some negative media reports on teenage drinking, particularly late on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. However, the festival organisers are satisfied that no public order incidents occurred to spoil the parade or the other events organised throughout the week.</P>
    <P>Excessive drinking is a concern to us all and the Government has taken a very firm stance on this issue with the introduction last year of legislation. It is the primary objective of every festival or event organiser that visitors to their event, whether local or from overseas, have an enjoyable time. It is unfortunate, therefore, that incidents such as those referred to by the Deputy occurred, particularly as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival has developed a very good reputation as a family event over the past few years. I hope, therefore, that the scale of such incidents this year was exceptional and will not act as a deterrent to families who want to enjoy the festival atmosphere in the city centre in future years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in Dublin has gained huge significance in recent years. In rural areas there has been a fall-off in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events mainly due to a lack of insurance cover. This is regretted. Many from country areas travel to Dublin for the parade.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports of a group of under age people drinking did not give much confidence to the development of that aspect of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade. Has the Minister had meetings with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this aspect of the parade? Has he met the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade committee on the overall effect of the parade and the interest it has generated? I am aware from newspaper reports that Tourism Ireland had a number of representatives from the travel business and media from other countries here. Has a negative report been received from them on what occurred here?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not had too many negative reports on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival. We are all aware of reports of teenage drinking and thuggery. I marched in the London parade in the pouring rain with thousands of expatriate Irish people and others, and neither at that nor at the substantial concert afterwards was there any trouble whatsoever. It is, therefore, disconcerting to return home to find this kind of thuggish behaviour occurs here. Obviously, it is a cause of great concern and of embarrassment, and it is deeply regrettable. In the circumstances I will ask the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival committee to look at the entire question with a view to seeing whether suggestions can be made to improve the position. The festival committee did an exemplary job and is in no way at fault for the actions of a few who only served to smear a tremendous festival. I <Col N="571"/>sincerely hope the committee will be in a position to liaise with the relevant authorities with a view to minimising the possibility of a recurrence of this kind of behaviour on the streets.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister calls embarrassing behaviour happens all over the country at many festivals. Part of the solution is to give young people a choice of other things to do. A report heading to the Minister&rsquo;s desk shows the benefits of putting more money into sport and art as a deterrent to drink abuse, drugs and so on. Will the Minister commit to giving that report serious attention? Its 12 recommendations, if implemented, would solve the problem of under age drinking at festivals. This is a problem not only at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival but at festivals of all kinds throughout the summer and the entire year. The Minister&rsquo;s Department is one Department that can and should make a difference. Will he commit to giving the report, which will be on his desk in a few weeks&rsquo; time, serious consideration?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister acknowledge the media reports were based on fact, that under age drinking takes place at all major festivals and that it has nothing to do with the good work carried out by the festival committee but rather with Government incompetence, particularly, by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and by the lack of funding provided by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to the Minister&rsquo;s Department and to the Minister for Education and Science to encourage young people to get involved in sports and the arts? That is the nub of the issue. Will the Minister raise the matter in the strongest terms with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and stop him spouting off about more prison spaces, to stop the cause of anti-social behaviour and drinking?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us be clear about one thing, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I remember introducing legislation to deal with under age drinking, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has done the same. There is plenty of legislation. There are plenty of places where fellows can kick a ball around if they wish rather than running around the street half drunk.</P>
   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, made a series of major announcements. He promised 2,000 extra Garda, two new prisons and a land bridge, a gun amnesty and mandatory sentences for gun offences. I am not sure what tablets the Minister was taking but there was a clear commitment in the programme for Government to the appointment of 2,000 Garda, which was then abandoned and announced as such by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, partly on the basis of cost and partly on the basis that there was not a manpower problem in dealing with crime here.</P>
    <P>Is it not patently obvious that the credibility of the Government on matters of crime is in shreds and that the announcements made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, apparently off the top of his head, have no basis in terms of Government decision? Has the Government approved money for two extra prisons and a land bridge? When will legislation on gun amnesties be published? Why did the <Col N="573"/>Minister not consider it appropriate to take measures on gun amnesties when certain personnel roamed the streets in Limerick a few months ago, murdering and maiming each other? Why did the Minister not take gun offences seriously at that time? Why has he made seven pronouncements here about evidence he has of criminal gangs and organised crime? Why has he not sent in the CAB and why has the Government not provided resources to ensure prosecutions can be brought in these cases and that known criminals, and evidence known to the Minister and the Taoiseach, can be brought before the courts, punished and put out of business?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to bring in a Supplementary Estimate or is this just a whim of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, like some summertime Santa Claus, that he can appeal to the Minister for Finance, simply because he got an extra &euro;1 billion in his resources from receipts from offshore accounts? Has the Government approved the extra garda&iacute; and prison spaces and the finance for them? When will we see the legislation in respect of a gun amnesty? Why does the Minister not send in the Criminal Assets Bureau and pursue prosecutions in regard to organised crime about which he has evidence?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of resources, almost &euro;1 billion has been provided this year to tackle crime. The Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement of measures to tackle the increasing level of gun crime builds on the unprecedented level of criminal law reform engaged in by the Minister and the Government. The Minister has a number of Bills before the House, including the criminal justice Bill, which is before Cabinet and which deals with a range of relevant issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have demonstrated an unswerving commitment to tackling crime through increased Garda resources and a budget of almost &euro;1 billion. We have given the Garda new powers and introduced criminal justice reforms in regard to the courts and prisons. We have addressed the problem of public order head on with significant new legislation which is working well. As well as providing increased resources, we will also meet the challenge posed by gangland and gun crime with a firm resolve and a targeted, effective response, to which the Minister referred.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the money for that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The criminal justice Bill will be published during the Easter break. In addition to the substantial new Garda powers contained in it, the Minister proposes to examine the possibility of including new provisions, such as mandatory sentences for firearms offences to demonstrate the serious nature of such activity. He has also examined the current exemptions to the <Col N="574"/>mandatory ten-year sentence for drug offences to ensure greater application of that provision in the courts. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, brought in that provision, which has applied for a considerable number of years. It has worked effectively in most instances but case law shows that some matters need to be examined. The Minister also announced he will examine the possibility of introducing an amnesty whereby illegal firearms would be handed in to garda&iacute;, while not providing immunity for any crimes that might have been committed with them.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government commits it to completing a programme of modernising our prisons and providing extra places, and the Minister has made a number of announcements in this regard. A combination of factors, including an increasing population, increased committals to prison, the fact that prisoners are serving longer sentences and that the revolving door is gone, has led to a larger prison population requiring more prison accommodation, which is why the Minister has raised this issue.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister announced his decision to close the Mountjoy complex as soon as a suitable replacement prison had been built. There is general agreement on the need to replace the accommodation and facilities at Mountjoy as soon as possible. The prison has been subject to criticism from many quarters, including from the inspector of prisons and the committee for the prevention of torture. Some 28 offers of sites for the new prison are being examined by the OPW.</P>
    <P>Equally, the accommodation at Cork Prison has been subject to criticism and expressions of concern. The Minister has already expressed the view that there is a need for a new prison to serve the southern region. Yesterday, he took the opportunity when visiting Spike Island to examine the suitability of a location for a new purpose-built security prison. That issue will be examined further and taken forward by the Prison Service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government closed that prison two months ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Fort Mitchel place of detention on Spike Island closed temporarily due to a failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers Association on an agenda to eliminate the payment of overtime. Fort Mitchel will resume its role as a closed detention centre in the event that agreement is reached with the association.</P>

	<P>When will we see the 2,000 garda&iacute;?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Garda numbers, the Garda training facility has been operating at a maximum for some time and it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to keep it that way. The Minister has <Col N="575"/>indicated he will bring forward the proposal to try to continue the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the number of garda&iacute; over the lifetime of the Government. He is working on such proposals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach has not answered any of the questions I asked, let me remind him of them. Did the Government make a commitment to recruit 2,000 extra garda&iacute;? Did it subsequently announce that this programme was being abandoned? Is this announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a restoration of the original proposal or is it an example of how certain Members seem to be afflicted by the selective amnesia that has struck certain former and current Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers? Is it not the case that 105,000 crimes were committed in this country in 2002, and that there have been 11 murders to date this year, culminating in a savage murder in Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s constituency within the past week? Are our streets not more like those of Dodge City in 1880 than of Ireland in 2004?</P>
    <P>With regard to a gun amnesty, is it not a fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knows well, from the intelligence briefings he tells everybody about, who the perpetrators are, and that a gun amnesty would apply to known criminals in organised crime gangs? Why has he not sent in the CAB and why has the Government not sat on these people day and night until they are put out of business? Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed in his responsibility to deliver safe streets, stamp out crime and deliver on the programme for Government which the former Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, is telling the Taoiseach he brought in through his zero tolerance policy, which has also failed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my condolences to the family of Joan Casey in regard to the terrible murder at the weekend. I do not accept the picture painted by Deputy Kenny is true. Of course there is too much crime.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is not doing anything about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we have continued to strengthen our laws. The Government has built two new prisons. We have substantially increased Garda numbers, which are at an all time high. We have improved and strengthened the training facilities for garda&iacute;, which are at a maximum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are the extra garda&iacute;?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the lifetime of the Government, our policy is to continue to try to improve that number. We have set up numerous highly-trained, sophisticated and well-manned special units within the Garda to deal with this <Col N="576"/>issue. We have invested in reform of the prison system and resourcing the criminal justice system. There has been unprecedented criminal law reform. Acts passed in this and the previous D&aacute;il--&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not provided a single euro for an extra garda.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and legislation before the House, including the criminal justice Bill which is coming forward, are all significant in the fight against crime. However, we know we must keep up this fight as one cannot ease up on it. In recent days, the Minister has outlined his thinking on such issues, in preparation for the new criminal justice Bill which will be published during the Easter recess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are back in the promised land.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue said, on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that we could judge his zero tolerance policy after five years on the basis of whether people felt safer in their homes and on the streets. They do not feel very safe in my constituency &mdash; I suspect it is not very different from most constituencies in this city and elsewhere in the county &mdash; where a grandmother can be murdered in her own bedroom at 6.30 a.m. on a Saturday. That is the result of zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>To focus on the Tallaght Garda division, there are 163 garda&iacute; in the Tallaght area for 90,000 people. There are more than 400 garda&iacute; in Limerick, for example, for a lesser population. In 1997, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mrs. Nora Owen, and the then Garda Commissioner accorded divisional status to Tallaght, which would have brought extra manpower resources and vehicles. Seven years later, not one aspect has been implemented on the bogus pretext that there is not enough accommodation at Tallaght to house the new manpower resources and vehicles. While there are 163 garda&iacute;, the single Garda station is often manned by as few as half a dozen garda&iacute;.</P>
    <P>This is the reality on the ground while the Minister runs around the country making announcements, as the Taoiseach said. The Taoiseach is correct. The Minister makes announcements on everything under the sun. It would be a tremendous help if, one of these days, he could follow one of the announcements through to conclusion.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the figures. There have been 263 murders since 1998 and proceedings have been commenced in 123 or 47% of cases, which is less than half. There were four murders involving firearms in 1998, of which there were three reported detections. Last year there were 21, only seven of which have been detected. That is the reality of urban life. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform travels around the country making these announcements. Deputy <Col N="577"/>Kenny has already asked twice and I will ask for the third time. Will the Taoiseach say if the Minister, Deputy McDowell, had the approval of Cabinet to announce the recruitment of 2,000 garda&iacute; as he did last night? Did he have approval to announce the construction of two new prisons or is this just a repeat of the bogus promises made by the Taoiseach in advance of the 2002 general election when he promised 2,000 additional garda&iacute;, none of whom have been recruited since?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have already stated, An Agreed Programme for Government proposed that, over a five year period, the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be increased by 2,000. That is a commitment in the programme. The resources for this year means that we will move to an all-time high of 12,200. The facilities for training garda&iacute;, which have been modernised and updated, are full but further space will become available as trainees graduate.

	<P>Our garda&iacute; are highly thought of and highly trained in very good facilities. The Deputy&rsquo;s comments are ridiculous. We will continue to train as many as possible and the Minister is working on that.</P>
    <P>This Government has built two new prisons. The Minister outlined his proposals on prisons last year. He hopes to bring private investment into the construction of further prisons and this is the right course to take. The Minister has brought forward extensive legislation and this has proved to be very effective in the area of public order. Fifteen months ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>As I have already said in answer to Deputy Rabbitte, we all have our regrets about what happened to Mrs. Joan Casey and offer our condolences. However, does Deputy Rabbitte believe that every single criminal act can be stopped? It cannot be done. We have established highly sophisticated, motivated and well-trained specialist units and the Criminal Assets Bureau to assist in breaking these gangs. The reality is that it is not easy to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has failed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but we must continue trying to do that. Many of the warlords who ran these gangs are now serving long sentences. However, the benefits of drug-related crime attract other people and new gangs now operate in a number of areas. We must continue in our efforts to defeat and break them. That is why we are looking at the sentencing, especially where there are exemptions to the mandatory ten year rule. The only way to deal with these issues is by means of detection, arrest, conviction and the imposition of long sentences, and that is what the Minister is endeavouring to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach knows that, more than any other single factor, the bluff, bluster and windbaggery of the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, was responsible for him coming to office in May 2002. That same Minister said that we could judge him by whether the streets were safer and whether people felt safer in their homes. It is transparent that people do not feel safer in their homes nor in the streets and that is to understate it. The reality is that there have been 263 murders and proceedings against the perpetrators have not even been initiated in more than half of them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that a Garda strength of 12,000 will be an all-time high when it is achieved. He knew that when he made the promises in 2002. It was the Taoiseach, not just the Minister, Deputy McDowell, who said that he would recruit 2,000 extra garda&iacute;. It turned out that the Garda training college in Templemore could not oblige because it would take almost four years, but the Taoiseach made the commitment. The situation now is that the number of new garda&iacute; recruited since then less the number of retirees means 98 new garda&iacute; have been recruited and the Taoiseach stated that there would be 2,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, goes around making announcements. The Taoiseach says the Minister has brought legislation before the House. Where is it? He has promised and announced it. Unless the Taoiseach means the Bill on public order that was passed by the previous D&aacute;il and that has not made one whit of difference, where is this legislation? When will the Minister deal with the fact that people do not <Col N="579"/>feel safe walking the streets of Dublin and other cities because of the extent of gangland deaths? These people are ordinary, law-abiding citizens such as my constituent, Mrs. Joan Casey, who, despite that she was minding her own business was murdered in her bedroom in the early hours of Saturday morning. How is that acceptable? How can the Taoiseach continue to stand over a situation where 163 garda&iacute; police a community of 90,000 people? How can he say it is being done because there is not enough accommodation to house additional garda&iacute; in Tallaght?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 12,200 garda&iacute; in the State. A large number of specialist units in the State deal with gangland killings. We will continue to provide increased resources. This year &euro;1 billion has been invested in the criminal justice system and the Garda. We will continue to increase the number of prison places and to introduce legislation.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, closed two prisons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is well aware of the extent of the legislation which has come through the justice system. There has been much useful legislation dealing with public order.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked when the criminal justice Bill will come before the House. He will see it during the Easter recess and it will be before the House in the next session. I will not quote the figures on the reduction in crime because it makes no sense to do so. I know the death of Mrs. Casey upsets people, as do gangland murders. I am aware that people are upset and horrified when gangs murder innocent people, but we will continue to provide more resources and to introduce more stringent legislation to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment was to increase Garda numbers by 2,000 over the lifetime of the Government and we will continue to do that as resources permit. At any one time, about 500 garda&iacute; are being trained in Templemore and capacity has been dramatically increased in the past five to six years to allow for extra numbers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days press reports suggested that the Government was about to <Col N="580"/>agree that our national airline, Aer Lingus, would be put up for sale within a matter of months. Will the Taoiseach confirm if this is the case and if the sale of Aer Lingus has been under active discussion in Cabinet or is scheduled for such discussion? If the Government sells Aer Lingus, what form will the sale take and to whom will it be sold?</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that the national airline should go the same way as the national telecommunications industry, namely, into the hands of venture capitalists, speculators, a billionaire tax exile facilitated by the Government&rsquo;s legislation and the type of people who think that the cabin crew should hop out and push an aeroplane along the runway if it stalls to get it going again? All these people have milked the telecommunications industry of hundreds of millions of euro, resources which properly belong to the people and which could be invested in many of our starved public services rather than going into the coffers of bloated multinational corporations.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus made a profit of &euro;83 million last year. Anybody who used the service in recent times and saw the pressure workers are under to keep the company going will know from where the extra profit came. Is the Taoiseach aware that many people would regard it as outright treachery if the Government were to decide, in exactly the same manner as it sold our telecommunications industry, to sell the national airline of an island nation to faceless venturers and allow them to speculate with the company and its workers without democratic control?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The short answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s long question is that there is no proposal before the Government to sell Aer Lingus. I do not have anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He should tell that to his Minister for Transport.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All the answers to the other questions, therefore, fall. Twice in the past ten years, taxpayers&rsquo; resources had to be used to save Aer Lingus, because of many of the issues the Deputy mentioned. The company was not able to survive without injections of resources.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not the only airline in need of them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The trade union representatives, the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as well as SIPTU and IMPACT and the company worked hard to try to find a viability plan. The concern of the trade unions and workers now is whether, in the changed world of aviation, they can sustain all their achievements in the longer term without looking to the future and making plans. I know management and workers have that concern but there are no conclusions.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="581"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach be more specific on the Government&rsquo;s intention regarding the future of the national airline? It is not for nothing that he and his Minister for Transport orchestrated the passing of legislation facilitating the sale of a significant section of Aer Lingus to private venture capitalists. Does he remember how his Government burned 400,000 people, mostly small investors, when his former Minister for Public Enterprise engaged in every trick to con them into buying shares in Eircom? Admittedly the powers of recall of the former Minister in question, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, are much greater than the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, as we have seen in recent days. Surely, however, he cannot forget how ordinary people were burned while four executive directors of the company earned &euro;29 million in a brief two and a half year period. For good measure, they threw a few million euro in the direction of a tame trade union leader who inexplicably maintains his position as general secretary of the main union. Is this the future the Government has mapped out for Aer Lingus? The Taoiseach should not tell the House that no decision has been made. What is his intention, as the Prime Minister, with regard to Aer Lingus in the remainder of his Government&rsquo;s period of office?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever happens with Aer Lingus in the future, the Government will try to protect and maintain the jobs of all the ordinary people, as Deputy Joe Higgins describes them, who work in the company.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the people in Shannon Airport who have been told they must move to Dublin or lose their jobs?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As we know, aviation is extremely volatile. We have seen several airlines, including Olympic Airways, SAS and KLM, in trouble. At least we have an airline in which people may possibly invest to keep it expanding in future. Aer Lingus has gone through a period of overhaul but that matter is one for consideration in the future. As the Deputy knows, if the company gets into trouble again, the way is no longer open for taxpayers&rsquo; money to be invested in it. That is not an alternative that is open to us.</P>

	<P>It is open, that is a falsehood.</P>

   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following issue of urgent national importance, namely, the working of the agreement between the Department of Health and Children and the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with regard to the exclusive rights held by the hospital to all donor lungs from Ireland, and the fact that a person with cystic fibrosis who has already been selected for a lung transplant at Manchester Hospital cannot undergo this critical, life-saving procedure as a lung will not be released to him by the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the Government to launch an international initiative to expose the truth of collusion between successive British Governments and their surrogate Unionist paramilitary organisations in the killings of hundreds of people; the mandate given to the Government by the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on the Barron Report to initiate further investigations into the failure by agencies of the State to properly investigate the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974; and to press the British Government to establish a public inquiry into the role of its forces in that atrocity.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the need for the Government to become pro-active on the issue of collusion in response to the appeal of bereaved families and survivors of collusion who visited Leinster House on 25 March and were met by Deputies and Senators from all political parties, except the Labour and Progressive Democrats parties, and several Independent Deputies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the findings of the Cory report which clearly indicate that there was widespread collusion between the British Government and loyalist death squads in the killing of Irish citizens north and south of the Border over the past 30 years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the latest comments by Judge Peter Cory in which he acknowledges that the British Government has failed to live up to the clear commitments it made at Weston Park to launch a public inquiry into the death of Belfast solicitor, Pat Finucane, if that was the recommendation of his report.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 8, Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003 &mdash; Financial Resolution; No. 13, Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages, to adjourn at 7 p.m., if not previously concluded; No. 14, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; No. 8 shall be decided without debate; and Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 35, Motion re Paramilitary Activities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals before the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8 without debate agreed to?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial resolution in question will, for the first time, vest in the Minister for Finance and the new recruitment process the power to charge fees to people who apply for public service jobs. This provision was not made known in the course of debate to date on the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill. The resolution provides for the introduction of another form of stealth tax.</P>
    <P>As Committee Stage of the Bill will not be debated until tomorrow in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, there has not been an opportunity to discuss this proposal or obtain information about the level and range of fees the Government clearly intends to introduce. The introduction of this measure without debate is, therefore, inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Charging fees to make public service job applications is a major change. What will be the effect on poorer people or young people from <Col N="584"/>disadvantaged backgrounds who apply for Civil Service jobs? We do not know the range of the proposed fees, which amount to another stealth tax, and the House will not have an opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the proposal is in the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach defer the financial resolution until the Committee on Finance and the Public Service has had an opportunity to hear the Government&rsquo;s proposals from the Minister?</P>

   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When can we expect to see legislation before the House on the gun amnesty? When will we see legislation dealing with the successor to the health boards. It appears that health board staff are confused about who their employer will be on 1 July given that the Minister for Health and Children will assume responsibility for the acquisition and legal disposal of assets held by health boards. Will this be addressed before the changeover date?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, the criminal justice Bill will be published either during or just after the Easter recess. I do not know if it will contain the proposal referred to but the Minister will make the final decisions on it.</P>
    <P>The health board legislation has been cleared by the Government and will be circulated within days, probably next week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, or know if <Col N="586"/>he was speaking for the Government when he said it was desirable that the referendum on citizenship be decoupled from an election environment? When will the relevant Bill be published and when is it likely to come before the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should reply on legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be published within the next few days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>My party leader asked a specific question on when the legislation will come before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will have to be discussed with the Whips but the Government would like to see it before the House at an early date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill we are being asked about most frequently is the disability Bill, which is on the pink pages. Will it be rights-based? Will the <Col N="587"/>Taoiseach indicate on what date it will be published?</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach is asked about the prison services Bill regularly, but he might have news on it. Is this not a case of the cart coming before the horse in light of the announcements on prisons? Should we not have legislation before we have announcements on changes to our prison infrastructure? Likewise, will the critical infrastructure (Dublin metro) Bill will be preceded by an announcement on the metro?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not necessary to make any comments on the Bills.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is on the same subject raised by Deputy Sargent. I want further clarification on whether the delay in taking Report Stage of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill is in some way an attempt to delay the disability Bill? At one stage the Minister for Education and Science said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise at this stage. I suggest that the Deputy submit a question to the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he would complete the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill before taking the disability Bill. Will the Taoiseach clarify that he will not wait for one to be passed before he publishes the other?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to that question is: &ldquo;Definitely not&rdquo;. We are trying to pass the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill as soon as we can.</P>
    <P>On the prison services Bill, it is not possible to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the disability Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to answer the questions, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me about the prison services Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should address the disability Bill first.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter what order they are taken in once the Deputy&rsquo;s questions are answered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are helping the Taoiseach with his recall.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very good, actually. It is hoped that we can complete the disability Bill as soon as possible. As I said previously, there has been a great deal of discussion on the Bill. Almost 50 officials from Departments and the <Col N="588"/>Office of the Attorney General have been trying to deal with it. The comhairle (amendment) Bill and the sectoral proposals must also be considered. On the basis of many of the comments we received, there is still some work to be done on the disability Bill even though we have done considerable work on it. It has nothing to do with the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate the date on which the prison services Bill will be published.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the need to build extra prisons, is any effort being made to introduce the fines Bill which will prevent people being put in jail who do not necessarily need to be put there?</P>
    <P>Earlier today, we met the Immigrant Council of Ireland, which was established by this House and to be funded by the State, yet no funds are now being made available to it. In light of that, when will the immigration and residence Bill come before the House so we can have a full discussion on the funding of that organisation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft scheme of the fines Bill to provide for updating legislation on fines and related matters was circulated to various Departments and views have been received and are being examined. Work on the heads of the immigration and residence Bill is ongoing but has been delayed by work on other immigration legislation matters and this includes consideration of submissions received as part of the public consultation process on immigration and the International Organisation for Migrant study of migrant legislation and practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the package of proposals from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and specifically, the gun amnesty, does the Taoiseach propose that General de Chastelain will oversee decommissioning there? In the context of the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill, given that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has proposed another 2,000 garda&iacute;, but Templemore does not have the capacity, will the Taoiseach consider locating a Garda academy on the Grangegorman site?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy submits a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The first matter relates to criminal justice legislation but one does not need a legislative measure for the amnesty. The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill is being drafted and will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will legislation be brought forward to establish an inquiry with wider terms of reference or will a motion be tabled in the House?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not finished; I have a number of other questions on promised legislation.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Government&rsquo;s list of promised Bills to be concluded before the end of the spring term. On 25 January, the Government published 25 Bills of which I can only see six that have been dealt with in the session. Where stands the Health (Amendment) Bill to allow for the removal of councillors from health boards in advance of the local elections? When will that be addressed given that we have a limited period of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That has been dealt with today in response to Deputy Kenny.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the lead up to the local elections on 11 June?</P>
    <P>What is the position of the health Bill, number 76 on the list, to establish the executive itself? Given the continuing toll of avoidable, accidental <Col N="590"/>deaths of workers, especially in the construction industry, when will we see the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the Neary case, the Minister for Health and Children is in consultation with the families and representatives on the issue and discussions took place yesterday. There is continuing contact between them. The Minister has listened to the points made. There will not necessarily be legislation in that area but that matter is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I already responded to Deputy Kenny in regard to the Health (Amendment) Bill and said it would be published in a matter of days. The health Bill is a large one and it is being drafted but, as I pointed out recently, it will take some time. The Safety, Heath and Welfare at Work Bill will be published before the beginning of the summer session.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was encompassed in that comprehensive trawl by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. The Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Bill has been promised three times and the date has moved. Given the commitments made to large groups of workers concerned about the ongoing carnage on building sites outside this House, when will the Bill be enacted, or at least, be presented?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am told it will be presented at the end of April.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I to understand the Taoiseach will not be present in the House tomorrow? I know arrangements have been made for the Taoiseach to give his evidence at the tribunal. I understand that evidence is simple. Am I to understand he must meet the legal team in the morning? Does he intend to be present for the Order of Business tomorrow morning?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on the arrangements. I was to discuss all these matters with the legal team at the weekend but we did not do that for other reasons. I assume I will have to do that in the morning but I will need to see what time I am scheduled to be on tomorrow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case, it means the Taoiseach will not be back here until 27 April. If his memory is as sharp as it appears and the answer is &ldquo;No, I was not there&rdquo;, why does he have to meet a legal team? Can he still not find time to be here for the Order of Business?</P>

In order to hold the referendum on 11 June to run with the local and European Parliament elections, which would be highly reckless and irresponsible, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention that the D&aacute;il should return the week beginning 19 April to deal with this or other legislation?</P>

	<P>The question has already been dealt with. I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a question that is absolutely in order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question was asked earlier and was answered by the Taoiseach. We have repetition.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No. I asked if it was the intention of the Government bring the D&aacute;il back the week beginning 19 April to deal with this or other legislation? That is absolutely in order and I would like the Taoiseach to answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach answered that question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will repeat what I stated earlier. I said the Government will publish the Bill in the next few days and that it wants to take the Bill as soon as the Whips can arrange it. We will need to do so quickly, and probably the week after next.</P>

	<P>Deputy Higgins, allow Deputy Rabbitte to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, maybe this question is for you. Two weeks ago I suggested to the Taoiseach that the House was coming back early to take the citizenship Bill but he seemed to deny it. He has misled Deputy Kenny who thought we were coming back on 27 April. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform clearly thinks this is a matter for smug satisfaction that a party which espouses republicanism in Killarney is to utilise an election environment to stir up the type of antipathy we saw at the last election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must confine himself to a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I take it, a Cheann Comhairle, that if the Taoiseach does not answer the question, you will answer it? Is the House being convened a week earlier than advised to the Whips at the beginning of the year? If the Taoiseach will not be here tomorrow, will he at least tell the House why it is being reconvened a week earlier and what the business will be? He must stop playing ducks and drakes with us on this side of the House. I am sick and tired of the prevarication, ducking and weaving and dishonesty from the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, on the matter. Is the Taoiseach taking the bloody Bill a week early or is he not?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the Chair, it is a matter for the House on Thursday when we adjourn for the Easter recess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Ceann Comhairle been approached?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already answered the question. There are procedures for dealing with the issue. I was asked if the Government will publish the Bill and I said it will do so in the next few days. I was asked if it will take the Bill early <Col N="593"/>and I said it will. I also said we would discuss the matter with the Whip, which is the normal way to do business. As has already been said, if we wish to deal with the Bill properly on 11 June, we must provide time for a debate at an early stage. We will go through the normal procedures before doing so.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputies Higgins and Rabbitte, I do not accept that reasonable and practical constitutional and legislative proposals designed to bring the immigration and citizenship laws into line with our European partners can be termed difficult or racist &mdash; it is not.</P>

	<P>What about the North of Ireland?</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will fundamentally change the significant issues we have been managing fairly well across all parties in recent years, and which are creating huge problems in other countries. We have managed to deal with the issues in this country. I do not believe that an extremely reasonable proposal will be transformed into any kind of racist proposal purely by dealing with the matter on the same day as an election. It is not a complex, difficult or divisive issue. This will only be the case if people purport to try to do that. I certainly will not do so, and I urge others not do so.</P>

	<P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about four Bills promised in the past week by the Minister for Transport. I cannot find any of them on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme so perhaps the Taoiseach might tell us the titles of the Bills and when we can expect to see them.</P>
    <P>The first Bill will provide for random breath testing, while the second will provide for the inclusion of the use of mobile telephones in the penalty points system. The third Bill will allow for the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that his advice is that new <Col N="598"/>legislation is needed for that and the Minister for Transport has said he will go ahead with it before the summer. Finally, when will we see the legislation that has been promised to deal with court challenges to notices sent out under the penalty points system? It seems that prosecutions in regard to a large number of offences are in jeopardy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) This Act and the Air Navigation and Transport Acts 1936 to 1990 may be cited as the Air Navigation and Transport Acts 1936 to 2004 and shall be read together as one.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I am disappointed, in light of discussions on Committee Stage last week, that the Minister for Transport has not considered any of the points made. He gave us to understand that he would examine them and, if necessary, table his own amendments. I was disappointed to see that he had no amendments on the list that was circulated today. To what extent is he not correcting the technical problems with this Bill that were pointed out on Committee Stage because he does not want the inconvenience of the Bill being referred back to the Seanad?</P>
    <P>He indicated on Committee Stage that the Opposition made valid points and that he would correct the omissions in this Bill in a future eurozone Bill. That is bad practice. We should deal with each Bill on its merits to ensure it is as good as possible. That is the purpose of Committee Stage. It is bad practice not to deal with an obvious mistake or omission. It means an extra few hours and it would not be difficult to get the Seanad to schedule this Bill again.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have been big enough to admit there were minor difficulties that should have been corrected. I have suggested that in page 3, between lines 15 and 16, we would correct a technical omission by inserting a collective <Col N="601"/>citation with the existing Air Navigation Acts. We should amend the Bill along these lines.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s comments. When the Opposition takes the time and makes the effort to draft amendments to Bills and table them on Committee Stage, and the Minister gives a commitment to return with amendments on Report Stage, it is disingenuous of him not to do so and to refer to addressing the issues in a further Bill purely to avoid going back to the Seanad in respect of the amendments.</P>
    <P>This type of procedure normally occurs in the Upper House when it is dealing with a Bill and the Minister is not prepared to come back to this House with amendments. We are supposed to be legislators. We are supposed to be examining the legislation on all sides of the House and, where reasonable amendments are tabled, the Minister should take note of them. We all want to facilitate the legislation and have it passed by 1 May, and it can be done within the time available.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s technical amendment, which I hope the Minister of State can accept.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport regrets that he is unable to be in the House this afternoon due to the European Presidency meeting which is taking place today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Michael Schumacher is giving him driving lessons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>If Mr. Shumacher were giving driving lessons, I am sure Deputy Naughten would be there too.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by both Deputies. However, the urgency of concluding the Bill before the Easter recess is so that Ireland will be in a position with the other EU member states to ratify the Montreal convention before the end of April in order that it will be part of European law before the enlargement of the Union on 1 May. The Bill has been through the Seanad and if amendments are made in the D&aacute;il it will be necessary, as Deputies are aware, to take it back to the Seanad. Therefore, the Bill would not be finalised before Easter.</P>
    <P>I can deal with several of the issues raised without the need to incorporate changes in the text which was passed by the Seanad. In any case, I understand the Minister has already stated that a similar short Bill to give effect to the 1997 Euro-control revised convention will come before the Oireachtas later this year and will provide an opportunity to deal with remaining issues without delaying this Bill. I hope that is acceptable to both Opposition spokespersons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State and the Minister for Transport have accepted that we have a point and that these technical amendments <Col N="602"/>are required but, purely for reasons of time, he is not prepared to concede to them. Everyone on this side of the House has been more than co-operative on this Bill in spite of the fact that the Government has had a number of years in which to bring it forward. We are dealing with it at the last minute but, as the Minister of State knows perfectly well, there would still be time this week &mdash; the Bill could go to the Seanad tomorrow and be wrapped up.</P>
    <P>It is bad practice to accept that there are faults in a Bill and still allow it to be passed. It is not the right way to handle legislation and I appeal to the Minister of State to consider accepting these amendments and bringing the Bill before the Seanad tomorrow. We could still operate to the same time scale and we are more than happy to facilitate that. I do not believe the deadline is that tight and if something of a technical nature needs to be changed, it can surely be done in the week after Easter week, since we will be here to deal with the immigration Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s assertion that time is available. The Opposition has facilitated the Government in dealing with this legislation and has not caused undue delay. However, the difficulty is that the Government has dragged its heels in bringing forward this Bill and is now putting a gun to the Opposition&rsquo;s head saying that it needs to have the Bill through by 1 May and asking if the Opposition will facilitate it. However, when reasoned amendments are tabled, the Minister and his Department are not prepared to accept them because they do not want to go through the rigmarole of going back to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We can give the Minister a commitment that our colleagues in the Seanad will facilitate the swift passage of these amendments in the House before the end of the week to ensure the legislation meets its target.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that a further Bill is proposed for later this year. Will he clarify what the Minister for Transport stated? Will the legislation come forward later this year or in the autumn? There is a tendency for the Government to state that legislation is to come forward at a certain season in the year, for example, in the spring, summer or autumn, but we are not told in which year. That was typified in the House on the Order of Business in respect of the Rail Safety Bill which went through Committee Stage 12 months ago and was to be passed in the spring, yet the Taoiseach is now talking about the summer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>With the Easter recess, it would not be possible from a time point of view to go back to the Seanad, come back to the D&aacute;il and have the Bill signed by the Minister and the President. If major issues were involved, there is no question but that every effort would be made. However, that is not the case and the technical matters can be dealt with in the 1997 Euro-control Bill which <Col N="603"/>will come before the House later this year &mdash; the Deputy can take it that will be in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendment is that it would clarify that the Air Navigation and Transport Bill would be read together with the previous Air Navigation and Transport Acts. While it is a normal feature of Irish legislation that Acts may be grouped together as a series, it is not a requirement that they be so grouped, nor does it affect the validity of any part of the Act or Acts in question if they are not grouped together. However, in this case, the parliamentary counsel has advised that it would not be appropriate to group this Bill with the other Air Navigation Acts. This is because this Bill consolidates the law concerning the Warsaw and Montreal conventions.</P>
    <P>The law referred to in the 1929 Warsaw convention is currently included in Part 3 and the First Schedule of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936. These are repealed in section 11 of the Bill. The text of the 1929 convention is reproduced in the First Schedule of the Bill. The 1955 and 1975 amendments to the Warsaw convention were enacted in the Air Navigation and Transport Acts of 1959 and 1988. The text of the Warsaw convention incorporating these amendments is reproduced in the Second Schedule of the Bill. Consequently it is not possible to link this Bill to any other air navigation Acts and, on this basis, I am sure the House will agree the proposed amendment is unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;4.&mdash;Every Order under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next twenty one days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes in page 4 to insert a new section to safeguard the rights of this House in respect of ministerial orders. In three places in this Bill, provision is made for the Minister to make orders on one matter or another. The standard practice is that where ministerial orders are made, they are laid before the Houses. However, that is not provided for in this legislation. I propose that we amend the Bill to state that every order under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that <Col N="604"/>House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the normal convention be adhered to, whereby orders made by a Minister are laid before the Houses so that Members, particularly Opposition Members, have an opportunity to consider the orders and object to them, if appropriate. This is good practice and this provision should have been included in the original Bill. I ask the Minister of State to consider including it now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment would oblige the Minister to lay any order made under this Act before both Houses of the Oireachtas and give the House an opportunity to nullify those orders. The Bill envisages the Government making orders in three places, in sections 6(1) and 6(2) and in section 9. Both orders envisaged under section 6 are for the purpose of noting the current situation under the Montreal convention. An order under section 6(1) is for the purpose of formally listing the countries and territories to which the convention applies and an order under section 6(2) is for the purpose of formally noting changes to the monetary amounts under the convention.</P>
    <P>Unlike the much earlier Warsaw convention, the Montreal convention includes a mechanism for adjusting those amounts to take account of inflation. If a majority of the states that are parties to the Montreal convention do not object to the changed amounts the higher figures will apply to all states that have ratified the convention. There is no provision in the convention for any single state to opt out of those changes. It is not appropriate for the Oireachtas to annul an order made under either of these subsections. The annulment would have no effect, either on the list of states that are parties to the convention or on the monetary amounts applicable within the convention.</P>
    <P>An order under section 9 is for the purpose of extending the application of the convention to internal flights as well as to international flights. I accept, in principle, that this is an issue on which it would be legitimate for the Oireachtas to express its opinion. However, in practice most of the provisions of the convention, including the liability limits, are already applied to all EU airlines under EU Regulation No. 2027 of 1997 and Regulation No. 889 of 2002, and consequently apply to internal flights. Therefore, the need for making the order will not arise. In the circumstances I have outlined, I hope the House will accept that this amendment is not necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This, again, is a case of the Minister of State not wanting to delay matters, while conceding that I have a point. The established practice regarding ministerial orders has served us well and should be maintained. It <Col N="605"/>is bad practice to omit the requirement to lay orders before the House from legislation.</P>
    <P>In the two earlier subsections the orders would not be of any consequence. Nevertheless, good practice should be adhered to. The fact that no one will ever challenge the order is beside the point. However, the provision is particularly necessary in respect of section 9.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is attempting to justify weak drafting. He is trying to deal with the Bill as quickly as possible and is not prepared to accept the delay which referral of the Bill to the Seanad would entail. These amendments were tabled two weeks ago, giving sufficient time to schedule debate of the Bill in the D&aacute;il and Seanad. I accept that these are minor technical amendments. However, where technical errors and omissions are identified the Minister of State should accept that fact and facilitate correction, even if it involves a delay of a day or two. We might as well close down the Oireachtas if the Opposition may not have an input in the formation of legislation, particularly when it is of a technical nature.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall has raised a valid point. If the position of the Minister of State were applied generally to legislation, the standard provision regarding ministerial orders would never be included in legislation, because such orders are challenged extremely rarely. On that basis, there would be no point in ever making such a provision.</P>
    <P>Reference to ministerial orders should be included in the Bill. The Opposition has facilitated the Minister in bringing forward this legislation. Members on this side of the House have examined the Bill and drafted amendments to it. Although this amendment is technical in nature, it can be agreed by both sides. It is not being accepted, purely for procedural reasons. When Opposition Members are prepared to facilitate the Government in passing legislation, it is disappointing that our amendments, which clarify the legislation and ensure the enactment of the Bill, are treated in this way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s point is taken. However, there is a time factor of more than just one day. The amendment regarding the orders under section 9 will be looked at favourably in the Bill to be introduced later this year. I hope that will be a fair compromise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is bad practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, line 9, after &ldquo;1975&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and a copy of the said French text shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister as soon as may be after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P><Col N="606"/>
    <P FLI="0">In the case of an inconsistency between the English and French texts of the Bill, section 5 provides that the French text shall prevail. The section contains the most ridiculous sentence I have ever seen in legislation. It states: &ldquo;The French texts of those provisions are deposited in the Archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland, as provided for in the Warsaw Convention and in that Convention as amended by Protocol No. 4 of Montreal, 1975.&rdquo; I would not like to be in a hurry to get my hands on the French text, if it is buried somewhere in the depths of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Poland. This is ridiculous drafting. The French text should either have been attached to the Bill as a Schedule or laid before the Houses. In either case, the chosen option should be stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I raised this point with the Minister for Transport on Committee Stage, I was told that he had placed a copy of the French text in the Oireachtas Library. However, this will not be clear to a person reading this legislation in ten years&rsquo; time. If the legislation can state that the French text is deposited in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Poland, why can it not state it is available in the Oireachtas Library? Would that not be more sensible? A more common practice would be to attach the French text as a Schedule to the Bill.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>To state in the body of the Bill that it is in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Poland is ridiculous and unacceptable. That should be dealt with. The Minister seemed to accept that the complaints I made on Committee Stage were valid. Unfortunately, however, he has not seen fit to improve the Bill along the lines suggested and to make it sensible rather than ridiculous as it is at present.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s amendment. A huge mistake was made when drafting this Bill in that the French text was not attached as a Schedule. It should have been attached as a Schedule when it took precedence over the legislation we passed. I do not know if Deputy Shortall is fluent in French, but I am not. The Department made a big mistake when drafting this Bill by not furnishing to Members or attaching as a Schedule the original text which will supersede any other text attached to the Bill. The parliamentary counsel should have included it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his Second Stage speech that the Bill was consumer orientated. He said it would make it easier for members of the public to take a case against an airline if they were involved in an accident or looking for compensation. However, if there is a dispute about the translation, one must go to Poland to find out what the French text states. Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s amendment clarifies that and tries to rectify the mistake of not attaching the French <Col N="607"/>text to the Schedule when it supersedes the current text of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see a major problem for the electorate of County Roscommon. There are different types of technical issues. These are historic documents which will not be changed in the future. The amendment would require the Minister to lay a copy of the French text of the Warsaw convention before the Oireachtas. That would be unprecedented. The French text of these conventions is available on the website of the International Civil Aviation Authority.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister not state that in the Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister said, a copy of the documents will be placed in the Oireachtas Library. These are historic documents which will not be changed in the future. The Deputies should be sensible and accept that it is unnecessary to include the proposed amendment in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, this is not the first time I have dealt with an international convention. I have dealt with such conventions from a number of Departments. It is almost taken for granted that when conventions come before the House we on this side of the House will rubber-stamp them. The international convention is signed and we cannot undo that. However, Departments and Ministers can sometimes learn something from what is introduced in the House. When the Minister replied on Second Stage, he complimented some of the Opposition speeches. In many cases Ministers who signed international conventions on behalf of this country changed their opinion about them as a result of what was discussed here. A Schedule should be attached to legislation which is superseded by a text lodged in the Library or wherever. That is standard practice. The Schedule is always attached to legislation dealing with EU or international agreements. That clarifies queries which may arise.</P>
    <P>It may be the case that no one from Roscommon will raise questions. However, we do not know that for certain. People from Galway may be involved in an incident at some stage in the future where they or their families may have to make a compensation claim against an operator. If this legislation had been in place prior to the incident on 11 September, the one Irish family involved could have taken a case in Ireland. However, it could not do that because the legislation had not been enacted. It is relevant in this country, although I hope we do not have to use it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Warsaw convention only came into being in November of that year so it is irrelevant as regards 11 September. There has not <Col N="608"/>been a dispute between the French and English texts in the 75 year history of the Warsaw convention. I cannot believe this is an issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the point. The point is about the daft drafting, not about disputes between the English and French versions. The Minister should be straightforward about it. Where the French text prevails, a copy of it should either be attached or laid in the Oireachtas Library. It would be better if the Bill did not refer to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Poland. By including that in a section of the Bill we are indicating that is the only place one can get it. At some point in the future, in the event of a serious incident, people will want to know where they can get it. According to the legislation, the place it can be got is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Poland. It is ridiculous to have that in the Bill. The drafters of the Bill should have done the sensible and practical thing of either putting it in the Library or attaching it. It would have made the Bill more sensible.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 4. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are cognate. Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 may be taken together by agreement. The Deputy may move only amendment No. 4, but she may speak to the three amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, line 10, to delete &ldquo;notified in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This represents more weak drafting. It relates to the making of orders and notifying those in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>. The standard practice under the Statutory Instruments Acts is that orders are made and automatically published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>. There is no need to include in the legislation reference to publishing them in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>. The fact that it is referred to indicates that the purpose is to bypass the Statutory Instruments Acts and publish them in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>. Is that the intention?</P>
    <P>I hope it is not but the Bill, as drafted, indicates that it is. Normal practice under the Statutory Instruments Acts is that it happens automatically. Therefore, suspicions are raised if there is explicit reference to publishing it where that is not required. For that reason I propose to delete the <Col N="609"/>words &ldquo;notified in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>&rdquo; in the three sections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the subsection that orders must be printed and published as well as being noted in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>. The provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act will apply to orders made under the Bill. There is no intention to short circuit these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act was introduced by the 1955 amendment and reads as follows:</P>
    <P LI="2">(1) The following provisions shall apply in respect of every statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) within seven days after the making thereof, a copy thereof shall be sent to each of the following, namely, the National Library of Ireland, the Law Library, Four Courts, Dublin, the King&rsquo;s Inns Library, Dublin, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Cork Chamber of Commerce, the Limerick Chamber of Commerce, the Waterford Chamber of Commerce, the Galway Chamber of Commerce and the Southern Law Association, Cork,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) as soon as may be after it is made, notice of the making thereof and of the place where copies thereof may be obtained shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) on and from the date of the issue of the <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> containing the notice, copies of the statutory instrument shall be kept at the place specified in the notice and may be obtained there,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) as soon as may be after it is made, it shall, notwithstanding that it is liable to be annulled, be printed under the superintendence of the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The words &ldquo;notified in<i> Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>&rdquo;, in effect, repeat the provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act. However, they do not lessen the applicability of the legislation. Any orders made under the Bill will be published in the normal way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Then what is the purpose of the reference?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept the amendment because of the urgent need to enact the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the purpose of the reference?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to get clarification on that. The Minister will introduce another Bill later this year in which amendments will be included. The concerns expressed by Deputy Shortall will be looked at again at that time. As <Col N="610"/>most of the provisions of the Montreal Convention already apply to European airlines wherever they operate, there is no obvious need to make an order under section 9 to apply the convention to international flights.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Dealing with legislation in this manner is bringing the House into disrepute. There are a number of technical problems with this Bill. They are minor but they are still problems. The Minister of State and the Minister have accepted the need to amend the Bill. However, they are saying they will not do so now. They will proceed with a flawed Bill even though they are aware of the flaws, as they have conceded on a number of occasions. That is bad practice. It also brings the House into disrepute. It means today&rsquo;s debate and the debate on Committee Stage last week are rendered meaningless by the Minister. We were just going through the motions of having the different Stages even though the Minister had no intention of considering amendments.</P>
    <P>It would be one thing if the Minister told Members that there was no basis for the amendments. However, on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage he said the amendments were necessary, that the Bill was flawed and needed to be amended but that it would not be amended now but in a forthcoming Bill. If that is not making fools of all of us, I do not know what is. I reject the approach the Minister has taken with this Bill. He has been highly irresponsible in doing so. The problems should have been dealt with when there was ample time. When I tabled these technical amendments two weeks ago, there was time to deal with them in this House and to refer them to the Seanad. The Minister is bringing the House into disrepute by rushing the Bill through like this and is, in effect, giving us the fingers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>If there was any significance in the changes being proposed, there might be a case for dealing with the issue, notwithstanding the time constraints involved. However, they are of a technical nature and make no material difference to the Bill. The Deputy has been given an assurance that the technical changes that are necessary will be made later in the year. Given the fact that they are of a minor, technical nature, it is not important to make the changes now. It would necessitate a delay in the Bill and leave Ireland unable to ratify the convention before 1 May.</P>
    <P>The necessary technical changes will be made in the Bill to be introduced later this year. If it was a major issue or if they made any material difference in the text, there would not be a problem but that is not the case.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When the debate was adjourned last Thursday, I was speaking about the need to address the question of secrecy within the electronic system, particularly as it relates to the source code. There are a number of areas in which the secrecy of the ballot and the confidence that people can have in our voting system are exposed by this system and the legislation the Government is attempting to foist upon the House.</P>
    <P>The source code is probably the most important issue. The source code represents the electronic DNA of what a computer programme does and how it does it. If openly available, it is possible to scrutinise if it does properly what it is meant to do. The fact that the Government has chosen to allow a commercial firm to retain the copyright of this source code, a firm which operates outside this jurisdiction, on the basis that the code is a trade secret does nothing to add to confidence in this form of voting. This is in marked contrast to the approach taken in the Australian capital of Canberra. Its electoral commission produced a source code, at far less cost than the Government has managed, but has made that source code open source, which means copyright is vested in the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Commission, not the hands of a private company. This was done according to the electoral commission to ensure appropriate transparency, a term that does not find resonance with the Government but it is important to indicate this as it is something voters would like to see attached to a process which involves the casting of their votes in future elections. It is unfortunate the Government has taken this proprietary approach which allows the vendor of the system, Nedap, to hold onto its copyright of the source code which as of now is not available for proper scrutiny for possible flaws.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the second area involved &mdash; secrecy for those voters who wish to abstain, particularly in multiple elections. The Government wants the first widespread use of the electronic voting system on 11 June, the day of the local and European elections. We heard on the Order of Business today a poorly thought-out proposal for a constitutional referendum which will only complicate the introduction of a new voting system. It means voters will have four ballot papers on the screen and the Government does not seem to realise the extent to which this will affect people&rsquo;s right to abstain, not just from the voting process &mdash; the natural right to abstain to register an objection to what they see wrong <Col N="612"/>with the political process &mdash; but also selectively in different elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>From where does that right come?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I can give the Minister of State the 1999 figures. In the 1999 local elections there were 25,000 spoiled votes, in respect of 40% of which the ballot papers were blank. In the European elections held on the same day there were 46,500 votes deemed ineligible. In respect of 70% of these the ballot papers were blank. One does not need to be an Einstein to work out that the blank ballot papers were returned by those who chose to abstain selectively from the various elections which took place on that day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an interpretation with which I would necessarily agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Blank ballot papers mean abstentions. Electors had a series of voting papers and they chose to fill some in while leaving others empty. They could do this in a paper system but their ability to do so in an electronic system will be severely compromised.</P>
    <P>The real lesson the Government needs to learn in foisting this dangerously divisive citizenship referendum on us is that in the referendum in 1999, a non-contentious referendum on local government, there were 110,000 ineligible votes on the same day as the local and European elections. Unfortunately, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has never released figures on how many of the ballot papers were blank but the likelihood is that the trend in the local and European elections on the same day was repeated to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I would like to see how the Government will have an electronic voting system in place on 11 June with four sets of ballot papers on the same day. The possibility that electors may want the right to abstain selectively, depending on the election or referendum in which they choose to participate, has not been thought through.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have mentioned a third level, the ability of the visually impaired to mark their votes properly and secretly. It might be said that with the paper ballot there was always a degree of sharing the voting intentions of a visually impaired person with a third party but the electronic system increases the lack of secrecy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Several more people are involved. If we are talking about using information technology in a more advanced way, a means could have been found to ensure a tactile or auditory response which would enable the visually impaired to use technology to cast their votes. The Minister might say the intention is to encourage such persons to use postal votes but that is reverting back to the old technology. The <Col N="613"/>point the Government seems to be missing is that people with disabilities want to live independently and express their intentions in the same way as other citizens. We should give them every opportunity to do so but unfortunately the Government&rsquo;s proposal does not allow this.</P>
    <P>Moving away from the issue of secrecy, there is also the question of the accuracy of the system. Those of us who are aware of the potential of information technology wish to see it progress and used more widely in society. However, we also know that it carries significant risks. Any computer based system can produce different outputs from similar inputs which harks back to the fact that the source code is secret and vested in a third party operating outside the jurisdiction. The security of the system depends on this knowledge.</P>
    <P>We have been assured as far as we can be by a Minister who, I am certain, is not technically capable of making any argument in relation to his brief. We argued this point last week. The security methods endorsed to date do not represent a full testing of the system. In the first instance, it seems the testing only covered the possibility of attack by unauthorised persons who were not defined. It did not seem to take into account the fact that there were risks posed by authorised persons at different stages of the process &mdash; staff at storage depots, maintenance staff and the workers of Nedap/Powervote.</P>
    <P>This reopens the security argument. At least with the paper based system possible interference was restricted to the time before the vote was placed in a box which was sealed and subsequently opened and the period after the box was opened at an election count. With the electronic system, the potential for abuse by third parties is far greater because there will be several additional stages, and the likelihood is that the Government has not tested any of these grounds. It has certainly not tested the procedures for storing, transporting, setting up and dismantling e-voting systems because all the arguments made were made after the Government stated appropriate security tests had been carried out. The failure to ask what security tests had been done and the extent to which they had been done and what they had showed only underlines the lack of confidence many on this side of the House have in the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
    <P>To a small extent, we have seen the company&rsquo;s machines in operation. Last week there was a local referendum in the Netherlands in which the voting system used was not exactly the same but the same company and the same technology we are supposed to be buying, technology in which we are meant to have confidence, was employed. The referendum was not a success. There were difficulties. It involved testing in an actual vote. The Government needs to respond but it is not willing to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government, in which Fianna F&aacute;il is the majority party, is coming round to a strange irony. This is its latest attempt to change the way <Col N="614"/>people vote, although it relates to the system of voting rather than the mechanics involved. Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s arguments about voting in 1959 and 1968 centred on the need to simplify the system. It argued that the people would not be able to continually look at the complexities of the STV-PR system and produce the appropriate response &mdash; meaning that occasionally Fianna F&aacute;il would not serve in government. The reality is that the people rejected Fianna F&aacute;il Governments quite emphatically.</P>
    <P>The Government may need to think about this issue because it wants to change the Constitution in otherwise very warped ways but the likelihood is that if such a proposal for electronic voting was put to the people, it would be rejected because of the loss of confidence. The Government is failing to introduce a system in which the people can have faith. At the end of the day there will be a question mark. I do not ascribe it to attempts by Fianna F&aacute;il to gerrymander the system. History and destiny will take care of this.</P>
    <P>We are already set on a course where the people are choosing to vote differently. It is important, therefore, that our voting system, the bedrock on which the people express their support for a system of representative democracy, is one in which they can have confidence. I fear the Government, not only by the legislation it has introduced but, more importantly, the method by which it has chosen to introduce it &mdash; what it has referred to as a consultation period and debate that preceded it &mdash; is attempting to make a significant change in the nature of our democracy. I hope there are some, either within the Government parties or among the individuals who comprise the Government, who will think hard before legislation of this type is passed and that we will not have a fiasco in how the mandate is sought for local and European bodies on 11 June.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate on this issue has been taking place for some time. I am sorry Deputy Boyle is leaving as I wanted to address some of the issues he raised. Perhaps he will listen in his office. He referred to the referenda held in 1959 and 1968, times when a referendum was held at the same time as other elections. It is ironic that the Green Party is criticising the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, for proposing to hold a referendum on the same day as other elections and at the same time praising the one occasion when it occurred and acknowledging the people are more than capable of separating issues on a given day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is appreciating the fact that it is valid.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The point was that they were able to separate the issues involved. My criticism is that the Opposition is not generous enough to acknowledge the people&rsquo;s capacity to distinguish <Col N="615"/>the issues involved if we were to proceed with the referendum on citizenship on 11 June.</P>
    <P>I would also have liked to refer Deputy Boyle to an historical truth on what he calls gerrymandering. It was the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government which tried to gerrymander the 1977 election but it went horribly wrong. It tried to create optimum seat gains for itself by changing the number of seats in various constituencies. The effect was that Fianna F&aacute;il won three out of four seats in many constituencies and gained a huge majority, which generally was probably not great for it. To say Fianna F&aacute;il had exclusive control over this issue was a distortion.</P>
    <P>In much of the recent debate there has been reference to Luddism. I have not had time to look up who Mr. Ludd was. Apparently, there was a group of English rebels who believed industrialisation was terrible for England. Various stories emerged of people lying on railway tracks to stop trains. They were objecting to all manifestations of industrialisation. Luddites are considered to be those against progress in general and afraid of the consequences of change. The description is fairly safe and accurate for the opponents of this measure as they are not being honest in their objections. In many cases the objections are clearly the result of a particular political agenda, evidence of an axe to grind. There is no strong argument made, just possible arguments. That Deputy Boyle referred to the referenda held in 1959 and 1968 proves the weakness of the argument. The Green Party is hoping that by bringing so much doubt to the system it will be a case of death by 1,000 cuts. There is nothing particularly damaging that it can suggest, except to continually hark on about the dangers it might pose.</P>
    <P>In today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>there is a good article which makes the argument very clear. It refers to the fact that on a daily basis 747s lift off into the sky. We have all bought into them. We have all travelled. We are not afraid that they travel on auto pilot across the ocean. Nobody appears to concern themselves about this. Nobody appears to concern themselves with the fact that the passage of aircraft over airports is controlled by computers in general at air traffic control. The safety of our person would be considered to be endangered by computers in this area but people do not have this fear.</P>
    <P>At the same time we are supposed to accept the argument from the Opposition that there is a grave danger that these computer systems will either be hacked into or damaged by those with a mission to destroy the system. I do not think that will happen. I trust computers. I cannot look behind what is proposed by the Government in terms of the computer technology involved. I have to assume that the company hired is doing the right thing. I have to assume that the tests were carried out in a professional manner and accept that the technology used will be safe. What <Col N="616"/>I can question is whether the Opposition, in pursuing this objection, is doing so with any degree of honesty.</P>
    <P>On a routine basis, one of the most irritating aspects of voting in this Chamber is when a member of the Opposition calls for a vote through the lobbies. This is done because, allegedly, the Whip of the Opposition has formed an opinion that the computer system is not correct. Somehow or other the Opposition satisfies itself that there is a serious danger that some injustice is about to be done and that the democratic will of the Chamber is not reflected in the computer vote read-out. Therefore, it calls for a vote through the lobbies. We waste another ten minutes of parliamentary time, which is at premium, walking through the gates and having our names ticked off in this Stone Age fashion.</P>
    <P>Any right thinking person knows perfectly well the reason this is being done is to try to annoy, irritate, embarrass, or destabilise the Government&rsquo;s position. In other words, the objection to the voting system is designed only to pursue another political end. It is not in itself an objection to the outcome of the vote, rather it is used to try to destabilise the Government. It is used as a stick with which to beat the Government. Therefore, I argue strongly that the same motivation and incentive lies behind objections to this Bill. Fears are being stoked about the computers to be used, the potential for hacking and the research which went into the creation of the codes. In all of this, there is no doubt that the Opposition is motivated by the desire to find a stick with which to beat the Government, as Opposition Members would accept if they were honest. I challenge the Opposition to call a walking vote when the Bill is voted upon. Shame on them if they do so, because it would expose this situation for what it is. The Opposition is playing games with a serious issue, something to which I greatly object.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle referred to the abstention votes of those who enter voting booths with their ballot papers but do not vote. The Deputy suggested such abstention votes are somehow sacred and should be protected as if they are a healthy part of Irish democracy. I do not agree. To allege that this is worthy of protection is dysfunctional. If somebody has gone to the extent of going to a polling station, had his or her name signed off the register, entered the polling booth with his or her ballot paper and then found no candidate to satisfy his or her political aims, something is wrong. We should not legislate for those who cannot find a candidate.</P>
    <P>In the last general election some 17 candidates were included in the ballot paper in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire. I cannot believe there was not some candidate who would reflect the views of the vast majority of voters in the constituency. Nonetheless, it seems to be the view of Opposition Members that we should legislate for this type of dysfunctionality. If anything, we could perhaps provide a button on the voting <Col N="617"/>machine to reflect the need of people to abstain from the system because they do not buy into Irish democracy or because there are not enough political parties to represent their views, which I find hard to believe.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we should make this change to the electoral law without cross-party support. In general, it is better to make changes to the procedure of electoral law with the support of all political parties because it goes to the core of the way we run our democracy. There should be no need for this lengthy debate or to repeatedly explain the safety of the system. It is a pity this is necessary but that is the nature of politics today. It reflects the division within the Opposition in regard to the upcoming local elections and the desire to achieve some kind of prominence on issues that interest the people, but it does not reflect any strongly held belief.</P>
    <P>We could set up a Ministry for conspiracy theories, given the number in circulation. If it is not a case of the grassy knoll, it is Princess Diana&rsquo;s or Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s driver.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Or a case of &ldquo;was there a meeting or not?&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will have his opportunity to explain that to the public in due course. In any case, whether there was a meeting is irrelevant, although I would be happy to discuss the matter in another forum. However, I wish to discuss the conspiracy issue and the suggestion that Fianna F&aacute;il has, somehow, stitched this up to try to ensure hegemony for eternity. It is said to be a great plan by Fianna F&aacute;il to rub out all Opposition parties in order that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies would fill the Chamber and there would be no Opposition, perhaps with the exception of Deputy Enright. The Opposition suggests, however, that it has cleverly found this out and has blown our cover. The suggestion is silly and does not stand up. As the debate continues, fewer Members say such things because they sound increasingly ridiculous.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on the Bill neither as a madly committed electronic voting expert with a vested interest in a computer company or voting machine, nor a member of the club of tallymen. I know from what she said recently on radio that Deputy Enright was a member of that profession, as, indeed, was the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
    <P>I come from a background in teaching. When I began teaching junior infants, I often had to use an abacus. By the time I left teaching in 1997, we had, thankfully, moved on to calculators and computers. It is a question of moving with the times. There is no suggestion of any kind of conspiracy other than this.</P>
    <P>My only reservation is that in talking about electronic voting, we are only moving one step beyond the manual paper voting system. I have used the electronic voting system on two <Col N="618"/>occasions, once for the general election and once for the Nice treaty. All of those I spoke to, of all ages, seem to have had little or no difficulty using the system.</P>
    <P>When one considers the opportunities we have in our personal lives, whether setting the video recorder to record tonight&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, which we would all want to watch in omnibus version at the end of the week, or a match, which is more likely, we all engage on an ongoing basis with the new electronic media. If we were serious about e-voting, we would be able to vote using our mobile phones on a constituency based electronic register for which we would all have a PIN number, in the same way we have such numbers for bank accounts. However, we are taking just one small step in the direction of modernising our rather antiquated voting system.</P>
    <P>We should not return to the system of a shouted vote which operated in County Clare and elsewhere, whereby a voter stood at the door of the polling station and shouted out his or her preference. The Government is trying to bring this process forward in order that we will engage with the electronic systems in a reasonably proactive way. However, much mischievous comment has been made in this regard. Members, who otherwise have made fine contributions in this Chamber on other legislation, have been gratuitous in the way they have insulted the Minister, and tendentious in the way they have put forward arguments about what the Minister and Government are trying to do. If we in Fianna F&aacute;il were so good at conspiracies, we would be able to rule by overall majority. This has escaped us and the experts agree it is unlikely we will return to it in the short term, although, naturally, we will work towards it.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with providing opportunities for voters, particularly the young, to exercise their franchise. It is difficult. I spend a good deal of my time talking to transition year students, junior certificate students, university students and people in ordinary communities, trying to give them reasons why they ought to vote. This should be advanced as one more reason they, as members of one of the most modern communities in the western world which is wide open to globalisation and embracing change at a fantastic rate, should surely give them opportunities.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the argument that older persons, even the elderly, cannot engage in the process of electronic voting. In Dublin city libraries, for example, there are many elderly persons who regularly e-mail their sons and daughters living abroad or elsewhere in the country. They engage with the senior help line and are able to access the Internet. We should not be looking down our noses and deciding they could not possibly do this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of electronic voting will, as has been stated by others, help those persons who mistakenly spoil their vote. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and I share a constituency. I have been disappointed and often appalled at <Col N="619"/>the level of spoiled votes in each election in our constituency and others throughout the country. If one has an opportunity to examine the voting paper, one will find that the vote has been spoiled by mistake. With electronic voting that will not be possible and will not happen to the same extent. That is another good reason we ought to promote it.</P>
    <P>I was in the RTE studio on the night of the first counts in the last general election. I pitied Nora Owen because of the manner in which the results were outlined to her and her colleagues. The changes made in the system will make it easier for all of us who, sooner or later, will have to listen to the news of whether our vote has gone up or down. At least there will be time to prepare for that moment. Those tied to the tally system might well have an opportunity of analysing the pattern of voting which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>There has been endless argument about the validity and accuracy of the machines. No matter how often it is said, one either believes or not that this stand-alone machine is accurate and tamper-proof. It is about as likely that one can tamper with the machine as one can go around the country tampering with every single ATM machine; it is possible but highly unlikely. For this reason we should try to ensure in the comments made by us from now on we reinforce the confidence of the electorate in this new system which is tried and trusted and has been in use elsewhere and in this country. The fear is unfounded.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on whether the argument about the verifiable paper trail stands up. I do not pretend to understand all of the implications. I have listened to speakers from both sides of the argument. However, there are sufficient safeguards in the legislation and the mechanism of the machines to prevent tampering.</P>
    <P>In the manual system a vote is cast by marking the ballot paper and putting into the ballot box. A conspiracy theorist could say that perhaps the box has no or a false bottom, and that it could be tampered with on its way to the counting centre. We all know that this is unlikely to happen because we work on the basis of trust, although ballot boxes have been mislaid and sometimes lost.</P>
    <P>The paper trail can be established by a visit to the District Court. The proposed system provides for an accurate transfer of one&rsquo;s vote which is not the case under the current system.</P>

   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Andrews expressed his disappointment that Deputy Boyle had left the Chamber and I must say the same about Deputy Andrews. He raised a number of issues with which I will deal.</P>
    <P>I do not think Fine Gael or anyone on this side of the House has ever doubted the capacity of the people to distinguish between the issues. With regard to the proposed referendum on citizenship, my core concern is how this issue was <Col N="620"/>dealt with in the last general election. Certain persons used the issue as a means of raising their own profile, the reason I am concerned about holding the referendum on 11 June. When he spoke earlier in the House the Taoiseach stated it would not happen but neither he nor any other party leader is truly in a position to say what will be said by individual candidates on the issue. That kind of abuse is appalling, the reason I have concerns about the referendum being held on the same day as the elections. Such abuse by elected representatives or persons purporting to become elected representatives cannot be tolerated. It is not about whether the people will understand the issue but about how the issue may be used and abused for self-promotion.</P>
    <P>I do not have a fear of change. I am not familiar with the history of the Luddites or Mr. Ludd but Deputy Andrews gave the House a brief introduction to the subject. We must ensure transparency in the system and that is my concern.</P>
    <P>On the point of calling for a vote by walking through the lobbies in this House, it is important to note that it is a rule of the House and is permissible. I was not a Member of the House when the system was changed. The rule for calling for such votes is in place and Members are entitled to use it. From my recollection of what has happened in the House on previous occasions, it has been used to highlight the Opposition&rsquo;s objection to particular issues or highlight their seriousness. I do not believe it has been abused and Members are entitled to use it. The Ceann Comhairle has the final say in allowing the Whips&rsquo; request to vote by walking through the lobbies. There should not be criticism of the use of the system in the House. A correlation cannot be drawn with our objections to electronic voting. I do not see the connection the Deputy was trying to make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey is not now present in the Chamber but in answer to his point about moving with the times, I do not have any such objection but I do have an objection to just teaching children to use calculators in schools. I would prefer if they learned to do addition and subtraction on an abacus and their fingers and by using tables but I am sure that is not the point he intended to make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey also expressed the notion that we should move and progress further with the electronic voting system at a later date by the use of PIN numbers, for example. I warn that if we progress further than this and consider the possibility of voting by means of telephone text or e-mail, there is a possibility of votes being sold. This matter was examined in the United States, in either California or Florida. I could sell my PIN number to Enda Kenny and he could use it to vote effectively. We should be careful about progressing because the system is not as simple or as clear as stated by Deputy Carey.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey also referred to the tally system. I was a tally person but will not shed too many <Col N="621"/>tears at its passing. The Deputy said he pitied Nora Owen because of the situation in which she found herself. That is a relevant point. I have been in the House when a seat was lost but if one is involved in politics, one learns to get on with matters. The feelings of politicians do not need to be taken into account when considering the system. What we are most concerned with is the openness and transparency of the system from the perspective of the electorate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the Opposition using this issue as a stick with which to beat the Government. I suggest to him that there is no shortage of sticks with which to beat the Government that we do not need to use this system to do so. I draw his attention to the psychological service, special needs, the widow&rsquo;s pension, the condition of schools, the withdrawal of medical cards, hospital waiting lists, the second coming of 2,000 garda&iacute; and the spiralling serious crime rate. There are plenty of sticks available. We do not need to jump on this issue as one with which to beat the Government.</P></Speaker>

    <P el="5" FLI="0">This is a reasonable and timely motion as we approach the sixth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. It sends out a strong message from the democratically elected assembly of the Republic of Ireland that, while we are pleased with the political progress made since the Good Friday Agreement, it is time for a demonstrable and exclusive commitment to the democratic process in the conduct of the affairs of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On 22 May 1998 the people spoke unequivocally for peace and democracy alone and I am certain that remains their view today. The Fine Gael Party has always believed passionately in a peaceful and democratic solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. In government and opposition, through Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish Agreements, we worked hard to make progress on Northern Ireland issues. As the Taoiseach will acknowledge, we have never made capital out of Northern Ireland, although there were plenty of occasions and reasons for doing so. I recognise the contribution all Governments have made to this process over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>As far as the Fine Gael Party has always been concerned, there is room in this country for one army alone, namely, the legitimate armed forces of the State, the Defence Forces established by this party when we founded the State. The one true &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann is the force which exists to defend and protect the State, not those endorsed by somebody known as P. O&rsquo;Neill which exist to subvert it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the British army either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary that, at a time when Ireland holds the Presidency of one of the most sophisticated and powerful political, social and economic blocs in the world, Members of this democratically elected Parliament have associations with a private army which has exerted its particular lethal form of pressure when democratic methods have not favoured it. I <Col N="623"/>find it deplorable, as a democrat and the leader of Fine Gael, the united Ireland party, that Members of this House have a perfectly symbiotic relationship with one of the most vile and cowardly paramilitary organisations the world has known.</P>
    <P>Jean McConville&rsquo;s son related this week how at least a dozen masked individuals came to take his mother from her small children at bath-time for questioning. Those interrogators and their successors have yet to declare that Jean McConville was not an informer and that the only code she had broken was to show some humanity to a dying British soldier. Someone knows who pulled the trigger and ordered her murder and someone should clear her name of the accusation of being an informer.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years we have had relative peace on this island. Unlike me and many others, there are teenagers today who do not remember what it was like in the bleak days of Greysteel, Teebane and Enniskillen. The deplorable Madrid bombings brought home to them and all of us the kind of murderous threat with which the Irish people on all sides lived for 30 years of the Troubles. We lived the terror and its consequences, not just for the generation of the time but also for generations to come.</P>
    <P>The stories of small children waiting long into the night at cr&egrave;ches in the poorer Madrid suburbs for parents who would never collect them were harrowing for all to hear and all parents to understand. Those children and their damaged lives are part of the enduring legacy of the Madrid bombers, just as the families who make up Justice for the Forgotten or the Omagh relatives are part of the legacy of political violence here.</P>
    <P>It is high time that we placed the needs of victims centre stage. Voiceless people such as families and relatives of the 31 victims of the Omagh atrocity must be supported. I look forward with interest to the details of the British Government&rsquo;s plans for a truth and reconciliation commission which might help such people achieve some level of closure.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware, I met the families of victims on a number of occasions. When I asked one man his views on a truth and reconciliation commission, he stated he did not disagree with the proposal or fine rhetoric but he also asked if he was expected to put his arms around the perpetrator, say he forgave them and walk away with a picture of his dead wife who was blown through the shutters of a shop. When one asks the victims what they want, they say they want truth, which we can all support.</P>
    <P>As the World Trade Centre bombings of 2001 and the recent Madrid bombings show, terrorism knows no borders. It is critically important, therefore, that we have international co-operation in tackling and eradicating the terror threat. In fairness to the Taoiseach and the <Col N="624"/>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in their capacities as chairman of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the European Union Presidency, respectively, they are working in that field. I hope the question of sharing intelligence and information is addressed in a way which ensures the perpetrators of terrorist crimes are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I noted the comments of the Taoiseach and the Minister on continued paramilitary activity and criminality on both sides of the Border. I suggest to them that wrapping themselves publicly in the tricolour is of little effect in bringing anybody to book. The paramilitaries have not gone away and will never go away without decisive action and the full rigour of the law being used with targeted precision against them on both sides of the Border. It is an affront to the democratic will of the people that they continue to exist, not to mention operate, and an outrage to our sensibility that Members of this House who have a symbiotic relationship with paramilitarism occasionally lecture us on human rights, ethics and standards. They do the House and the people no justice.</P>
    <P>In the Ireland of 2004 there should be no need for baseball bats, balaclavas and broken legs. In this matter the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must ensure the forces of law and order are supplied with the resources necessary to put known criminal organisations associated with paramilitary organisations out of business.</P>
    <P>The dynamics of politics in Northern Ireland have changed radically following the November Assembly elections and the arrival centre stage of the DUP, on one side, and Sinn F&eacute;in, on the other. The motion recognises the changed political landscape which has resulted from the DUP receiving a vastly increased mandate on a platform of refusing to participate in a power sharing government while the republican movement remained active. This brings a new reality to Northern Ireland politics and the political dimension on the island. We want the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full but it is clear this cannot and will not happen unless one of its core principles, the absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means, is upheld.</P>
    <P>Since the elections, the British Government has been consistent and resolute on the need for paramilitaries to end their activities. It is appropriate that we too send a strong message. It is what the people want and demand. I support the setting up of public inquiries as outlined in the recent Cory report. It is absolutely imperative that the truth about collusion in killings in Northern Ireland be known and made known. While the IRA may not be blowing up members of the security forces, it is still involved in violent and illegal activities such as trafficking and racketeering. There are also abductions such as the Tohill case. This group is actively involved in recruiting and training new members, a pretty unusual step for maintaining the apparatus of a <Col N="625"/>private army if this army has no future, only a past. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has reminded the House, the Real IRA is in the business of planning another Omagh atrocity. If the members of these organisations are serious about democratic politics on the island of Ireland, there is no need for this activity which should cease forthwith.</P>
    <P>The Chief Constable of the PSNI, Hugh Orde, has warned that the marching season is approaching and that we cannot allow a vacuum to take hold. There has been no real political progress in Northern Ireland since the November elections, despite the dedicated efforts of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. Moves must now be made to combat paramilitarism if the institutions are to be restored and the Assembly allowed to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>This debate offers Deputies on all sides an opportunity to support the motion in order that a strong message can be sent from this House on behalf of the people we serve that we want politics to work and the terror to end in order that the people of Northern Ireland can look forward to a peaceful and fulfilling future for themselves and generations to come.</P>
    <P>It is no great pursuit of mine as to whether Gerry Adams was ever a member of the IRA, or whether he is still a member of its army council. Members of the Sinn F&eacute;in group in this House have admitted their membership of the IRA in the past. That is not my concern now as I cannot change the past but we can influence the future. It is up to the members of all paramilitary organisations &mdash; I have met some reformed members in Northern Ireland in the Shankill, Taughmona and other places &mdash; to now see the reality of the pursuit of democratic politics.</P>
    <P>This motion, tabled as we approach the sixth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and the local and European elections in the Republic, provides a real opportunity to state that the end has come and the war is over, that people are truly committed to democratic politics and that they will end paramilitary activities. I include paramilitary activities on all sides in this. If we are to build a country of which we can be truly proud, which can in its own time decide or otherwise the timing of a united Ireland, there is no place for paramilitary activity in any community. The Taoiseach supports and has worked towards this. I long for the day when the people of Ireland can make this decision in their own way, far removed from the influence of paramilitary organisations and their dastardly deeds. The motion offers all Deputies on all sides the opportunity to send the clear signal that we are all committed to a future, of which we can all be proud.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The central issue in the motion before the House is the call on members of all paramilitary groups to end all illegal activities and disperse, thus allowing their organisations to become a thing of the past. If <Col N="626"/>one looks at the Government amendment, the main point almost exactly coincides with the call from the three parties in opposition, as it calls on the members of all paramilitary groups to end all illegal activities, thus allowing their organisations to complete the transition to exclusively democratic means.</P>
    <P>The central point of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is that it seeks to have the House acknowledge the progress made thus far in removing armed force from the political situation, in particular the IRA cessation since 1994, and urges continuing political progress in order that physical force from any source can finally be removed from politics. The central issue for the House, therefore, is whether we can unanimously call on all members of paramilitary groups to unequivocally end all illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I recognise the point in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment and acknowledge the progress made in removing armed force, in particular the IRA cessation in 1994. Sinn F&eacute;in has come a long way across the bridge. I invite it to come all the way across to join the other parties in this House in a clear, unequivocal call to all paramilitary organisations to end all illegal activities. I urge it to respond positively to this invitation when its members speak on the motion. If that happens, we will have a united voice in the House seeking an end to all paramilitary activity on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I endorse what the leader of Fine Gael said when he stated how timely this motion was. It is six years next Good Friday since the Belfast Agreement was signed. In that agreement there was a reaffirmation of a commitment of all participants to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. It is nothing new to seek an unequivocal commitment to the ending of all paramilitary activity. It is salutory to say the Good Friday Agreement sought to have the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years, following endorsements in referenda, North and South. We had our referenda and got our endorsements with very substantial majorities. Two years went by but we still do not have an end to paramilitary activity. We still have not had complete decommissioning. That is my request to the House tonight.</P>
    <P>I have been through these discussions in the past as I played a small role in the Anglo-Irish Agreement as Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have been closely following developments over the years. While progress has been made, we need to complete the job. The total ending of paramilitary activity is an essential part of its completion.</P>
    <P>When I was in Belfast yesterday chairing a committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I had the opportunity to talk to the various political parties present. We also had discussions with the Secretary of State and I was able to get a fairly complete and up-to-date briefing on the political mood in Northern Ireland. It is clear that <Col N="627"/>if political progress is to be made in the coming 12 months or so, a total ending of paramilitary activity must be achieved. Without this and a complete disbandment of paramilitary organisations I do not see much prospect for political progress in the new changed political scene in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While the number of awful atrocities has abated considerably, it is clear that there is considerable paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I accept that all of the information suggests the majority of the incidents are on the loyalist side. The figures given to me suggest that the proportion is about two thirds to one third but this is not the point. The point is that there is paramilitary activity on both sides and a demand must be made to end it and disband all paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>While I am saying paramilitary activity should be brought to an end without qualification and equivocation, I am not unmindful of the need for political progress at the same time. Therefore, while I do not anticipate that there will be a rush to make such progress, there are some promising signs coming from Northern Ireland. The DUP document entitled, Devolution Now, is interesting. It is worth studying and makes a contribution to political developments in Northern Ireland. I appreciate that it only deals with strand one and that there are further documents promised on strands two and three. However, I believe it represents a conscious effort on the part of the DUP to contribute constructively to political discussions in Northern Ireland. It has taken seriously its position as the leading Unionist party. I would not have thought a number of years ago that I would have been the one to produce a DUP document in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but perhaps this is a political development also. I do so merely to develop the point that there are some signs of political development and progress in Northern Ireland. There are possibilities.</P>
    <P>Although I call for total decommissioning and a total end to paramilitary activity, I realise this will not happen in the absence of political discussion. However, it is not appropriate that the ending of paramilitary activity should in any way be made dependent on political progress. A commitment was made and an end to paramilitary activity must be achieved irrespective of the political outcome.</P>
    <P>There will be other developments in the short term which will include the report of the independent monitoring commission. I do not know what will be contained in the report but it seems reasonable to assume that it will confirm a level of paramilitary activity and an involvement in the Bobby Tohill abduction. I understand a further report will be published by the commission in October. All I can do &mdash; I am not anticipating the report due next week &mdash; is invite those who are involved, interested and have influence to make sure that by the time the commission reports again in October it will be <Col N="628"/>able to report a total end to all paramilitary activity. I issue this invitation to those who might listen or carry the message beyond this House.</P>
    <P>I am not unmindful of the fact that when we speak about terrorism and paramilitary activity, we do so in the context of international terrorism &mdash; this is not just an island on its own in the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, the activities that have occurred here may provide an example &mdash; a damn bad one, if I may say so &mdash; to people in other countries. Correspondingly, an end to such activities would provide a good example to those in other countries who might be tempted to engage in terrorist or paramilitary activity. Let this be an additional benefit to be derived from a complete ending of all paramilitary activities. We are not unaffected by what happens abroad and those in other countries are not and will not be unaffected by what happens here.</P>
    <P>The main message we wish to have delivered is that the democratic will of the people as expressed in the referendum should now, at long last, be honoured. Let us develop the political process and use the instruments, institutions and structures in place. Progress has been made from this point of view. I have no doubt that further progress will be made. This progress can only be furthered by a complete and unqualified adoption of the motion before the House. Therefore, I plead with all parties to support it totally and without qualification. That would be a very good night&rsquo;s work.</P>

	<P><?oasys _ic16-?>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Fine Gael as a chuid ama a roinnt. Dar linn sa Chomhaontas Ghlas, the Green Party, n&iacute; m&oacute;r deireadh a chur le for&eacute;igean le cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; polaiti&uacute;la a bhaint amach. Sin c&uacute;is taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n seo. The murky world of violence and the threat of violence pervade many areas of the world, not least the northern part of this island. If I may speak more globally, at the recent Green Party Ard-Fheis in Galway I met friends of Ingrid Betancourt, the Green presidential candidate in Colombia who was kidnapped two years ago by FARC guerrillas, as far as we understand. She is still being held and we hope she is still alive. She has attended to the needs of the poor, particularly poor children, and stood against corruption and drug trafficking. I appeal for her release and information on her whereabouts. Her children, Melanie, Lorenzo and Sebastien, and her husband, close friends and family are beside themselves with anxiety and distress. On their behalf and on behalf of Greens worldwide, I am seeking information and, I hope, her safe return.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
    <P>Violence thrives in a culture where it is tolerated. As tension grows, it spirals until it is out of control. This is the situation in Colombia where kidnapping and drug trafficking are the two main income sources of the FARC guerrillas and others. Even though the Government of Colombia has serious questions to answer, it does <Col N="629"/>not give FARC or anybody else a licence to kill, terrorise, kidnap or traffick drugs. Likewise, in Ireland, this debate comes less than a week after the Cory report which followed the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which, in turn, followed the report of the stakeknife affair. Such reports make one wonder if it suits some securocrats to prolong the cycle of violence. Are some paramilitaries calling the shots or are pathetic puppets at times maintained by collusion and an excuse for heavy spending on state militarism? Whatever the case, the continued existence of armed groups operating outside the law is poison to the development of a peaceful democratic and sustainable society.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement, which enjoyed huge cross-party and wider popular support, set down a clear requirement for an end to paramilitarism and a process of demilitarisation. Regrettably, it has emerged that the wriggle room for both sides has developed into stand-off positions, and the stalling of the de Chastelain process and the collapse of institutions are examples of this. The threat of violence is still in existence in spite of comments at a secret briefing by a senior Sinn F&eacute;in member last week who, apparently, stated that there will be an end to the IRA when an irreversible political process of change is working in the North.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement, as far as this party is concerned, is that democratically mandated irreversible political process. The paramilitaries&rsquo; day is done. Sadly, the manifestation of paramilitarism is now being seen in racist as well as sectarian and vigilante attacks and criminality in general. This is community relations week in the North. One of the strongest current arguments against the paramilitarist culture in the North is the racist turn. Loyalist paramilitarists, in particular, are transforming their infrastructure of intimidation into mechanisms for vigilantism. They attack and warn off foreign nationals moving into parts of Belfast and other cities. Northern Ireland has recently been dubbed internationally as Europe&rsquo;s race hate capital.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of this debate is also served by reflecting on how other parties, apart from Sinn F&eacute;in, must play a role in moving onwards the process of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is unfortunate, to put it mildly, that no formal role has been granted to the other opposition parties to input to the Good Friday Agreement review. For it is in that review more than anywhere else that progress, if it is to be made, will be made.</P>
    <P>The core weaknesses in the Agreement, in the process that led up to it and in the strategy of the Governments in their attempts to implement it has been the failure to call a spade a spade. By fudging the definition of the problem and being unclear about the chronology of the implementation of the Agreement&rsquo;s provisions, it has come to mean different things to different people. It is time for clearer language. One of the <Col N="630"/>unstated dynamics of the Agreement process has been an incrementalism which allowed restrictive leaderships to both push and pull their constituencies as the logic of the Agreement took hold. This applied to republican and Unionist leaderships alike and a necessary prerequisite for successful completion has been a mutual acceptance and expectation that party leaderships would, and could, bring their constituencies so far given the time and opportunity. It is this dynamic which has been undermined by indecision on the part of the Unionists and a lack of boldness by the republican leadership.</P>
    <P>Of course, we demand an end to all paramilitary activity &mdash; it would be strange if we did not &mdash; however, we must also be clear in our opposition to Unionist intransigence. Northern Ireland remains caught in a classic post-colonial bind. The Governments must make it clear to anti-Agreement unionism that it will not be rewarded for its obstructionist approach with indefinite direct rule. If the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland refuse to deliver the Agreement for which the people there and here voted, it is for the Governments to deliver its objective jointly and in partnership. This point reflects the private briefing by the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson mentioned earlier. There is a strong case for pushing both Governments to be bold in taking up their ultimate responsibility for delivering the will of the people who supported the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In a sense, we are returning to the logic of the Anglo-Irish Agreement mentioned by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe wherein the Governments used their democratic legitimacy to step out in front of what unionism was prepared to deliver and thus force its hand in terms of entering the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. If the Agreement is to be implemented, all parties to it must fulfil all their commitments. This has implications for the British Government, particularly in regard to the human rights provisions as well as for unionism and nationalism. The time for sequencing and choreography has passed. We need to identify all the areas where implementation has been delayed and deliver on them immediately following the review. The Agreement belongs to us all, North and South. The Opposition parties here need to be drawn formally into the Agreement so that all the political capital available is put to good use, and I include the Independent Deputies in that.</P>
    <P>Increasingly calls are being made by the Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas &mdash; and others for some truth and reconciliation commission to be established to get to the bottom of how and why atrocities were carried out on all sides. However, for many, such a commission will not be possible or useful unless, and until, paramilitaries disband, and the Green Party looks forward to that day without further delays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned the DUP and how we might be looking at progress being made even though it is not enough progress. I thought <Col N="631"/>it symbolic and interesting to hear that this weekend in the Europa Hotel in Belfast all the participants in the world Irish dancing championships were welcomed by the DUP&rsquo;s Ruth Patterson. In opening the championships, she stated &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte go dt&iacute; Oireachtas Rinnce na Cruinne 2004&rdquo;. That indicates some hope of which, I hope, everybody involved in the process will take note. That welcome was also echoed by Sammy Wilson, the former DUP Lord Mayor of Belfast. I think we are looking at changing mindsets and situations in the North. I hope those involved in paramilitarism can respect and embrace that and end their activities once and for all.</P>

    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>urges all the political parties in Northern Ireland to commit themselves to this objective and, accordingly, to engage constructively and proactively in the current review of the operation of the Good Friday Agreement;</P>

    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>rededicates itself to the Good Friday Agreement as the template for a fair and honourable accommodation between both traditions whose principles of democracy, consent, inclusion, partnership, equality and mutual respect are not open to compromise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">I wish to share my time with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Coughlan.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the central elements of the Opposition motion. It is important these issues are discussed and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. The Government believes that its amendment is necessary to take account of the broader dimensions of Government policy in regard to the peace process and to reflect recent significant developments, including the Cory reports and the work being undertaken by the international monitoring commission. The Government&rsquo;s goals, as reflected in its amendment, are open and transparent and, as Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe pointed out, it covers all the aspects in the motion.</P>
    <P>We are committed to working for progress in Northern Ireland. We want to fully implement the Agreement and a definitive end to all paramilitarism. We want to see the return of the Assembly and devolved government. We also want comprehensive and open dialogue with all strands of unionism as well as nationalism. If everyone is willing to step up to their responsibilities and seize the opportunity, arrangements under the Agreement can be put back in place which will be stable and lasting. This is what my colleagues and I continue to strive for and work towards.</P>
    <P>On 10 April 1998, almost six years ago to the day, when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, those of us who were there recognised it had the potential to transform relationships on this island. I believed that then and I believe it now. This is why I will continue to devote my energies and time to this indispensable process, and my colleagues do likewise.</P>
    <P>The Agreement offered the opportunity of escape from the fruitless and unproductive disagreements of the past. It pointed towards a new partnership model that did not threaten the interests of any community, but empowered and enriched us all. I am entirely satisfied the Agreement that emerged after such protracted negotiations includes the elements essential to healing a divided society and building relationships on and between these islands. The two Governments are, therefore, determined to protect and promote the Agreement in every way possible. I have made the point on a number of occasions in recent months that the core of the Agreement is partnership and that a viable partnership in Northern Ireland can only be constructed on the basis of total equality between the prospective partners.</P><Col N="634"/>
    <P>On recent visits to Northern Ireland, I said there can be no half-way house between violence and democracy. I also said there can be no comfortable resting place between exclusion and partnership. It is time for all doubts and unresolved issues to be addressed. We have tried on several occasions since the Agreement was signed to do so. Last year we invested an enormous amount of time and effort in this task, and it was a frustrating experience. I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and we recalled our Easter break last year, on the fifth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. We spent almost the entire week-end dealing with the peace process. I recall the last meeting which began at 9 o&rsquo;clock on Easter Monday. In the end, we got fed up and went off to Fairyhouse having spent the entire week-end on the problem. Not only I, but a number of my colleagues who had intended going away for the week-end had been involved in the talks. That is just one example of what went on. Many others spent the entire week-end working also.</P>
    <P>However frustrating last year&rsquo;s experience was, there is no escaping the issues. Once and for all, we must solve the problems that have been undermining the peace process. Both Governments are fully committed to making progress as quickly as possible and we ask all the parties to commit themselves to the challenge. It is very clear what is needed. The commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means in the Agreement must become a reality in Northern Ireland. Partnership can only work and achieve its reconciling potential when the use or threat of force has been finally removed from the equation.</P>
    <P>Ongoing paramilitary activity and sectarian attacks erode the trust and confidence necessary to sustain the process. They obstruct efforts to achieve political progress. These activities, in all their various guises, must now be brought to a definitive end. This is a requirement for all paramilitary organisations, loyalist and republican. The republican movement has a special responsibility, given Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position of political leadership within the nationalist community. The scope of activities that must end were outlined in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration published in May 2003. They have not changed. They include military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisition or development of arms or weapons, other preparation for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings and attacks and involvement in riots.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the issue of decommissioning of paramilitary weapons to be addressed in a way that will maximise public confidence. We also want to see an end to all forms of IRA-directed criminality that have been the focus of so much attention in this jurisdiction in recent weeks. A commitment to policing is central to a Northern Ireland free of paramilitarism and criminality. Such a commitment would be the clearest sign that the <Col N="635"/>communities in Northern Ireland are moving forward together. The unionist parties have clear responsibilities. The DUP and UUP must commit themselves to the full and continuous operation of all the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. This includes power-sharing in a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive with all political parties whose mandate gives them a right of participation, and full support for, and participation in, the all-island institutions of the Agreement. Given their responsibilities, the DUP and UUP must accept that this means doing business with Sinn F&eacute;in in dealing with the issues I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opening of our dialogue with the DUP. The path to this point of engagement has not been speedily travelled. However, open and honest engagement will broaden and deepen the process of dialogue and reconciliation on this island. I said in January or early February, when the Government formally met the DUP for the first time, it was the first time during my 27 years in politics that I actually saw Mr. Robinson in person, even though he and I have been in politics for a long time. As Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe said, things move on. We must take up the pace very quickly, however, I welcome the dialogue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of proposals on the review of the Agreement by a number of parties, including the DUP. I hope the DUP&rsquo;s initial proposals covering Strand One of the Agreement will soon be followed by their proposals on the North-South and East-West dimensions of the Agreement. The challenge for the review is to collectively consider and discuss whether change can be accommodated, mindful that there is no question of degrading the fundamental values, principles or protections of the Agreement, because we cannot and will not change the fundamentals of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The restoration of devolved government on an inclusive basis is a key priority for both Governments, but the Agreement is wider than devolution. Both Governments have a responsibility to ensure that the non-devolved aspects of the Agreement continue to be implemented. The ongoing work within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is, therefore, important. It includes the implementation of commitments made in the joint declaration in the areas of criminal justice, human rights, equality and community issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State will co-chair the next meeting of the intergovernmental conference later this month at which they will advance progress on these important issues. At the same time, the Independent Monitoring Commission, which was tasked in the joint declaration with monitoring and reporting on the fulfilment of commitments in regard to the ending of paramilitary activity and the programme of security normalisation in Northern Ireland, will shortly issue its first report. It is also <Col N="636"/>empowered to consider claims that any party within the Assembly was in breach of its commitments under the Agreement. In response to a number of factors, including the incident in Kelly&rsquo;s Cellar Bar in Belfast on 20 February, the IMC agreed to bring forward its first report on ongoing paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. Both Governments expect to receive this over the coming week or so.</P>
    <P>The IMC can act as a confidence-building mechanism on a wide range of issues, particularly by offering reassurance that the activities which destabilised the institutions in the past will not escape accountability. I do not know what the impact of the IMC report will be when published. I know, however, that we can no longer avoid addressing the issues central to the Commission&rsquo;s mandate. In the interests of confidence-building, it is vital that commitments entered into by the Governments are fulfilled. In this regard, I welcome the publication last week of the four reports by Judge Peter Cory on cases of concern in Northern Ireland. I also welcome the establishment of inquiries, as recommended by Judge Cory, into the cases of Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright.</P>
    <P>The decision not to proceed at this time with the necessary public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane is disappointing. I agree with Judge Cory that such an inquiry should take place in parallel with the pending prosecution. We will continue to press our view on the British Government that the Weston Park commitments must be honoured in all cases. This means that a public inquiry in the case of Pat Finucane must be held as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a legitimate question, particularly following implementation of Judge Cory&rsquo;s recommendations, of how best we should now handle the legacy of the Troubles. I read Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s thoughtful contribution on this issue at the weekend. Secretary of State Paul Murphy has been asked to consult the parties on how this highly sensitive matter should be handled. There are many who feel that we should have embarked on such a truth and reconciliation process before now. Deputy Sargent and I have been discussing this in the House for some years. I do not know where these latest discussions will lead but I support them and I believe they are timely. I hope that a consensus emerges that will be centred on the victims and will allow this most difficult issue to be addressed in an appropriate way that will also ensure a necessary and real focus on the present and on the future.</P>
    <P>On the sixth anniversary of the Agreement I am fully aware of the need to maintain confidence in the process. When I recently met Prime Minister Blair at Hillsborough, we clearly stated our preference to see early progress on the key issues, preferably before the local and European elections in June. I assure the House that both Governments will remain in close contact with all the parties over the coming weeks to advance all opportunities for progress. I would <Col N="637"/>also like to take this opportunity to thank the Opposition parties for their ongoing support and constructive engagement as we strive to implement the Agreement fully and to achieve a lasting political settlement on this island. I assure the House that the Government and I will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to implement the Good Friday Agreement and will take account of everyone&rsquo;s concerns on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all disappointed by the lack of progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. Significant issues remain to be resolved and all parties have a role to play in addressing them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on their continuing efforts in co-operation with the British Government and the Northern Ireland political parties to move matters forward. The experience of the past 18 months has shown that this is not an easy task, but we would be wrong to lose hope. The resolution that is profoundly desired and eagerly awaited by the people of Northern Ireland can and will be found.</P>
    <P>The scourge of paramilitarism &mdash; loyalist and republican &mdash; represents without doubt a major obstacle to political progress. Criminal and sectarian acts of violence are a clear challenge to all of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law. Northern Ireland has just experienced perhaps its quietest 18 months in memory. Much work has gone into ensuring that parades pass off peacefully and that the interfaces are quiet. The number of deaths related to the security situation has fallen dramatically. Nevertheless, it is evident that the blight of paramilitarism continues to affect many communities in Northern Ireland in the form of punishment attacks, sectarian assaults, intimidation, threats, harassment, extortion and other criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has stated that approximately two-thirds of punishment attacks and shootings since 2001 are the responsibility of loyalist groups. Dissident republicans continue to be engaged in the harassment and intimidation of Catholic and Nationalist members of district policing partnerships as well as in attacking police stations in Northern Ireland. Recent months have also seen a rise in violent racist attacks on members of ethnic communities, especially in Belfast. Again, it appears that there is loyalist paramilitary involvement in such attacks.</P>
    <P>The Garda, PSNI, Criminal Assets Bureau and Assets Recovery Agency continue to work closely to combat the illegal activities of these paramilitary groupings, and Deputies will be aware that they have had many notable successes. Continuing paramilitary activity runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the people on this island. In 1998 the people voted overwhelmingly for a future free from violence and for the resolution of political differences by exclusively <Col N="638"/>peaceful means. I commend the work of the police on both sides of the Border in combating paramilitary activity and I urge everyone to give their full support to them.</P>
    <P>The House recognises the tremendous progress which has been made in bringing about the new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland as promised in the Good Friday Agreement. The benchmarks for the new policing arrangements were clearly set out in the Agreement, namely, a professional and effective police service which carries out its duties fairly and impartially, is free from partisan political control, is accountable both under the law and to the communities it serves, is representative of those same communities, and acts in accordance with the highest human rights standards.</P>
    <P>This House is well aware of the extraordinary breadth and depth of change that has taken place in policing in Northern Ireland in such a relatively short period. Northern Ireland now has a new agreed symbol and emblem representing the new beginning to policing based on partnership between the two communities; a commitment to achieving a community-centred police service as its key defining objective; a police service governed by a code of ethics in line with the highest standards of human rights; comprehensive accountability structures, including the Policing Board and the district policing partnerships, which make the police increasingly accountable to local communities; a 50:50 recruitment policy which is making the police more representative of the community it serves; the re-casting of the special branch as an essential tool for crime branch, with a new leadership and new procedures that are becoming increasingly in line with the highest international standards; and considerably enhanced co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the provision to allow officers from each force to serve in the other.</P>
    <P>The success of this project to date is a tribute to the people involved at all levels, and none more so than the Policing Board. The board&rsquo;s members, individually and collectively, have provided the catalyst for change by driving forward the implementation of the Patten recommendations. The board deserves great credit for its efforts.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I regret that the new policing dispensation in Northern Ireland does not, as yet, enjoy the support of all political parties. The Government and Members of the House have on many occasions commended the SDLP on taking on the task of leading the process of change from within the new policing structures. It has not been an easy task and has involved, on occasion, physical intimidation of members of the party. However, as so often in the past, the SDLP has risen to the challenge and demonstrated real courage and leadership on behalf of the whole community.</P>
    <P>In the past six months, perhaps the greatest burden has been borne by Nationalist members <Col N="639"/>of the district policing partnerships, who have come under a violent and sustained assault on their democratic right to represent their communities. This is unacceptable and I am sure all Members of the House would join me in condemning all such acts of intimidation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that paramilitarism is a cul-de-sac for communities. This House will join me in urging all those with influence to recognise the damage that paramilitarism, whatever the origin, causes to communities and to bring an end to all illegal activities.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, following the alleged abduction of a man in Belfast on 20 February, meetings on the review of the Good Friday Agreement have focused primarily on paramilitary activity, including the meeting on 23 February when I represented the Government. However, the two Governments are determined to see continued momentum in the review process, which we believe provides an important opportunity for sensible course correction, to put right any deficits of implementation and to renew the fresh start the Agreement envisaged.</P>
    <P>To this end, last week both Governments wrote to the parties, requesting them to submit by 8 April further proposals about the operation of the Agreement which they would like to discuss as part of the review process. In particular, we would welcome proposals from the DUP on strands two and three. The two Governments and the other parties will need to consider the totality of the DUP proposals before forming a judgement as to whether they are likely to provide a basis for consensus support. Both Governments will, in the light of these submissions, make proposals for the timetabling of further review discussions.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the review process, the two Governments are involved in a round of negotiations with the parties in an effort to resolve the current impasse. As has been stated on a number of occasions in recent months, the outstanding core issues are the achievement of final closure in relation to all forms of paramilitarism from all quarters and a commitment from all the parties to the full operation of stable and inclusive political institutions.</P>
    <P>These institutions of the Agreement include the North-South Ministerial Council, which regrettably has been unable to meet since the suspension of the Assembly in October 2002. This does not mean that North-South co-operation has stalled. On the contrary, good progress continues to be made on the extensive work programme already mandated by the NSMC, and the work of the North-South bodies continues under interim arrangements put in place by the two Governments to ensure that these bodies can continue to discharge their important public functions. I look forward, however, to the time when the NSMC can meet again to re-energise and give new direction to this critically important <Col N="640"/>arena of North-South co-operation to the benefit of all.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>In my Department, I have seen at first hand the tremendous advantage of approaching overseas marketing from an all-island perspective, through the establishment of Tourism Ireland. Tourism is one of the world&rsquo;s most dynamic and important economic sectors. The fact that the Government has placed this key economic sector in the hands of a North-South body is an indication of our commitment to and belief in the potential of such co-operative effort. Tourism is an ideal candidate for the all-island approach and Tourism Ireland has been an outstanding success since its establishment in December 2000. The body took over all-island tourism marketing at a difficult and challenging time for the industry worldwide and is delivering excellent results for the island as a whole. It has a particular remit to help Northern Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry to reach its full potential and I am pleased to say that last year was a bumper year for Northern Ireland tourism, with a 15% increase in holiday visitors.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland is fully embedded in the strategic approach of my Department&rsquo;s tourism planning. Just yesterday, I addressed a major European tourism conference in Dublin Castle, organised as part of our EU Presidency programme. This international event also served to raise the profile of our North-South co-operation in the tourism sector and has been mirrored by a similar event hosted in Belfast by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland, at which its chief executive briefed delegates on all-island tourism co-operation.</P>
    <P>The overwhelmingly positive experience of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s success is both a confirmation of the strong economic and commercial case for North-South co-operation and an incentive to seek out and develop further opportunities. Such consideration is of course being taken forward at official level all the time, but I look forward to the opportunity for Ministers from North and South to re-engage in the North-South Ministerial Council to bring renewed impetus to the development of the North-South agenda, both in my Department, where there are possibilities in the sport area and in exploring potential elsewhere such as infrastructure, energy and higher education.</P>
    <P>To fully realise the potential that exists we need to get ministerial colleagues from North and South back around the council table and that requires the restoration of the institutions and the full and inclusive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The House can rest assured that both Governments are continuing their efforts with the parties to advance all opportunities for progress. I commend the motion, as amended by the Government, to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="641"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from all that has already been said this evening, I re-emphasise the need for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. The very real social and economic benefits which have been delivered through the Agreement, even despite the current unfortunate period of suspension, highlight the enormous potential for the entire island.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great priority to the work ongoing within the six sectors for North-South co-operation and within the six implementation bodies set up under the Agreement. This has been reinforced again and again for the simple reason that it makes practical and economic sense to ensure that the North-South Ministerial Council operates to its full potential. In 2002, legislation was passed by this House to ensure that the important functions of the North-South bodies would be preserved during the period of suspension. This legislation and its protection of the work of the bodies have proved invaluable for the people of the whole island.</P>
    <P>In terms of enhancing our economic potential, the work of the NSMC and the new bodies has been of particular significance. These focus, for the first time, on an all-island basis, on key areas for co-operation such as tourism promotion, transport and agriculture, with dedicated bodies established with specific responsibilities for issues such as food safety promotion, marine tourism and aquaculture, the development of the island&rsquo;s inland waterways and trade and business development.</P>
    <P>The bodies draw their board members from all areas of expertise throughout this island. Encouragingly, business leaders in both parts of Ireland were among the first to welcome the establishment of the new trade body lnterTradelreland and all the North-South institutions of the Agreement. They share the view that for far too long conflict and division have prevented us from realising the full potential of our island economy. There has been a tendency to work back to back, whereas now it is time to work face to face. Our infrastructure has been cut in half. As a Border Deputy, I recognise in every aspect of our economic development North-South co-operation creates potential for important synergies, pooling of resources and sharing of expertise.</P>
    <P>In what has been a relatively brief space of time, tremendous strides have been made on all the new North-South institutions. Prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in October 2002, the North-South Ministerial Council had met 65 times, beginning with the historic inaugural plenary on 13 December 1999 in Armagh. The council has held regular ministerial meetings in a range of sectors including trade, tourism, transport, environment, education, language, loughs, waterways, special EU programmes, agriculture and health and food safety.</P><Col N="642"/>
    <P>The work programme of the council, which is being taken forward by the two Governments during suspension, continues to be serviced by an innovative joint secretariat of civil servants from North and South, based in Armagh. Their work should facilitate an easy return to normal council activities once the Assembly is restored and the NSMC can meet again. In addition to the council, the six North-South implementation bodies have been up and running for over four years and continue to press on with their important remits, with major programmes of work in place in a range of areas. On the basis of the work and the achievements to date, we can rightly have high hopes about the potential which these relatively young institutions have in terms of tangible, mutual benefits for all the people of this island.</P>
    <P>Enhancing North-South trade and developing all-island business linkages and managing our shared resources are key remits of North-South co-operation. These fit sensibly into the new North-South architecture of the Agreement and are producing significant benefits for the island as a whole. Although the bodies have their origins in a political settlement, they play a vital function in the practical working life of the people of our island. Alongside the work being carried out by the North-South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland, the NSMC has also been concerned with seeking to facilitate mobility between the two jurisdictions. In February 2002, the NSMC published a study on obstacles to mobility between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This study focused on the very practical issues which have made it difficult, for people to move across the Border or indeed live in one jurisdiction and work or study in the other. These issues, such as taxation differences, pension rights, social security benefits, housing and health care can create great impediments and prevent the movement of people. This report put forward more than 50 recommendations that seek to remove such impediments.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the report, work has been undertaken to attempt to remove these obstacles where possible, and when not possible, to provide accurate and effective information to those seeking to move. A public consultation exercise was carried out to allow organisations and people working and living in the Border regions to comment on the report and its recommendations. From this it transpired that the greatest impediment to movement is a lack of information. Work is currently ongoing between the Administrations North and South to establish a website that will fill the current information deficit and provide people with the information necessary on issues such as banking and health care prior to undertaking a move across the Border.</P>
    <P>In addition to this website, departmental working groups have been established to tackle specific policy issues. These groups are currently looking at issues such as the mutual recognition of qualifications and access to health care. <Col N="643"/>Practical work such as this will facilitate the further movement of people on the island of Ireland and will in turn facilitate the work that has been begun by organisations such as InterTradelreland. Such movement should also bring with it increasing economic and social activity between the two parts of the island.</P>
    <P>This will also assist in overcoming the division which still exists on this island today. Division, like a weed, infiltrates every aspect of society and is self-reinforcing. It cannot be tackled purely through politics, through agreements of words. The only way to eradicate it completely is through actions, actions which repeated so often become commonplace, part of the everyday reality of our lives. Much of our business on this island is now being taken forward by North-South bodies. From the point of view of this jurisdiction, no new policy is embarked on without consideration of the all-island dimension. This is what partnership is all about &mdash; working together for common good. We will protect these gains and press on this important agenda, continuing to reap the benefits, both economic and social. However, we would have been foolish to witness all this tremendous progress with complacency or to expect that there would be no further challenges ahead. We were conscious from the outset that this was always going to be a long-haul process and we would have to be prepared for, and not discouraged by, setbacks along the way.</P>
    <P>As we all know, when times are tough, in politics or in business, the only way forward is to keep working and to meet those challenges head on. We must not underestimate the importance of the new institutions at this time. The current period of suspension should not cloud the fact that their record in the period since December 1999 can be a very real encouragement to us as we address our current difficulties. The process worked extremely well and the people of Northern Ireland supported it. They liked that local politicians, accountable to them, were taking decisions on matters of critical importance to their daily lives. Many important decisions were made by the Executive and the Assembly about hospitals, schools and roads. Even if there were disagreements with some of those decisions, the people liked the new dispensation and the potential that it held. It is one thing all the parties agree on, they all want to see it restored.</P>
    <P>The new North-South structures have also been building and strengthening mutual understanding and helping to defuse the tensions and suspicions between the two traditions on the island. Many important decisions were made by the Executive and the Assembly about hospitals, schools and roads. Even if there were disagreements on some of these, the people liked the new dispensation and the potential it held. There is one point on which all parties are agreed: all want to see it restored. The new North-South structures have also been building and <Col N="644"/>strengthening mutual understanding and helping us to defuse the tensions between both traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>We do not underestimate the challenges ahead but it is the business of Government to address problems and find solutions. Given the foundations on which we are now building and the commitment and determination of the democratically elected parties and the two Governments, we will, together, find a way through our current difficulties.</P>

	<P>I speak in support of the motion. It would be my wish and view that it should not be contentious. It was drafted by us not to score points, but to send a message. It is our hope that the message sent by this House would be united, direct and simple. We represent those who live in this part of the island. They want peace, progress and stability in Northern Ireland. They believe that the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to democratic institutions of government. They look forward to the day when an elected government in Northern Ireland will feel free to engage at every level with the people on the rest of this island.</P>
    <P>The people on both parts of this island voted for all that, overwhelmingly, when they voted for the Good Friday Agreement. As their representatives, it is up to us to keep reminding the participants in that process that the Good Friday Agreement has yet to be delivered. It is entirely appropriate that this week, as we approach the sixth anniversary of that Agreement, we should once again return to its terms. The message in this motion, addressed as it is to members of paramilitary organisations and their political representatives, and especially the IRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Official or the Provisional IRA?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is that it is make your mind up time.</P>
    <P>I will return to this theme shortly. First, I remind the House that we will shortly come to another anniversary. Soon we will remember the Easter Rising of 1916, a rising underpinned by a proclamation that has gone into the folk memory of our people. Apart from the phrases we remember best, for example, the injunction to cherish all the children of the nation equally, that proclamation was noteworthy for some of its other instructions: the guarantee of religious and civil liberty; the promise of equal rights and equal opportunities to all citizens; the resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the nation and all its parts; and the solemn prayer set out at the end <Col N="645"/>of that proclamation that no one who serves the cause of the republic will dishonour it by cowardice or inhumanity.</P>
    <P>Almost 90 years on, we have occasion frequently to reflect here and elsewhere about the extent to which these promises and entreaties have been honoured. We know that we have not yet succeeded in this part of the island of Ireland in creating a republic that is genuinely informed by the principles of equality, freedom and solidarity at all times. We know that, in Northern Ireland, the cause of the republic has been dishonoured all too often by inhumanity. The thousands left dead, the families left grieving and bereaved and the injured and maimed of a 30 year conflict will always wonder what it was for. At some point, those responsible will have to reflect too. They will have to come to terms with a past that, whatever point of idealism or sense of injustice may have inspired it, descended far too often into sectarian carnage and featured far too often acts of inhuman barbarity. Those who started off prepared to die for the republic all too often tortured and maimed for it. The republic was dishonoured, and that must be faced up to by those involved.</P>
    <P>There is talk now of a reconciliation commission. No one should dismiss that idea lightly. Some have approached it from a deep sense of victimhood, and I fully understand that. Others have reacted to the idea as if to co-operate in any way with the notion of reconciliation would be to deny the values for which they stood in the past.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister has spoken of the need to move beyond the past and, while I sympathise with that aim, I fear it may never be possible until we have all come to terms with the past &mdash; the victim and the perpetrator, the gunman and the peacemaker alike. For all the people involved, truth is a necessary ingredient of progress.</P>
    <P>Issues such as what happened to people who disappeared without trace, whether there was collusion in the murder of loved ones and how do we finally get to the bottom of mysteries that have bedevilled the lives of those who suffered from them must be addressed as part of any process of reconciliation. It is not possible to effect a truce with the past while ignoring all its dark secrets. No one holds more secrets than the paramilitaries who claimed their mandate from our history and see themselves as following in the footsteps of those who signed the Proclamation of 1916. No one needs to confront the darkness of those secrets more than the same paramilitaries. It must, at some point, become clear to everyone involved that there must be a reckoning with the past.</P>
    <P>It is clear from reading the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in Members to the motion before us that we are not at that point yet. That amendment seeks to make it clear that all the difficulties in the way of progress now are the exclusive fault of other people. I have always accepted that Sinn <Col N="646"/>F&eacute;in members have worked hard and often courageously to become part of the solution. Some day, perhaps, it will be possible for Sinn F&eacute;in to accept that it was also intrinsically a major part of the problem.</P>
    <P>As well as dealing truthfully with the past, we need to deal truthfully with the present. I was shocked within the last week or so to read a newspaper story reporting that a close associate of and senior activist in the constituency of a Member of this House had been knee-capped and left along the Border. That story, to my knowledge, only appeared in one newspaper, but I find it astonishing that there has been a complete silence on the subject from the party of which the person concerned was an active member. One can only wonder at what internal tension caused this atrocity and why there appears to be so much anxiety to cover it up. The story may be inaccurate or misinformed, but that too should have brought a correction.</P>
    <P>We have arrived now at the point where it is, for the republican movement especially, make your mind up time. The prospect of progress in Northern Ireland is stalled for one reason only. An army which sees itself as undefeated but which declares itself to be no threat to peace is unable to dispense with its weapons. Until it can overcome that impasse, the long spell of uninterrupted political stability where democratic government based on the consent of the governed and is the central and only feature of all political activity will continue to be denied to the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in any spirit of recrimination. I am not here to score political points. We have all read and heard the attacks on the republican movement by a variety of Ministers. I have not joined in those because I do not have the evidence to which Ministers claim they are privy. I do not intend to be drawn into the debate concerning whether Mr. Adams was or remains a member of the IRA because, in a debate such as this, we should try to take a longer view. I want to see a post-IRA Ireland. Many members of the republican movement have said they want that too. The key to a post-IRA Ireland is in the hands of P. O&rsquo;Neill the mythical signatory of statements from the Provisional IRA. The undefeated army must come to the conclusion that it is in its gift to ensure once and for all that democratic politicians are free to go about their business, in this case the business of building a dynamic economy and a fair and just society in Northern Ireland, without ever having to worry again about the threat of violence from a paramilitary source.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Which army?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There must no longer be any room for doubt. If politics is the future, armed struggle is the past.</P>
    <P>I have before now praised the leadership of Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in for leading the members of that party on a long and arduous struggle down <Col N="647"/>the road of peace. All of us in this House have recognised how difficult a job it has been at times. Following the IRA ceasefire in 1994, there was general acceptance that the republican movement would need time and space to make the transition from violence to democracy. There was an understanding that the leadership was committed to moving towards full participation in our democratic system but that they would require time to convince the slower learners among the republican movement. Anyone who understands anything about our political history knew that it would take time and that there would be slippage and problems. However, all of us have from time to time bitten our lips. We have refrained from expressing the frustration we have felt at the slowness of the process. Too often it seemed to have been a case of two steps forward and one step back or, on some occasions, one step forward and two steps back. Too often it seemed as if the leadership of the republican movement was prepared to move only at the pace of its most recalcitrant member and too often it seemed that that slow pace was putting the process itself at risk. Let the republican movement now take the final risk.</P>
    <P>We will applaud the day that the entire republican movement has the vision and foresight to say that democracy is the only way forward. The republican movement ended 30 years of conflict with its military wing, the IRA, undefeated. That was its claim. Let that undefeated IRA now tell us, as clearly as it can, that the war is over. No one in this House or elsewhere will interpret such a statement as an admission of defeat. The republican movement has said again and again &mdash; I am prepared to take what its says at face value &mdash; that it does not represent a threat to the peace process. It has it in its hands now to provide a positive benefit to the peace process.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, but it bears repeating here, that a movement which describes itself as political, that has made significant political gains on both parts of this island and that is significantly represented in this House, in the Northern Ireland Assembly and in the Westminster Parliament, as well as a large number of local authorities throughout this island does not need semtex explosives. A movement which sees itself as pursuing democratic goals through democratic means does not need guns. A movement which sees itself as representing people, especially people who suffer through disadvantage, should surely have no truck with beating, maiming and terrorising people. A movement which is committed to the dynamics of political contest and which is seeking to build a strong political base in every democratic forum must not shy away from declaring that it is no longer at war.</P>
    <P>It is surely time for a new analysis which states that republicans and Nationalists derive strength and confidence from peace and democratic <Col N="648"/>involvement. The old ways, just like the old days, are gone. The only way forward now is through politics. Making politics work requires drudgery. Who among us does not know that? However, it does not require terror or violence.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the primary achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, namely, that it has brought a degree of peace, albeit flawed and imperfect, not experienced in Northern Ireland over the previous 30 years. There is still violence in Northern Ireland, much of which is perpetrated by the Provisional IRA. One death from politically motivated violence is a death too many. However, were it not for the Good Friday Agreement, many more people would have died. There is no viable alternative to the Good Friday Agreement and its commitment to equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these islands. The key now and the breakthrough we need to see is the recognition that the Agreement and its democratic framework is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>We must end the stop-start approach. We must remove the instability and uncertainty and, most of all, we must end the series of crises that have bedevilled the process from almost the beginning and replace it with stability and certainty. We have all said before in such debates that nobody can be allowed to take an each-way bet on democracy. One cannot choose to be a democrat on one day and then revert to terrorism on another. Stable Government in Northern Ireland and the full operation of all the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement demand that minimum degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>In the time since the Good Friday Agreement the world outside this island has changed beyond recognition. The motion before the House, for example, refers to the horrible atrocity in Madrid, an indication and a reminder, if we needed it, of the dreadful consequences of terrorism. Terrorism thrives, as we know, in polarised societies and in societies that have been denied justice and where there is no room for reconciliation. It remains the case that as we approach the sixth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement the central task of reconciliation in a divided community has still barely begun. I hope the last obstacle will be removed when the IRA finally declares that the only future is a political future and when the principle of consent is thus accepted across the entire community. That is the message from this rarely united House. Let us hope the republican movement is prepared to listen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion. As someone who lives within a few miles of the Border, I understand more than most the dramatic change which has taken place over the past ten years. I clearly remember the blown up and spiked roads and all the economic problems that created. I also remember that more than 3,000 people died as a result of <Col N="649"/>the Troubles. One cannot help but remember Enniskillen. The former Senator Gordon Wilson tried his best during his short time in the Seanad to encourage peace and forgiveness. One must also remember the terrible atrocity at Omagh when 29 people and two unborn infants died. Many people died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which happened almost 30 years ago &mdash; many questions remain unanswered about that incident. Only last Sunday my party recognised the life and worth of Billy Fox who served in this House and in the Seanad. He was the only Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas to die tragically during the Troubles.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward. It contained many aspects which some of us found difficult to accept, but it was a compromise. It allowed all prisoners to be released, despite many of the heinous crimes they had committed. Part of the Agreement was that there should be full decommissioning within two years. Many other issues were dealt with in the Agreement, such as the disbandment of the RUC and the establishment of the PSNI. We would like those issues to be sorted out as well.</P>
    <P>There is a new situation in Northern Ireland. The lack of progress means the two extremes are now in control. There is a major onus on the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to come to grips with the situation and not to allow the progress which has been made in the past ten years to deteriorate. I know from talking to friends in Northern Ireland that many young people, who do not know what happened 20 or 30 years ago, are being led into organisations. That is not in the best interests of either side or of the future of this island. I beg my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, with whom I have worked over the years, to do whatever they can, with the Irish and British Governments, to make the Good Friday Agreement finally work.</P>
    <P>I spent many years from the mid-1960s in farm organisations and during that time I travelled throughout Europe and, as chairman of the European beef and veal committee, I represented the Irish livestock sector. I met and worked closely with farmers from Northern Ireland and those involved in agri-business who came from all sides of the divide. It was a baptism of fire when I was elected in 1991 to the county council and the barriers were erected. It was more difficult to meet people from both sides of the political divide in Northern Ireland. Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was a member of that council. If an atrocity happened in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, it was impossible to achieve unanimous condemnation. We have come a long way since then. However, we must ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is finally implemented and achieves its objectives.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. I hope it will result in unanimity that will move the process forward for the sake of not just the 3,000 who died but the <Col N="650"/>many other people who suffered, directly and indirectly, as a result of those deaths.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We were discussing the simplicity, or not, of the electronic voting system. I have seen the advertisements on television and consider them a little disingenuous. I used the machine in Offaly County Council about two weeks ago and I had no difficulty with it, but it is not as simple as switching a light switch on or off or as using a cash machine. Deputy Carey spoke about ATMs, how easy it is to use them and how there has not been a difficulty with them. However, I draw his attention to the rising figures for instances of ATMs being targeted by criminals. Only last weekend there was an article in one of the Sunday newspapers about this. Criminals are able to get the information on the PIN card, put a piece into the machine and then use the person&rsquo;s ATM card. That should not be held up as an example of how simple, transparent and incorruptible the system is. Certainly, ATMs have proven to be corruptible. Figures released by the banking sector show banks are losing significant amounts of money as a result of fraud with these machines. They are not a guide and should not be used as such in this context.</P>
    <P>I found it simple to operate the voting machine in the council. However, there will be complications. There were three ballot papers for the town council, county council and European elections. One concern with the machine is that the writing at the top is difficult to see. It is yellow, digital style writing. When people press the yellow button a second time, whether through error or otherwise, they cast their vote and the decision is made. That happens quickly.</P>
    <P>Should the Government proceed with this system, what are the plans for informing people? It will require more than just the distribution of leaflets to every household and advertisements on television. I use the Internet every day and do my banking through the Internet but that is not the case with everybody. What are the plans for giving people information, particularly those for whom a leaflet will be an insufficient example of how the machine works? A significant proportion of the population still does not use ATMs, the Internet or e-mail. The number who do is growing but we cannot assume that everybody can use them.</P>
    <P>There will be complications when two or more ballot papers are involved. If the referendum is to be held on 11 June as well, I do not know how people will be able to read the four ballot papers on the screen. The machine was used in the last referendum in a number of constituencies but <Col N="651"/>voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; is different from voting for 14 or 15 names on a ballot paper. The capability of the machine in getting the result in either situation is different as well.</P>
    <P>The person&rsquo;s perception of the system will decide whether he or she will vote. The perception is negative at present. The Opposition is not to blame for this. We have a duty to oppose and expose when we anticipate difficulties, and we anticipate difficulties with this. The use of IT in schools is also relevant. The Taoiseach has, on a number of occasions, hailed Ireland as being to the forefront in the use of technology. I am not anxious to disagree with him on that because disagreement might reflect negatively on the country and I have no wish to do that. However, we must look at the reality and the relevant figures. The Taoiseach speaks about how far advanced Ireland is in the use of technology but we were unable to provide the technology for this system.</P>
    <P>When discussing technology, it is useful to consider a recent OECD report which showed that Irish school children and their schools believe their performance is being held back by a lack of computers and laboratory equipment. Ireland is 11th of the 15 EU member states in the use of technology in schools and the ratio of computers to pupils. We should not, therefore, clap ourselves on the back in this regard. Our pupil-computer ratio at present is 1:11.5 whereas in Denmark the ratio is 1:3. How is the Government dealing with this? In the last budget &euro;20 million was slashed from the technology for schools programme. That is something that should be borne in mind. If we are to start using electronic voting, we must consider the issue of IT in schools.</P>
    <P>Many speakers on all sides of the House have spoken about going into schools and speaking to transition year and CSPE students. I asked earlier about the Government&rsquo;s plans for informing the people who will vote on 11 June, but what plans does it have to inform people in the education system about electronic voting and how to use it? Until now the best way to show students how our style of PR with the single transferable vote works was to explain the voting system from start to finish, organise a mini-election with ballot papers, voting, a count and a result. That shows clearly how it works. Will there be a method in schools to demonstrate the voting machine and how it works? That brings us back to the problem of not being able to see how it works when using a machine. However, we still must educate school children about the voting system. That issue must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The main concern with electronic voting is the result and its accuracy. Deputy Cassidy seems to be an expert on my constituency and referred to incidents that occurred there. I am familiar with some of the cases he mentioned. Two elections ago one of our urban district council candidates lost in the election by one vote. He had one vote <Col N="652"/>that was not stamped. It is true that no vote was stamped by the returning officer in a polling station in the Ferbane area of County Offaly in the last local elections and the entire turn-out in that polling booth was spoilt as a result. The people in that area did not go out to vote with the intention of spoiling their votes. We have been given no reasonable explanation for this happening. Obviously, the physical explanation is that whoever was employed and paid as returning officer did not do his or her job. However, all those votes were lost. In this case the mistake was visible and one could see what votes the candidates would have received. The result would have been the same in any event.</P>
    <P>There are flaws in the old system. In the Borris-in-Ossory electoral area in the last local elections the count lasted five days. It was the subject of a book, <i>Count, Recount and Petition</i>. It eventually ended up in court on a petition. What is important about this is that people could see the voting system as it was, flaws and all. When the election result went to court, every vote that was at issue between the two candidates was examined in the court challenge and the judge gave his opinion on each. The public could see each of the votes. If there are any such questions with the electronic voting system, we will not see as clearly what, if anything, went wrong.</P>
    <P>People seem to believe that nothing will go wrong and that the system is flawless. We do not know that, however, and that is the point at issue. Deputy Andrews referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today in which two computer experts write about the future of electronic voting and call for a rational debate on the subject. They refer to so-called experts. I am not an expert and the 166 Members of this House cannot be experts on everything but we still have a duty to inform ourselves and deal with the legislation that comes before us. The Deputy used the article as an argument for the proposition from the Government side of the House. However, one part of the article gave the reason for having a verifiable paper trail even though the experts claimed it was not needed.</P>
    <P>The question was asked whether there was a way in which any voting system, manual or computerised, could be made 100% safe from unwanted interference. There is not. If someone wants to corrupt the manual vote, then given a reason, they will find a way. It may be much more difficult to interfere with a machine, and the phrase used is that it would be a &ldquo;big ask&rdquo;, but it could happen and that has been acknowledged. That is why we need the voter-verifiable paper trail.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that a print-out will be made before voting commences, while section 11 includes a requirement that a print-out be made when voting closes. Section 12 includes a requirement for a print-out to be made before the inputting of postal votes begins. However, certain subsections specifically preclude a challenge to an election result on the basis of failure to produce <Col N="653"/>the print-outs required. What on earth is the point of having the print-outs if they cannot be used in a subsequent challenge to the election result? That makes no sense. We are including something that appears to be a safeguard but is not one because it cannot be used. The legislation clearly states that the print-outs cannot be used, which is questionable. The Minister of State should explain the point of this provision but I cannot see how he can say this safeguard is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is similar to Article 13 of the statutory instrument and section 47 of the 2001 Act in that it deals with the recounting of votes in the event of a challenge. Section 16 provides that all votes cast at the election shall be counted afresh. The wording of the section would be significant for ballot papers and so on, but I do not see how it can work with electronic voting. If all votes are to be counted afresh, will there still be a random selection? One cannot programme the machine to do the exact same thing with the exact same votes as far as I know, although the Minister of State should clarify that. I do not see how this section will be practical. It requires more discussion because it seems pointless.</P>
    <P>Part 3 establishes the commission on electronic voting on a statutory basis, but I see no prospect of the commission being able to examine the issues that will be raised on Committee Stage or that I raise, namely, the reliability, security, integrity and verifiability of the electronic voting system. The Bill does not state whether the Government will act on or implement the report of the commission. As it stands, if the Government does not want to, it does not have to bother doing so. That is how the legislation is framed, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>When the commission produces its final report, it will cease to exist. Instead of having a commission which can examine all the issues and bring other bodies which deal with elections together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, we will have a short-term commission. It is being established to ensure this Bill is passed and, to make people happy, it will appear independent. However, people will not be happy with it. For example, why has the Ombudsman been excluded when she is a member of the other three commissions: the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Referendum Commission and the Constituency Commission. The Comptroller and Auditor General is also a member of two of those commissions and he has also been excluded from this body. Why is that? They are independent people who have done a good job and have something to offer in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 29, which provides for the release of statistical information on the votes cast, is of concern to me. Deputy Carey was concerned earlier that I would be upset because the tallyman would be gone, but I will not be upset because I hope not to be tallying next time out. The Minister will be in charge of the release of <Col N="654"/>information on the votes cast. He or she will provide by regulation for the provision, at the conclusion of the counting of votes in an election or referendum, of statistical information on a specified proportion of the poll concerned, including detailed information on the votes cast and comprised in that specified proportion. Section 29(2) states that the format, content and extent of the information which may be provided, pursuant to those regulations, shall be such that the secrecy of the ballot is preserved.</P>
    <P>We are leaving this up to the Minister by regulation and, if we are honest, there is little discussion of such regulations. They are introduced and enacted. While I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories, I question giving this power to any Minister as it is undemocratic. Can he or she decide to pick certain areas where he or she feels that the old tally-style results or the results from particular boxes should be disclosed while the results of other boxes should not be? That is the power being granted to the Minister, which is wrong.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the means by which the information concerned is provided to persons and also provides that there may be payment of a reasonable fee in respect of such provision, which is a bit like the Freedom of Information Act trick. People have to pay for those requests and the numbers applying for information have come down. One can argue the merits or demerits of that situation but paying a fee to find out how an election was conducted or the results of certain counts in an election is wrong. Section 29 should be amended because giving such powers to any Minister would be wrong. I ask the Government in the interests of democracy not to proceed with the provision as worded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I was concerned by the new system but, as time goes on, I am being convinced by it. I may be fully convinced by the first opportunity to see it in operation.</P>
    <P>It is time we moved on. We should not follow the British way and be the last to change in anything. Anything would have been better than the old system in which I have seen many flaws over the years. This will be considerably more tamper-proof than the old system. I have gone to counts where up to 50 ballot papers from one box were not stamped and were ruled out as a result. I remember the 1984 Connacht-Ulster European election count in Bundoran, where there was a difference of 5,000 first preference votes in one recount. This system will be much better than the old system which may have had more flaws than people knew about.</P>
    <P>More reform is required, not so much of the electronic system but of the registration requirements for independent candidates. In a council election an independent candidate must get 15 people from the register of electors to register his name as a candidate. That number rises to 30 members of the public for a general election. That is unconstitutional and should be <Col N="655"/>examined. It is unfair that independent candidates must do this and, more importantly, the secrecy of the identity of those 30 people goes out the window. For that reason it is unconstitutional and I ask the Minister to examine this with a view to introducing legislation to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned by the ease with which votes can be registered. Previous speakers referred to personation. If the Minister of State looks at County Donegal he will see that before long the number on the register will be equal to the population. At that stage one will wonder if there is anybody in Donegal under the age of 18. The number on the register is way over what it should be. Certainly reform is required.</P>
    <P>Impersonating at polling booths is a big problem. One hears quietly, here and there, what is going on. It should be necessary for every person to have a photo ID at a polling station and to show it to the presiding officers. I am very much against a constitutional referendum. If we are to have local elections, European elections and a possible constitutional referendum on the one day and want a good turn-out on the electronic voting system, I suggest the screen should not be cluttered with too many ballots. The introduction of the electronic system would not be helped by holding the constitutional referendum as well.</P>
    <P>The lobby for a spoilt vote is crazy and I cannot understand it. Voting should be compulsory. The 30% or 40% who do not vote could change the whole political scene if they were unhappy with who represents them at whatever level.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with presiding officers in Donegal. Many of them have held such positions for 30 or 40 years plus. The new county registrar is ill-informed on the old practice of delivering ballot boxes to collection points after the close of polling. Directives that should have been given on the day of polling were not handed down the line to presiding officers with the result that they will lose their positions. They have not been told individually but they have heard through the grapevine that they will lose their positions. That is not good enough and somebody should go in and sort the matter out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Much has been said here during recent weeks about electronic voting. There is nothing I could possibly think of that would be new. However, there are a number of questions I want to ask the Government. There are a number of questions thousands of ordinary members of the electorate would like to ask if they got the chance to come in here.</P>
    <P>Electronic voting is a service which the Government is providing to the people and one they did not require. Certainly it is a service they did not want. Not a single constituent in East Galway asked me to make representations with regard to electronic voting. I did not have a single letter of telephone call on the issue. The service <Col N="656"/>will eventually cost &euro;60 million. The easiest way it sits on people&rsquo;s minds is that it is equivalent to four Punchestown projects rolled into one. We know the reaction we got to the &euro;15 million spent on Punchestown and the evaluation that went into that project. We are aware of the feedback from the public to all the Ministers but they did not learn from it. I will return to that issue in a moment.</P>
    <P>Who wants electronic voting? We will go through the matter to see who actually wants it. What effect has electronic voting on the image of Ireland abroad? I heard the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government speak on this topic a couple of weeks ago. He said it was a new step in technology and that it would be great for our image abroad. Let us take a look at what exactly it would or would not do. What losses would be incurred by the loss of inward foreign investment if we never moved to electronic voting? We would not lose a penny. If we take the path of electronic voting will there be fewer holiday makers in Ireland in 2004? It would not make any difference. Would what we are doing with electronic machines have any effect on interest rates on the continent? I do not think so. I cannot understand the international significance. I heard the Minister speak on this a couple of times in the House and I am mystified as to from where he can draw that conclusion.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-up about electronic voting in the sense that I have been a Member of this House a long time. I will shed few tears for the tallying system and for hanging around for 12 hours waiting to see the outcome. As the years go by, the statistics clearly show that as a percentage of those eligible to vote, fewer people are doing so. That phenomenon is not new to most other countries.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If a Government wanted to get behind the reasons people do not vote, would it not be better to use part of that &euro;60 million in a different way? I shall suggest some of the ways it could be done in a moment. We are getting to the stage where almost half the electorate do not vote. I have my views as to why they do not vote. In certain parts of the country and in parts of Dublin the number voting is less. I see no effort being made by the Government, or most other Governments, to try to discover the specific underlying reason they do not vote. Do not try to tell me the introduction of an electronic machine at the polling station in Mountbellew will ensure more people come out to vote. That will not happen. I have anecdotal evidence that suggests that a certain section of the people will have difficulty coming to terms with this system, although I appreciate that if they go to the polling station they will not have much trouble with it. The fear of the unknown is the problem. We will lose a cohort of people who always regarded voting as an important civic duty. Many of the elderly have told me they will not vote because they think it is very difficult. If that <Col N="657"/>is all we get out of electronic voting, someone has got it awfully wrong.</P>
   
    <P>There is a more sinister reason for those electronic machines. They will be like mushrooms all over Ireland on 11 June. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is on an ego trip. He is not without a certain number of ego trips and is given to them when he gets going. They feed into a Government that has become arrogant. If a Government has spent 17 or 18 years of the past 20 years in Government, arrogance comes naturally. It comes from the belief that the Government can do what it likes, when it likes, and take less notice of the people than normal. When the Minister for Finance was asked about the controversy surrounding the now famous Punchestown centre, he replied in typical fashion that it was a fine building. This was as much as to say he could not give a hoot what others thought, but that he and the Minister for Agriculture and Food believed it was a good idea. Whether the project was well evaluated, they went ahead with it.</P>
    <P>At the local elections on 11 June, many voters will stand back and decide that the Government needs to be taught a lesson. Given a combination of factors, including electronic voting, many, including those normally supporting the Government parties, may stay at home, although I do not believe they will change sides dramatically. This will hit Fianna F&aacute;il. When a party is in power for so long, the objectives and principles for which it stood &mdash; I accept that Fianna F&aacute;il has done much good for the country &mdash; become blurred, particularly when the economy is doing well.</P>
    <P>The question of value for money is beginning to be blurred by the Government. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am regularly made aware, through the good offices of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that every single Department appears capable of losing millions of euro unnecessarily and speedily. In an economy using modern technology and counter-balances, this should not happen. It only does so because of the arrogance which has entered this Government and which it is now difficult to remove. Electronic voting has become caught up in this but if the public sees this as I do, Fianna F&aacute;il will get an answer on 11 June which it does not expect.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Government handled other aspects of this issue so badly. Any change in voting procedure is fundamental to the way people think and act, in Ireland and all over the world. We in Ireland have reached a stage where the people are so used to elections that contempt for the process is bred, and many do not vote. It has been pointed out in this debate that one could only look in awe at the situation in emerging nations where people would walk miles through the bush and wait long hours to vote. While we have moved a long way from that, ingrained in the minds of the people is a fundamental value for their vote &mdash; they do not <Col N="658"/>vote lightly, as we know. It is the business of Members to try to get the people to vote for us, but when they vote, they do not like to think there has been any messing around with a system they are used to and which, for all its faults, was, by and large, regarded as fair.</P>
    <P>I have no idea how electronic voting will work, and I think no other Member has either. However, the method by which it was to be implemented left much to be desired. Many feel that the Government should have had an independent process from which politics was removed. That this was not the case was a fundamental blunder which, again, is connected to the Government&rsquo;s arrogance. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government believes he can walk on water &mdash; a dangerous assumption. Given that many accept that electronic voting may work &mdash; I accept it has worked elsewhere &mdash; why did the Government not remove politics from this process and appoint an independent electoral commission? It appointed a half-hearted commission only after uproar among the media and Opposition. The tactician behind this got it wrong if he or she thought the public would accept that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the main mover of this ego-trip which he believed would be his legacy, could decide one day to introduce electronic voting and, the following day, be selected as Fianna F&aacute;il director of elections.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people with no great interest in politics reacted with huge suspicion, as might have been expected. I have heard said by some who are not in any way dyed in the wool politically that this is a throw-back to the times when Fianna F&aacute;il tried to get rid of proportional representation. I have been around long enough to remember the 1959 and 1968 referenda, although they took place a long time ago and a whole generation know nothing of them. However, on the days of the referenda, Fianna F&aacute;il won the other votes run in conjunction with them &mdash; one was a presidential election &mdash; but lost the votes on proportional representation. There is a correlation between those instances and the current thinking of the people.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with those appointed to the commission as they have great experience and expertise. However, I question why the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman were not included. It would have been just as easy to ensure they were, and the Government would have covered all options if it had appointed them. That they were not appointed leaves the sneaking suspicion that the commission was set up for one reason, to try to get over the people&rsquo;s lack of trust in electronic voting. Although it seems likely the Government will drive this measure through the Oireachtas, whether it is good for Ireland and its democracy is another question. If the elderly tell me they will find it difficult to vote because of their fears of <Col N="659"/>voting machines, one cannot say where this will finish.</P>
    <P>On the issue of value for money, it must be asked whether we could better spend &euro;60 million on behalf of taxpayers. The Minister first introduced this with a price tag of &euro;30 million, which then rose to &euro;50 million. Given the experience in this country, we can rest assured that the cost will be 50% higher than the original baseline figure, which happens in regard to roads, sewerage and otherwise. There is no reason to believe that by the time people start voting on 11 June, this will not be over &euro;60 million.</P>
    <P>The question is whether it could be better spent. The widows of Ireland would certainly think so and they would be right. The penny-pinching in their respect in recent weeks is nothing short of a disgrace. I went to the trouble of tabling a parliamentary question, as so many Deputies do in respect of many hundreds of schools. It concerned a school in Killeaney, outside Craughwell. All they wanted was a chance to build two or three extra classrooms and they were prepared to fund much of the cost themselves. The news from the Minister was that it could not be done. He said they were on band three which is a system in the Department of Education and Science which means it could be four, five or six years before the project is put out to tender. That is where the &euro;60 million could be used.</P>
    <P>I will not list all the problems in the area of health. Young married couples on low incomes cannot get medical cards for their young children. I believe the electorate will decide it got bad value and does not want electronic voting because it does not improve our country and certainly does not appear to do anything to foster democracy. It is an abuse of power.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more difficult to persuade young people to vote. This is a phenomenon which exists not alone in our democracy but in many others. A Government that is so interested in having people vote by electronic means should consider the evening of 11 June which is one of the longest of the year. I hope it will be a nice, fine evening. My understanding is that polling stations will close at 9 p.m. One would have assumed that they would at least be open until 10 p.m. to allow the cohort of people attending universities and institutes of technology or working in Dublin to return to Cork, Limerick, Galway and the provinces. It is difficult to leave Dublin at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and be in Ballinasloe before 9 p.m. to vote. I do not understand why 10 p.m. was not chosen, especially as 11 June is almost the longest day of the year.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that I express my opposition to the introduction of electronic voting. I am not against the concept but there are doubts about the security of this system. I do not understand why the paper trail has not been included to give an assurance to people who vote that their vote has been registered. We are <Col N="660"/>getting a bad deal in the form of a badly thought out proposal from a Government that has become arrogant. If this is all it can offer the people, it is on the wrong track.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this valuable debate. I note with interest that there has been great interest among the backbenchers on both sides of the House in contributing to the debate. It reflects more than anything else the affection in which the old system is held that the House has heard so many pronouncements of gravity both from the Labour Party and Fine Gael regarding the introduction of the new system. It seems that the people who are ranged against this proposal are a combination of those with the Luddite tendency and those who do not want to come into the 21st century and prefer the 20th century for a whole host of reasons. On the left-wing side of the House, it would appear that certain old Bolsheviks hate giving up the 20th century because, in a sense, that century was one of Bolshevism and socialism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and outlined the utter confusion that appears to reign in Fine Gael these days by saying he was against it. In recent days that same spokesman has asserted with abandon that he was right, and this is despite that, when given every opportunity to do so in this House, where it counts, to vocalise his discontent or objection to this measure, he sat on his hands and said nothing. He did not say he was against the smoking ban but proceeded to the bar and, in a moment of madness, declared that he was against the ban while he voted for it in the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy know if he lost his memory?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a class of self-serving politician in this House who discreetly leaks to the media that he or she is against unpopular measures, but I did not hear any word that Deputy Deasy had let even a word slip to the media which congregate around and outside this House. It would be surprising but is not in the context of a Fine Gael party that seems to be schizophrenic in its Christian democratic and social democratic wings. It seems that the party is riven by these two different instincts. Deputy Deasy is clearly on the libertarian side of the House. He believes in smoking if one wishes. Vote for the ban but smoke anyhow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of tobacco is far removed from the issue of electronic voting. The Deputy should go back to the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A level of confusion reigns in Fine Gael and it seems that party is being led by Deputy Rabbitte rather than Deputy Kenny. The former has entered into the twilight zone-type argument that is so appealing to the Green Party and other fringe left-wing parties on the issue of electronic voting. Deputy Rabbitte has resorted to his old stock in trade which is the grand conspiracy luridly painted up, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il will miraculously manufacture a majority out of this new electronic voting system. That is what the Opposition is trying to say. It is an insult to the intelligence of the electorate, not to mention the intelligence that resides on this side of the House. I do not think we could ever try to do such a thing.</P>
    <P>It is pure craziness but of the sort that, once on the Internet, tends to be believed by people on the green-left fringe who attend anti-globalisation marches, have gold credit cards and travel to Milan or Genoa to assert and effect change against the major capitalist conspiracies that exist in these world fora. When it comes to changing things at home, they sit on their hands and are extremely conservative.</P>
    <P>The defining point in our political system at present is where one positions oneself regarding electronic voting. It says a lot about one&rsquo;s orientation. There is now an intellectual and ideological chasm between those who are wont to <Col N="662"/>believe in conspiracies and way-out philosophies and ideas and those who wish to remain and live in the real world of real ideas and real change. That seems to define the difference between both sides of the House. People on the Opposition benches will oppose the use of Shannon Airport by American military aircraft but support it in another way, will oppose electronic voting but support it in another way, and will oppose the smoking ban but support it in another way. That kind of duality seems to be swimming through the system and I abhor it.</P>
    <P>There is no great conspiracy where electronic voting is concerned. It is a simple item of technology. It is noteworthy that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of our citizens, have already adopted this technology when booking airline tickets or spending hours on the Internet making purchases or shopping.</P>
    <P>People have long been used to ATMs, which have entered folklore. This technology is not new and people feel safe with it. It is noteworthy that when ATMs were introduced there was considerable suspicion that the cash dispenser would not count money correctly and people would be defrauded. Nowadays, according to the banks, hardly anyone seeks a print-out or statement of the balance in their accounts because they trust the system and are not suspicious.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Green Party, Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny and other speakers, people are not Luddites who claim there is a conspiracy behind the use of ATMs to which they are not privy or that banks quietly rearrange accounts when one withdraws money. The harsh reality is that the only way one can have money seized from one&rsquo;s account at an ATM is if a nefarious character sticks something into the machine to stop cash dropping into the box, a rather basic form of fraud. There is no fraud involved in the electronics or technology used in ATMs.</P>
    <P>Much of the brouhaha on this issue appears to be an effort by the Opposition parties to undermine citizens&rsquo; faith in democracy. This will not work because people are much more savvy than Opposition Members allow in their rhetoric and the assertions they use in debates.</P>
    <P>People are fairly comfortable with electronic systems. Cash accounts for only 6% of transactions in the economy of Iceland, with all others fully electronic. The increasing use of systems of electronic payments and transfers will result in such systems becoming the norm rather than the exception. While this country is rather slow in this regard, with most transactions cash based, younger people here are comfortable with electronic systems.</P>
    <P>The electronic voting system introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is very safe. One of the most nonsensical comments in this debate is the claim that the system is untried. It has been tried and tested in the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom and worked in all three. Its <Col N="663"/>introduction did not cause a major furore or result in a fundamental appraisal of the democratic system of these states. People accepted it and moved on.</P>
    <P>The system has also been tried and tested here, with 400,000 voters using it in the most recent referendum without a word of complaint. It is noteworthy that neither the Labour Party nor the Fine Gael Party made grave complaints or advanced conspiracy theories when the system was used in selected constituencies for the second referendum on the Nice treaty. No hue and cry was raised on that occasion.</P>
    <P>According to the coverage of the use of the electronic system in the previous general election, the only hue and cry raised in this House at the time was connected to the typical civility and concern of Members for the plight of another Member, in this case former Deputy Owen. The only accusation that can be levelled at Members, one which is often made outside the House, is that we look after ourselves too much, given that the greatest concern expressed about the electronic voting system after the previous general election related to the plight of Nora Owen who, it was stated, received the result too quickly and found it difficult to deal with failing to be re-elected to the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>The nice, caring Minister has adjusted the process to make it less harsh and mollify those who raised a hue and cry about the inhumanity of the electronic system and the ruthlessness with which it spilled out the entirely accurate result in the previous general election. One will not be informed of the loss of one&rsquo;s seat by a sudden spilling out of the result and a quick count announcement. The Minister has doffed his cap to the Luddite tendency and slowed down the machine. He decided to give the Opposition what it wants, namely, slow motion politics, similar to slow motion football, where one sees all the goals being scored in slow motion, or the modern habit of Sky News, which produces an excellent service of showing the action replays that people love. The Minister is providing for slow motion results and possibly even action replays for Members who lose their seats. Is that not marvellous?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be no paper trail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard a great deal of misty-eyed romanticism concerning the count. It is constantly stated that the count is marvellous and highly mathematical, with polymaths being used to try to calculate which way the trend, vote, transfers or swing will go. Much of what has been said about the count is nonsense. Counts are not particularly scientific or accurate. My experience of tallies in the 1980s, for example, was that they were widely inaccurate and sometimes mischievous.</P>
    <P>Some activists in certain parties apparently wrote up the dire consequences of particular candidates not being elected to frighten their <Col N="664"/>supporters and settle scores. I remember some members of my party taking a vicarious pleasure in the fact that the RTE news bulletins led with what was obviously a wildly inaccurate tally suggesting the then Deputy Des O&rsquo;Malley would lose his seat. While there was no doubt the report was inaccurate, members of the party enjoyed the prospect of their ancient foe losing his seat, even if it was not about to become a reality. This sort of nonsense is turned into lore and people romanticise the old system in a misty-eyed way.</P>
    <P>There was nothing particularly humane, interesting or wonderful about the system. While it produced great moments and excellent television, I have no doubt the new system will produce as much drama, now that the count process will be slowed down and the machine will feed out its print-out of the counts in a slow, deliberate fashion. For those who like the old system, a small part of it has been retained in the new system.</P>
    <P>The electronic system is more efficient in tabulating, collecting and releasing election results for the public to examine and analyse. There will be plenty of analysis of swings on election night in 2007 and after the local and European elections in June. I suspect that the change will be similar to the difference between premier league soccer in Britain and baseball in the United States, where fabulous statistics are produced around the game. One will see lots of statistics with the new system and there will be no change in terms of the wealth of information that can be produced. These wonderful machines are more accurate. There will be less inadvertent spoiling of votes, although obviously a person who wishes to spoil his or her vote can still do so by not pressing the Cast Vote button.</P>
    <P>The new system is a marvellous improvement, which will also eliminate the terrible, long-standing problem of large overtime bills associated with contested results in constituencies in which counts go on for seven, eight or ten days. I believe my grandfather was involved in a count lasting 13 days. Former Deputy Briscoe had to wait for two or three weeks for a result and we had a long count in Cork during the previous election. The public is neither better off nor wiser as a result of long, slow counts in which people fuss over votes and whether ballot papers have been properly filled in.</P>
    <P>People confuse the electronic voting system with the mechanical system operated in America where a hole is punched in the ballot sheet. This method leads to significant problems, as we saw in the most recent presidential election in the United States, where every state has a different rule about what indicates a clear preference. None of this will feature in the electronic system.</P>
    <P>The daft practice of bringing in senior counsel to decide whether a preference is for Deputy Kelly, Lenihan, Costello or whomever will also be eliminated. It is about people making themselves important and is irrelevant. People are interested in results. As Jack Charlton once stated, it is the <Col N="665"/>result that counts. That is what people want from electronic voting, not all the messing that takes place.</P><?oasys_cl11.7-?>
    <P>The paraphernalia of elections and counts is attractive to political activists and enthusiasts, but outside the limited base of those with an interest in politics who go canvassing and so forth, all of whom are wonderful and committed people, there are few others major fans of the political process. People want to get the result so that the Government can get on with governing the country. Most governments get re-elected on the basis that they do not badger the public with reform, nonsense and drama and things they do not want to hear about and uncertainty of one kind or another. This system provides certainty. It has done so in Holland and Germany and in the UK to a lesser extent. We have used it ourselves and it is now time to move on to this system.</P>
    <P>We set ourselves a very brave target. This crosses both parties. I would not claim that my party has a monopoly on wisdom on this issue. The rainbow government tried to position this country on the cutting edge of the development of new technology unleashed in the wake of the Internet. We had a technology bubble and a &ldquo;boom-bust&rdquo; cycle there, but this technology is important and gives Ireland a leading edge. We must concentrate on that. That is a cross party issue and not a case of Fianna F&aacute;il versus the rest as is normally the case. It is simply an idea shared across all these benches that we must adopt new technology and we must move on to this new and exciting platform and the freedom it offers from the nonsense that went on in the past. There is a verifiable audit paper trail, despite the canard that has been flung out in the public domain to be believed by certain zealots.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Costello wishes to challenge the results in his area at the next general election, legally or otherwise, this wonderful machine introduced by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will give out all the results so that the Deputy can check all the individual ballots. Machines and new technology can come and go. The law and the Constitution are there to protect the Deputy from the awful experience of being on the brink of losing his seat and questioning whether ten votes have gone missing. The old system was much worse in this respect because it was arbitrary. The result could change from one count to the other. The new system will be absolutely scientific, one will know when one has lost his or her seat. If one wants to complain he or she can go to the High Court and blame the machine instead of the public.</P><Col N="666"/>
    <P>When sensible people lose an election they blame the public. Brian Farrell once asked a losing candidate in an election what had gone wrong, and the candidate replied that he simply did not get enough votes. That flattened Brian Farrell for a few minutes. That is the nature of politics and elections. If a candidate does not win, it is because he or she did not get enough votes. Under the new system the votes will at least be counted more accurately, so a candidate will know to the percentage point by how much he or she has lost an election.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>People have a difficulty with trust at the moment and that is the kernel of the debate. Under the old system, people could see the ballot boxes being opened and the votes counted. Man has put a man on the moon and has sent rockets to faraway planets. It should be within our expertise to devise an electronic system which is to the satisfaction of the people and which is transparent. The citizen must be sure the vote cast is for the candidate for whom he or she has voted. There is a perception in people&rsquo;s minds that the proposed system does not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a system has been put into place at an enormous cost of more than &euro;45 million. How can we afford this system when in my county, 21 people were on trolleys in hospital and people could not even get in to the accident and emergency department because ill people were clogging it up? People that needed attention could not receive it as they were on trolleys. These were ill people who had been assessed as needing a bed, yet there was no bed for them. I wonder where all this money is coming from.</P>
    <P>In my county there are vast areas crying out for development. Communities have put together some wonderful projects but there is no money to fund them. We are told that all the money that was earmarked for the west was not there. However, there is plenty money available for electronic voting.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed is very bad value considering that we have a system that works. These machines will have to be maintained and stored in a safe place when not in use. This will cost a great deal of money. They may only rarely be used in a five year period. That is surely bad value for money in an age of transparency. This is what is wrong with the Government. There are 200,000 people promised medical cards who have not got them and yet it can spend &euro;45 million on gadgets that we do not need. It is more important that the money be made available for special needs children, for parents who cannot bring their children to the local doctor because they can not afford to do so.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of electronic voting but if I speak against it I am classed as someone who is <Col N="667"/>living in the past. If people had confidence in the system and if there were safeguards built in, then there would be general acceptance of what is being proposed. We have heard stories of computer hackers interfering with the electronic system, neutralising the vote recording mechanism. We have all seen programmes like &ldquo;Mission Impossible&rdquo; where people can substitute one briefcase for another. Let us imagine a machine, in which electronic votes are stored, is transferred to a central computer. What would happen if someone substituted one machine for another? That may be simplistic but the reality is that people see potential flaws in the system. It could change the entire course of government here and people see it as interfering with their democratic will.</P>
    <P>One certainty besides death is that people know they have the right to vote. They can vote out a bad government if they choose. That is now being interfered with and it is seen as a problem. We are witnessing increasing apathy among voters, especially among young people. We do not need any more cynicism among young people. There are many things that can be done to improve democracy. We know from surveys carried out that there is a difficulty with registration. Many young people are unable to vote and it is more important to encourage people to register. We should find out how difficult is the problem in registering. If the same vigour was applied to those issues as it has been applied to electronic voting, we would have a much better democratic system.</P>
    <P>People also talk about the need for a proper audit trail. They do so not because they want to complicate the system, but because they want to be sure that there is proper verification of their vote. If that could be done to the satisfaction of Se&aacute;n citizen, there would be a very different outlook. Having been elected in my county using the manual system &mdash; let us call it that &mdash; I noted that it worked fine. It is fine when one is doing well. I was the first elected, which was fine, but I am sure it was quite frustrating for others who might have had more difficulty in getting elected. I know people talk of the cut and thrust of the present system and say, &ldquo;If it is not broken, why fix it?&rdquo; There is a great deal to be said for the present system. A point could be made for changing it if we could afford to do so.</P>
    <P>People believe the present system makes good television and entertainment. Why is it now being changed? This is the question people are asking because there is great mistrust in the body politic and great suspicion that the Government &mdash; it may well deny this &mdash; is rushing the introduction of the new system. People would like to know that when they press the button to cast their vote, it will accomplish what they intend to accomplish. <Col N="668"/>However, they do not know from Adam where their vote will end up when they press it. This lack of trust is based on the daily spoon-feed of tribunals, in which the integrity of even our leading politicians is being questioned daily. It is also based on the spend before the general election, in which the Government achieved a majority the people feel it did not deserve.</P>
    <P>Everybody is familiar with computers and we all know how one can change things around on computer. For example, one could change the colour of somebody&rsquo;s hair or the colour of the sky or the fields. Therefore, people are suspicious deep down that political parties will manipulate the electronic system in some way to suit themselves. Even if there is to be no deliberate interference with vote results, people fear errors may occur that could result in thousands of votes going astray. This is why people talk about a paper audit trail. They need reassurance that a hard copy back-up exists which can be checked to show conclusively that the choice they made is the one they intended to make and that it has found its way into the ballot box.</P>
    <P>One cannot blame people for wanting this reassurance and verification that the system is working. We would all like it. There are real fears that the system will not work. It would be very detrimental for the Government to ignore these very real concerns. Anything that could undermine democracy is not good. It is very interesting to note that there is a paper audit trail in some jurisdictions. People talk about the USA, which I suppose is the home of computers. Silicon Valley is where it all started. It is very interesting to note that the authorities there have major doubts about the electronic system and now use a system that produces a paper trail.</P>
    <P>People feel there is great secrecy surrounding the proposed system and that there is no proper transparency regarding how electronic voting systems work. This is feeding further cynicism and the suspicion that already exists. Why not make the systems available to the public so it can study them, test them and have experts look at them to determine how they could be improved? This would involve a public consultation effort that would allow people to comment on the properties of the systems and their potential for abuse.</P>
    <P>People also state that source codes are held secretly. As I stated, in this age when we can do so much we should surely have a transparent system in which source codes do not have to be held by private companies. There is a suspicion that private companies equate with big business, big money and the manipulation of the system for private gain. Governments might state this is nonsensical but it is a very real perception, which would be confirmed if one conducted a survey. Where the electorate is concerned, the <Col N="669"/>Government must be above suspicion, just as Caesar&rsquo;s wife must be above suspicion. It behoves Government to ensure that people&rsquo;s fears are allayed by proving that electronic voting systems cannot be manipulated by those who have the power to interfere with them.</P>
    <P>We all have computers and know how they can crash. We know how wonderful they are as long as they work, but it is a different story when they do not. Chaos can result. I am not happy that everything has been done to assure the public that the electronic voting system will work and that there will be full transparency. I do not believe there is full transparency.</P>

	<P>It is time for a change in the voting system. Irish youth are the best educated in the world. We are world leaders in the manufacturing and exportation of computer parts. We are number one in the world in modern technology, which is a great achievement. We will make bigger and better strides.</P>
    <P>I compliment all our primary, secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community schools and universities and ITs, in which we have been educating people to the highest standards. The men and women of Ireland, including parents, teachers and pupils, are to be congratulated on working hard together to ensure we can take our place anywhere in the world and be recognised as the best, most knowledgeable, visionary and educated people in the world.</P>
    <P>Tonight there are adult education classes taking place all over Ireland in all VECs. In County Longford, an exceptional and unbelievable number of people want to be educated and to proceed with their education. Young people are the future and have the brains. All they need is the wind of the word for any new project and they will pursue it themselves and make sure they master it and move on. Elderly people are quite capable and intelligent and are now educating themselves during the day. Retired people go to community centres and cannot get enough education.</P>
    <P>The elderly made major sacrifices to obtain the vote. Voting and democracy are important and politics is good for the people. I am an advocate of politicians and politics and believe the Irish are very knowledgeable. Not only do they know their politics but they also know their politicians.</P>
    <P>Politicians have done a good job for this country and the majority of them are creditable, honourable, hard-working, decent people. If one asks the people in any constituency what they think of their county councillors and town <Col N="670"/>councillors and anybody involved in politics in the different committees, they will be told they are all fine decent people. It is not true to say politics and politicians are not good; politicians are good. I compliment the Minister and Ministers of State in the Department who are bringing forward this new system, namely, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and the Minister, Deputy Cullen.</P>
    <P>It is important people have a say and that democracy leads the way. This Government is doing a good job overall taking everything into consideration. This Government is the best. The people should not take any chances and should vote Government candidates back on to local authorities. Democracy and voting should be number one, regardless of what people say about there being no problems if we did not have democracy or good government and about our not having to worry about where money would be spent. We have had the best five years in the history of the State thanks to democracy and to politicians.</P>
    <P>A speaker referred to entertainment. Politics is a serious business. Running a Government and a country is a responsible job because one must look after the needs of all. County councils and town councils are doing a good job. Many conscientious and serious people are involved in politics. Politics is a vocation for most politicians I know. They could be doing other things in life but they choose to serve their communities. Looking around the Chamber, I see a successful businessman who could devote his energy and time promoting his interests and business but is in this Chamber representing his constituency.</P>
    <P>It is time to move on and to apply electronic voting. The Oireachtas has been dealing with arrangements for it since 1999. It was announced that electronic voting would take place nationwide at the European and local government elections in 2004. The purpose is to improve the efficiency, accuracy and user-friendliness of election procedures and to eliminate the waste of all the spoiled votes which most believe are accidental in that people do not mean to spoil their votes but become confused and do so.</P>
    <P>It is important that our youth become more active in politics. Is this not a way to encourage them to become more active and to say to them that we are progressive and young-thinking and will conquer the world in all spheres, including education and business? We must send the right message to the youth. The youth of this country have been the fastest to adapt to all types of change. We are adjustable and have proved it beyond doubt. We adjusted to the euro overnight while other countries talked about it. We had no problem adjusting to decimalisation years ago. At <Col N="671"/>times I am amazed at the quickness, vision and intelligence of the people. When I travel the world, which I do an odd time, the Irish people I meet are leaders in their field. They are the people who had vision and dreams and the ability to put them to practical use. They were steps ahead of everybody else.</P>
    <P>Politics has been important, and will continue to be. This debate on electronic voting has taken place at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. I emphasise that electronic voting is secure, reliable and can be trusted by the people. It is important that, when a person goes to vote, he or she knows it is secret. Over the years there was much ballyhoo and talk about people trying to cod others by telling them they knew how they voted. The other night on television I saw a programme about two men living up a mountain, one of whom could tell how the other had voted to within five votes. I do not believe that. I want to see secrecy and that a person can be content that nobody knows how he or she exercised his or her franchise. That is important.</P>
    <P>There must be a better way of doing things in the 21st century. We acknowledge that in all other spheres, so why not do so in politics through voting? At the previous local elections, 24,000 people had their votes disallowed because of mistakes. That is sad. This voting machine has been successfully tested by a separate international testing institution, TNO Electronic Products and Services, in the Netherlands. It should not be possible to associate a vote with a voter. There will be a voting machine to replace every ballot paper and arrangements have been made to provide battery power back-up in the event of a power failure. Conditions should be in place on polling day to allow people to exercise their franchise quickly and peacefully.</P>
    <P>The right message must be sent out about the secrecy of the ballot. It is important we also send out the message that the privacy of voters is protected. It is a duty and responsibility in free elections that people have a right to vote. There is also a duty on people to vote. Let us send out the right message; let us change and do what the people want. In recent years, the people have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the majority understand and react to change. We have changed in every way, so now let us change our voting system. The experience of electronic voting to date has been a good one depending on which side one is on.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I appeal to everybody to put democracy, the people, change and the youth first. Everyone says we need more people to vote and more people involved in politics, which we do. Sadly, when we look around the world, we see that democracy and politics are the only way forward. We must have <Col N="672"/>dialogue, compromise, respect other people&rsquo;s viewpoints and listen to all our people, regardless of whether we have the one aim. However, we in this House all have the one aim, that is, to promote the people and Ireland and to make sure we have a peaceful, happy and contented country in which our young people can be happy growing up, where our teenagers can have the best education in the world and where our old people can live in peace and harmony and have a rest after the turmoil of life.</P><?oasys_cl11.7-?>
    <P>Electronic voting is important. A speaker said it does not make any difference internationally. I was flummoxed by that and do not know what to say to it. We are part of the international community. Ireland was the first country to adopt the Maastricht treaty. We have led the way in Europe. Although this is an island, we cannot be isolated. We must play our part, and we have done so.</P>

    <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to place my concerns on the record. I am saddened it is the third occasion I have had to come to the House for an Adjournment debate in recent months to talk about job losses in my constituency. I hope there will be a more animated response from the Government than I received previously.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, 1 April, Buckeye Ireland, an American company, manufacturing cellulose and operating from Ringaskiddy in County Cork announced it is to cease operations, with the loss of 83 jobs. This followed the announcement a number of weeks ago by the Ridge Tool Company in Mahon that it was to cease operations, with the loss of 66 jobs. This was preceded by an announcement by CG Services that it was to close, with the loss of 110 jobs. At the beginning of the year, the Jetmagic airline closed its operations out of Cork Airport. These closures represent a loss of almost 500 jobs since the beginning of the year. Many of my constituents were affected by the job loss announcements made in the nearby Schering Plough plant, Brinny, County Cork, and the closure announcement of Irish Distillers in North Mall, Cork city.</P>
    <P>What disturbs me is the sense of complacency on the part of the Government in regard to all these announcements. Cork South-Central, which on the surface is a prosperous constituency, has in the course of a short few months experienced major job losses. What is even more worrying is <Col N="673"/>that many of these jobs were manufacturing jobs. The decisions that appear to have accompanied the making of these choices do not seem to be the normal competitiveness reasons to which we sometimes hear business leaders and Government representatives refer. The reality is that these jobs will not be relocated in Mexico or China, but in Canada and Germany, where costs equal those in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government put in place special measures in respect of future employment in the Cork city region, particularly the Cork South-Central constituency, which I have the honour to represent in this House. It is not good enough to stand idly by and not even comment on or put in place measures that would give some crumb of comfort that the economy, even if it is in general good health, will somehow pick up the pieces of the job losses. These recent announcements, when added to the announcements in recent years, with which the Minister will be familiar in his constituency, lead to a sense of uncertainty, confusion and general unhappiness about the state of the local economy in Cork. I hope the response tonight will be better than the response I received on my two previous Adjournment debates this year.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to see a serious trend emerging. Trends can be responded to by either trying to put in place measures to stop such a trend or surrendering to them. The Government&rsquo;s response to date has been to surrender to the trend, which is no comfort to those who have lost their jobs in recent months. It is certainly no comfort to those of us who have a responsibility to make sure confidence exists in the local economy. I will look for some solace in what the Minister of State has to say in regard to the recent developments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The intended closure in August of the Buckeye plant, which manufacturers airlaid non-woven material at Ringaskiddy. is a disappointing blow for those who will lose their jobs. The T&aacute;naiste is conscious of the adverse effects of such a closure on the surrounding area, especially coming so soon after the recent job loss announcements at Schering Plough, CG Services and Ridge Tool Company. It is just over a month ago since the closure of Ridge Tool Company was debated on the Adjournment of the House.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste understands from the company that the reason for the closure of Buckeye is excess capacity in the airlaid industry worldwide, which has led to depressed sales prices and high unit costs, resulting in losses at the Ringaskiddy plant. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S will meet the <Col N="674"/>company next week and make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs and courses. IDA Ireland has met the company to discuss the pending closure and agreed to assist it in marketing the facility once it becomes available with a view to sourcing a replacement investor for the area.</P>
    <P>While there has been disappointing news in regard to job losses in Cork recently, there have also been a number of positive developments. There are currently 134 IDA Ireland-assisted companies in County Cork, employing approximately 18,000 people, which is an increase of over 20% in IDA Ireland supported employment since 1999. In 2003, IDA Ireland announced 11 new projects from overseas companies for the Cork area, with the potential to create up to 800 new jobs. Highlighting the continuing confidence in the region, four of these new projects were expansions of existing operations, some of which included significant research and development investment. In addition, seven new start-ups were announced during the year, which include activities ranging from manufacturing and international services to high value research and development based activities.</P>
    <P>High value added projects in 2003 included the &euro;35 million investment in research and development by GlaxoSmithKline, MA Com&rsquo;s investment in IC Design and Development, while ACS, TR Sensors, Schlumberger, Trend Micro and Transas will engage in high value software development, IT support and operations management activities. Recordati, with an investment of &euro;28 million and Altana, with an investment of &euro;70 million, will continue to expand the region&rsquo;s competencies in pharmaceuticals. New developments at Pepsi Cola and Minelab will include high value shared service and manufacturing activities.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland client companies in Cork undertook to invest &euro;55.9 million last year to develop their businesses and are being supported with Enterprise Ireland assistance packages of &euro;10.5 million. Some 25% of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the county took the form of research and development and assisting companies to develop new products and technologies to increase their competitiveness. In 2003, there were seven new high potential start-ups. A particularly welcome feature was that the more traditional food, consumer products and timber sectors performed well, investing approximately &euro;30 million with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland support packages of approximately &euro;6.3 million.</P>
    <P>The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes more than 1,000 jobs to be <Col N="675"/>relocated to County Cork. This move demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in Cork. If the Deputy examines the CSO website he will see that the number of people signing on in the Cork region has decreased over the past two years. I assure him that the State development agencies, under the aegis of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department, will continue to actively promote both Cork city and county for investment and job creation.</P>

    <sTitle>Schools Building Projects.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the issue of the building programme for Aghina national school, Macroom, County Cork. This project was scheduled to go ahead under the schools building programme 2003. It was one of 12 large scale primary school projects authorised to proceed to construction in 2003 and is the only one of the 12 that did not go ahead under last year&rsquo;s building programme. I wrote to the Minister and tabled questions about the school and was told that the building project did not go ahead because no cost savings could be achieved, a condition under which it was included in the building programme for 2003. No progress has been on the issue since then.</P>
    <P>I made the case to the Minister that there were savings made on the original proposal. The original Department estimate on 24 September 2001 was for &euro;729,281.68. Nine tenders were submitted and the recommended tender was for &euro;610,052.98, a saving of &euro;119,228.70 or 16.34%. The school is in a quandary as to what to do. As far as it is concerned, it fulfilled the criteria but it was not given the go ahead.</P>
    <P>It was told by the Department that it could proceed on the basis of the small school initiative but the problem for the school is the scheme has an upper limit of &euro;250,000, much less than the school needs. For several years this small school has been told that the only solution to its problems is a new two classroom school. The health and safety authorities have stated that a new school is required and the Southern Health Board has recommended that a new school should be built as soon as possible for health and safety reasons and that remedial work would be insufficient to attain the necessary health and safety standards. I am pursuing this because the people of this small part of County Cork have been hard done by and it is up to the Minister and the Department of Education and Science to find a solution.</P>
    <P>Last year, the position on the list for the schools building programme led the school to believe that it had a solution. It had gone through <Col N="676"/>architectural planning, planning permission and the tender process. Now it is back to square one and the school authorities and parents do not know what to do. The school cannot build what it needs with the amount of money sanctioned under the scheme for the 2004 building programme. The board does not have the finances for a new school building so I ask the Minister of State, who is from the same county as the people involved, to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give up on this matter because an injustice has been done and the people of this community are entitled to a new school, as was promised. They fulfilled the criteria and saved the Department money. This is a small amount of money in terms of overall Department expenditure and it should be released so the people in this small community get the new school they require for the health and safety of their children and because they were on the list for the 2003 building programme. I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the building of a new school in Aghina, Macroom, County Cork, in the immediate future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline on behalf of the Department of Education and Science the proposals for the provision of a new school building for Aghina national school, Macroom, County Cork.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science received an application from the board of management of the school requesting additional accommodation. Following an examination of the case architectural planning of the project commenced. The Aghina national school building project was listed in section 4 of the 2003 school building programme which was published on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie.</i> The intention was that this project would be authorised to proceed to construction during 2003 subject to significant cost savings and a review of the enrolment levels later in the year.</P>
    <P>Pupil enrolments were reviewed because enrolment levels had declined from 44 in 1996 to 28 by September 2002 and 25 by September 2003. The school has a principal teacher, an assistant teacher and a shared remedial-resource teacher.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of the project, the lowest tender was increased for the provision of a new building so that instead of a cost saving on the project, the price increased.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Education and Science met the chairperson and representatives of the board of management of the school on 16 December 2003 to discuss the enrolment position and issues relating to the proposed school building project. Department <Col N="677"/>officials subsequently visited the school on 19 December 2003 to review the condition of the existing accommodation. An official again visited the school on 22 March 2004. A grant of &euro;250,000 was offered to the school management to address the accommodation issue. The Department is currently considering a response received from the school management regarding the building project and the proposed grant and will respond to the board shortly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in this House and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>

    <sTitle>EU Enlargement Celebrations.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the Government&rsquo;s proposals to celebrate the accession of the ten new member states of the European Union on 1 May 2004 and to find out why the public concert planned for O&rsquo;Connell Street was cancelled.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the BBC and RTE should plan a concert in O&rsquo;Connell Street for months and only apply for a licence to Dublin City Council in recent days and that they should request traffic restrictions that would require the closure of O&rsquo;Connell Street for nine days. In such circumstances it would be difficult to organise a concert while minimising disruption to traffic and to traders. If something has been planned for months such considerations should be addressed at the preliminary stage but this was not the case.</P>
    <P>On 1 May we will welcome ten new member states into the European Union. This has been planned for years &mdash; it has been the subject of a constitutional referendum and much soul searching here. The new entrants will increase the number of states in the European Union from 15 to 25, a huge event. The Government should organise a major celebration to welcome the accession states. Why should the largest celebration be organised by two broadcasting concerns? I am concerned that the Government has not been more pro-active. Will we simply have the letter from the Taoiseach asking if we are interested in attending a lunch in Dublin Castle on the occasion? A lunch? To celebrate this occasion? That does not sound up to the mark.</P>
    <P>Already 10,000 people had bought tickets to this concert. This was not just done overnight, it was organised for months. It is extremely poor planning and the Government should take the initiative.</P>
    <P>Why does the Government not come on board anyway? O&rsquo;Connell Street is not the area for such a celebration, particularly with the Luas works that are disrupting the area. Smithfield was planned as an open air venue for large gatherings and concerts and the Phoenix Park is an obvious choice. The centre for a concert of this nature, <Col N="678"/>however, is Croke Park. We saw the success of the opening and closing concerts for the Special Olympics. We saw the quality of Irish and international musicians. Surely, we could have a fabulous combination of Irish musicians such as Bono, Westlife, the Corrs and Christy Moore putting on display the quality of Irish music, performance and entertainment in that fabulous centre before the 25 countries and with musicians contributing from the accession countries. I have no doubt Croke Park would be filled for such an event and it would have been a wonderful occasion and an opportunity to present the quality of Irish performance. It is not too late to do so yet and it should be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has indicated that a number of events will take place such as &ldquo;Vectorial Elevations&rdquo;, the world&rsquo;s largest unique on-line art work, to which I am looking forward, as well as a fireworks extravaganza and the national &ldquo;Day of Welcomes&rdquo; involving ten Irish towns and cities. However, what about the country&rsquo;s capital city? Surely, this is where the major celebration should take place in the form of an open air concert. May Day is the working person&rsquo;s holiday which, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, offers an opportunity to celebrate the accession with an event in Croke Park. Let us have a new look at it and let the Government be pro-active about it this time.</P>

	<P>On 25 February last, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism gave details to the House in response to questions about the cultural programme being staged in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU. This extensive programme, which will see more than 250 Irish artists and hundreds of European artists presenting work across the expanded EU, including here in Ireland, is one of the central features of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>As he advised the House previously, it is planned that each of the ten new member states will be officially welcomed into the EU by an Irish city or town in a special &ldquo;Day of Welcomes&rdquo; on Saturday 1 May. The participating towns and cities are Bray, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Killarney, Galway, Sligo, Letterkenny, Drogheda and Kilkenny.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This day will be part of the national celebrations that will involve each of the ten towns and cities hosting distinct and engaging European fairs. From 22 April running through until 3 May, there will be a presentation of &ldquo;Vectorial Elevation&rdquo; &mdash; the world&rsquo;s unique largest on-line artwork. Twenty-four searchlights will be located on and over the buildings in <Col N="679"/>O&rsquo;Connell Street. Every six seconds, from dawn to dusk, a new design will be rendered on the sky for all to see while a large screen will display the signature and comments of the author. A fireworks extravaganza in Dublin from a leading European pyrotechnics company will commence celebrations in the capital on Friday, 30 April.</P>
    <P>Dublin will also see Merrion Square transformed into a colourful bazaar with marquees, stands and stages making up the European fair on Saturday, 1 May. It is anticipated that of the order of 100,000 visitors will pass through the fair to enjoy the experience of unique and interesting produce from the new EU member states and participate in the cultural activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House earlier today in response to questions that RTE, in partnership with the BBC, had been working on the broadcasting project entitled &ldquo;A Beautiful Night&rdquo; for many months. This event was designed to be one concert with two stages, with public performances outside City Hall in Belfast and on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin. It was RTE&rsquo;s intention that the concert should be broadcast live from Belfast and Dublin and made available through the EBU network to broadcasters and their audiences throughout the enlarged European Union.</P>
    <P>The two broadcasters who were responsible for the organisation of this concert made a joint application to Dublin City Council for a licence to hold the concert in O&rsquo;Connell Street. However, recently it became apparent to the broadcasters that there would be serious difficulties surrounding the traffic restrictions that would have to be imposed to allow the stage to be built in O&rsquo;Connell Street in time to allow full safety and sound checks, rehearsals and so on to take place.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council was not in a position to facilitate the broadcasters in this context, given that partial road restrictions would have been required for up to nine days in advance of the event. The Minister understands that the broadcasters were also advised of other restrictions that would have been imposed. These disruptions could have serious impact on travel and trade over the bank holiday weekend. Accordingly, the two broadcasters decided that, taking account of all the circumstances applying, it is not feasible to proceed with the event in Dublin. The Minister appreciates the reasons the broadcasters could not proceed with the planned concert.</P>

   <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children. It gives me no pleasure to raise this matter but I do so on behalf of Billy Burke and <Col N="680"/>his family. Billy is the same age as I am &mdash; he is 29 &mdash; and he has cystic fibrosis. He went to college and got a job but soon had to stop working because of his illness. He is now confined to his home in Killorglin and is on oxygen 24 hours per day. He was a regular outgoing man who now has a very poor quality of life. He is in a great deal of pain but is fighting hard to hang on. He urgently needs a lung transplant, about which the Minister is aware.</P>
    <P>Every day that passes rapidly lessens his chances of survival and it is literally a life and death situation for Billy. I have been aware of his position for some time but his family, and his sister in particular, to whom I have spoken, were extremely reluctant to go public on this issue in case it damaged Billy&rsquo;s chances. They have been trying to resolve this matter behind closed doors for the past ten months. However, time is now running out and they felt they had no option but this approach which they have finally chosen.</P>
    <P>My information is that until last week there was no lung transplant facility in Ireland. One was promised in the 1997 and 2002 programmes for Government and one has now opened and I think hopes to carry out two or three transplants a year. In the meantime, an arrangement was brokered by the Department of Health and Children between the ERHA and Freeman Hospital, Newcastle in which all lung transplants for Irish people are carried out, in return for which the hospital has exclusive access to all lungs donated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that we now have a lung transplant facility and I hope it can soon proceed to carry out the greatest number of operations possible. Unfortunately however, that facility has come on stream too late for Billy and approximately six other people, including another young man who sadly passed away. Billy has been waiting for a transplant for the past three and a half years. Newcastle turned him down in February 2003 because of a particular infection in his lungs which is not uncommon in people with cystic fibrosis. In June 2003, however, another English hospital in Manchester agreed to carry out the transplant if it could get a suitable lung from the Irish pool.</P>
    <P>This is not about queue-skipping or a clinical decision because Newcastle made a different clinical decision to that made in Dublin and Manchester. I understand there will be a review of this agreement in two weeks&rsquo; time and I wonder how long it will last. Either way, it will be too late for Billy. This agreement has worked for some but not others. The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland asks that Irish organs be made available to Irish patients, irrespective of where the transplant takes place.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about numbers or waiting lists and I am sure the Minister is always <Col N="681"/>conscious that we are talking about real people. This is about a real person. I am asking the Minister to tell me and Billy&rsquo;s family what can be done to save his life. Billy told me yesterday that he could not believe he could be left to die because lungs can be sent to one hospital but not to another. I do not see the logic in this. I do not know if I can have done justice to how Billy and his family feel &mdash; the sense of frustration, anger and helplessness despite knocking on every possible door. Billy must value every day and hour because he does not know how long he has left. What can the Minister for Health and Children and his Department do?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue this evening.</P>
    <P>I am aware of this critical medical case and have every sympathy with Billy Burke and fully share the concern that he obtain a lung transplant as soon as possible. I understand that the case which the Deputy raised has been the subject of extensive contact between the Department, members of the person&rsquo;s family and the patient&rsquo;s consultant at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have been in touch with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Health and have been advised that the person concerned has been placed on the waiting list at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester and is awaiting a suitable donor. I have also been in contact with his physician in the Mater Hospital on this matter. The patient was previously listed for transplantation at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. It is clear that everything possible is being done by all concerned to ensure that Mr. Burke can receive a transplant.</P>
    <P>Decisions relating to the management of a patient&rsquo;s care are appropriate to the relevant clinical personnel involved, both here in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. Patient selection for transplantation is a matter of clinical judgment irrespective of whether the procedure is to be performed in the United Kingdom or in this country at the new lung transplant unit at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline the background to the service agreement with the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. The agreement was put in place in 1999 to improve the level of access for Irish patients requiring transplants, which at that time was considered extremely poor. Few patients were receiving transplants despite undergoing numerous trips to various UK centres for assessment with the associated stress and inconvenience to the patients and their families that this involved.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangement with Newcastle, the Republic of Ireland became part of a designated zone in the UK for lung donation purposes, thus <Col N="682"/>increasing the potential number of organs available to that zone. This has been a significant factor in increasing the number of transplants for Irish patients in recent years. There have been 42 since 1999 with 12 performed in the last year alone. Prior to the agreement with Newcastle, an average of three transplants per annum were being performed on Irish patients. It is evident, therefore, that the service agreement with Newcastle has resulted in a major improvement in the level of the service available to Irish patients. The objective in establishing an Irish-based programme is to increase further the access of all Irish patients to lung transplantation while, at the same time, ensuring that the clinical outcomes for these patients are at least as good as those obtained in established centres elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The service agreement with Newcastle provides for the retrieval of donor lungs by a team from the Freeman Hospital. The donated organs are managed through a central pool along with the donated organs from the United Kingdom centres within the zone or region. Irish patients awaiting a transplant are placed on a common waiting list for the zone along with patients from the United Kingdom. Transplants are carried out on patients, including Irish patients, on the common waiting list using available matched organs from the pool regardless of their place of origin.</P>
    <P>The decision to carry out a transplant operation is taken having regard to a number of factors, including the availability and matching of the organ donated and the clinical urgency of those waiting. Newcastle does not have exclusive rights to lungs donated in Ireland but has a first call based on suitability. Lungs not required by Newcastle may be offered to other centres in the United Kingdom, including Manchester. There is no obstacle, therefore, to the use of lungs donated in this country by other transplant units in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The lung transplant unit at the Mater Hospital was recently opened by the Taoiseach. International experience indicates that the rate of lung donation in Ireland is likely to increase once the national programme is up and running. In particular, the proximity and interaction of the retrieval and transplant teams has been shown to maximise the retrieval rate. As the Irish programme develops, it will be necessary for the existing arrangements for donor lungs retrieved in this country to be re-examined, and this will be an issue for discussion at the next service agreement review meeting between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Freeman Hospital, which has been scheduled for 16 April.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done by all involved to facilitate the provision of a lung transplant as soon as possible for Mr. Billy Burke. Officials of my Department, my adviser and I <Col N="683"/>have had discussions with a number of people on this matter. I share the frustration of the family and I understand their anxiety to have this matter brought to a successful conclusion and a transplant operation carried out.</P>
    <P>The agreement we entered into with Newcastle has been beneficial to a broad number of people and it has been better than the previous situation. <Col N="684"/>Patient selection must continue to be a matter of clinical judgment, whether in Newcastle, Manchester or the Mater Hospital. We will continue our efforts to secure a transplant for Mr. Burke. I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s articulating the issues as clearly as she has done.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of tourism on an all-island basis is one of the great success stories of the northern peace process, particularly the contribution it has made to the enviable performance of the tourism sector on the island of Ireland relative to our international competitors.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening a very successful international event took place in Belfast to showcase all-island tourism. Over 30 international policy-makers from over 25 countries participated at the event, which was part of our centrepiece Presidency Conference on Tourism, which took place in Dublin. The reaction from this international audience was extremely positive and confirmed my own belief as to the merits of this ambitious initiative.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a cornerstone of economic growth, employment generation and regional development on the island of Ireland. In the South, the sector is now a &euro;5 billion industry providing 12% of employment and representing 4.4% of GNP. Over the same period, visitor numbers to Ireland grew by an average of 7% compared to a world average of 4% up to 2000. While this trend stalled somewhat over the past three years, the most recent figures for 2003 show positive signs of recovery with a return to 5% growth in overseas visitor numbers.</P>
    <P>For Northern Ireland, the story has been similar in many ways, particularly in terms of its appeal as a tourism destination and the significant investment from public and private sources in the development of a quality tourism product. It is also evident, however, that its international <Col N="686"/>perception as a tourism destination was being impeded by the negative images being broadcast around the world as a result of the conflict between the two communities. This impediment was lifted through the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, which was concluded almost six years ago to the day.</P>
    <P>While co-operation in many forms was already under way in the tourism sector, the Good Friday Agreement gave a vital impetus to both Administrations and the sector as a whole to work even closer together. A key synergy was, and remains, the presentation of an integrated and cohesive image and message internationally in regard to the island of Ireland as a tourism destination. It was in this context that Tourism Ireland was formed as an all-island international marketing company, with its staff, expertise and intellectual property drawn primarily from the two tourist boards.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s mandate is to grow overseas tourism business to the island of Ireland and support Northern Ireland to realise its tourism potential. In that context, it is responsible for overseas destination marketing of the island of Ireland. In delivering on this mandate, it works very closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the tourism industry on the island and overseas. In its first two years in existence, Tourism Ireland has succeeded in becoming a serious player in a very competitive international marketplace.</P>
    <P>North-South co-operation on tourism matters now operates at many levels. At policy level, myself and my northern counterpart oversee and approve objectives, strategy and resources for Tourism Ireland. This co-operation cascades through both public sectors through the active liaison and co-operation of both sponsor Departments on a range of issues and through the co-operation and liaison of the three bodies &mdash; Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Northern Ireland Tourist Board. This co-operation is mirrored in the private sector, at one level through the industry representation on the board of Tourism Ireland but also through the close working relationship of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Northern Ireland Tourist Industry Confederation.</P>
    <P>Despite the unfavourable market conditions for tourism internationally over recent years, overseas tourism to the island of Ireland has performed remarkably well, increasing by 2.4% in 2002 and by an estimated 5% in 2003 to an estimated 7.4 million overseas visits. The year 2003 proved to be a particularly good one for Northern Ireland with visitor numbers estimated to have increased by in excess of 11%.</P>
    <P>The development of a cohesive and well-targeted message in regard to the appeal of the island of Ireland as a quality tourist destination <Col N="687"/>has been a key factor in delivering this performance. In the design and roll-out of their marketing programmes, further opportunities for co-operation and cohesive action are emerging which can optimise the clear synergies which exist between the various stakeholders in this vital sector of both the Northern Ireland and southern economies.</P>
    <P>A particular challenge in the immediate future will be to bed down the new structures and ensure clarity of focus and responsibility for each of the bodies concerned. Regardless of the political context for such co-operation, in the final analysis, this project will stand or fall on the basis of its capacity to deliver dividends to its stakeholders, particularly the tourism industry, in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>On that score, Tourism Ireland has proven a real and tangible success to date and I am confident that, working with the industry and the tourist boards, it will go from strength to strength.</P>

    <P>The staging of an alternative television event on 1 May is a matter for RTE. However, the series of events being organised by my Department around the country to celebrate the accession of the ten new member states will go ahead as planned. These include &ldquo;Vectorial Elevations&rdquo;, one of the most unique and the world&rsquo;s largest on-line artworks, a fireworks extravaganza, a European fair in Merrion Square and the national &ldquo;Day of Welcomes&rdquo; involving ten Irish towns and cities each of which will specially welcome a particular accession state.</P>

	<P>There is no doubting the economic importance of film, of the fact that film employs many people, and attracts inward investment in the form of international <Col N="689"/>production finance. All of these things are very important and bring great benefits. Additionally, from my perspective as Minister with responsibility for the arts, film is much more than that. The primary motivation for our support of film is that film is worth having as part of our culture, as a unique medium for the expression of our Irish perspective, for its own sake.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board, funded by my Department but independent of it, is responsible on a day-to-day basis for promoting the Irish film sector. The board operates a multilayered approach, often giving film makers and script writers their first access to the business, but also seeking to advance and assist the work of more established professionals.</P>
    <P>Among the board&rsquo;s objectives going forward are: to strengthen project development and production, both artistic and commercial; to develop dynamic and financially strong production companies; to raise and enhance the profile of the Irish film industry, both nationally and internationally; and to position the indigenous industry at the forefront of new technologies. I am glad I was able to secure an increase in funding for the board of over 9% for 2004, which will make a real difference to the its capacity to serve and assist the industry.</P>
    <P>The other major strand of State support for film is through the section 481 scheme for investment in film production. This relief has now been extended to 2008, with the amount that may be raised increasing to &euro;15 million from 2005 and is particularly important for our capacity to attract international productions to Ireland, and these productions, particularly the bigger productions, bring real economic benefits to Ireland, as well as giving our personnel the chance to develop their skills and their careers.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my response of 25 February 2004, reference 6106/04, an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, is currently under way and is due to be completed by the middle of this year. The position in regard to private sector involvement in the programme is being considered in the context of that review. As part of the review process, the work of the interdepartmental working group, which was set up in 1999 to advise on the key issues in regard to the operation of a public private partnership, PPP, approach in regard to swimming pools, will be taken into account. The experience of local authorities, national legislative and policy developments in the area of PPPs will also be pertinent.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the various arrangements and accompanying guidelines in place for PPPs are geared towards major and complex capital projects with significant ongoing maintenance requirements, that is, projects having a capital cost of &euro;20 million or more and the advice is that the PPP model should only be used where it is appropriate and where it can deliver value for money. Conversely, it would not be appropriate where the transaction costs of pursuing a PPP are disproportionate to the value of the project. The policy framework for PPPs in the local government sector issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in November last and implementing guidelines from the Department of Finance are detailed and complex in implementation terms. The scale of project costs in the LASPP are in the region of &euro;8 million and would not be seen, therefore, as being of sufficiently high cost to <Col N="691"/>justify the extra resources involved in pursuing a formal PPP approach. The Department of Finance confirmed some time ago that there were several considerations which would militate against a PPP approach in this programme and that pool projects do not strictly comply with the definition of a viable PPP in terms of scale and optimal transfer of risk to the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the LASPP is merely a grant scheme and it is a matter for local authorities to devise funding and operational arrangements as they see fit to complement the grant element. Experience shows that there is potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of local authority swimming pool facilities and many local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects. From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, there is no objection to the involvement of the private sector provided the generally accepted operational considerations of a public pool form part of the project. These considerations would involve, for example, non-membership &ldquo;pay per swim&rdquo; access, concessionary rates as part of social inclusion measures, etc.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the expenditure review to which I referred, the possibility of a stronger private sector involvement in the provision and operation of swimming pools will become clearer.</P>

	<P>I am aware that, as reported recently at the launch of its 2003 annual report, the tourist victim support service dealt with a total of 357 cases of crimes against tourists last year. This was an increase of 4% on the 344 cases reported for the previous year. I understand that the majority of the cases, 188, were in regard to theft but, regretfully, some 22 cases involved violence against tourists.</P>
    <P>I deplore any increase in the level of crime against tourists, in particular as they are a vulnerable group away from their home country and without a network of family and friends to support them. For this reason, I applaud the work of the tourist victim support service and I am encouraged by the support and close co-operation that the service continues to receive from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge also the role the service plays in terms of providing top quality safety information guides for tourists and was pleased to be associated with its launch last year. I wish the service every success in this its tenth anniversary year. I would urge the tourism sector, and wider commercial interests that benefit from tourism, to fully support the service in its very important work both with tourists in crisis and in safety awareness.</P>
    <P>While any level of crime is unacceptable, it is important to have a sense of perspective. In a survey carried out last year, of cities in 215 countries, Ireland proved to be one of the safest destinations for tourists and Dublin was found to be the 18th safest city in the world.</P>

Five projects are at construction phase &mdash; the Regional Sports and Leisure Centre in Tralee, Clonmel, Tuam, Churchfield in Cork city and Ballymun in Dublin. In addition, 37 other applications are at various stages in the process, four are at tender stage, 18 are at contract document stage and 15 are at preliminary report stage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 270 together.</P>
    <P>Great Britain remains a key market for Irish tourism and is of critical importance to all regions of Ireland and all sectors of the industry. This is expected to remain the position in the years ahead. Tourism Ireland is targeting further growth in various sectors of the British market, which should help to further the spread of tourism business throughout the country. Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this market has been impressive. Last year Ireland welcomed over 3.5 <Col N="696"/>million visitors from Great Britain to our shores and these visitors spent almost &euro;1.3 billion here.</P>
    <P>With regard to our performance in the North American market, Ireland achieved an impressive growth rate of 6.5%, last year. During a very turbulent period for tourism internationally, Ireland has managed to out-perform many of its competitors in the US, due in large part to the concerted and co-ordinated efforts of Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry there. Access developments have also been a key driver of this strong performance. While there remains scope for further growth, 2003 marked a turning point in this market which Tourism Ireland and the industry are set to build on in 2004.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European market, Ireland continues to perform very well. In recognising the potential for growth in visitor numbers, Europe has been targeted for continued growth. In that context, Tourism Ireland has reviewed and continues to review its operations in the key continental European countries in which it operates. Already we are seeing the benefits of this review, especially from Germany, where the recent sluggish outbound market has been turned around by a concentrated consumer focused campaign there by Tourism Ireland.</P>
    <P>Southern Europe, including France, Spain and Italy, also performed exceptionally well in 2003. What is also encouraging is that our prospects of further above average growth from Europe are good because of new access developments and Tourism Ireland will continue to encourage and support the further development of such routes.</P>
    <P>Long haul markets have also been targeted by an intensive level of marketing activity by Tourism Ireland. Like many other European destinations, these markets were seriously affected by the recent external shocks to international travel. This was particularly evident in the dramatic reduction in air access capacity to Europe from Australia, which is the most important long haul market for Ireland. Early indications in 2004 indicate a resurgence in demand for travel to Europe with Ireland again out-performing the competition.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, the marketing programmes in train for 2004 will build on the momentum generated in 2003. With a comprehensive and highly targeted suite of marketing activities, Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are confident that they can meet the very ambitious target of 4% growth in visitor numbers.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for conducting a review of quality standards in tourism rests with the tourism State agencies.</P><Col N="697"/>
    <P>Since taking up office, I have consistently emphasised that the quality and levels of service offered by the tourism industry is critical to the successful development of the sector. Excellence in the physical design and quality of tourism products and good investment planning must be matched with equally good operational planning and delivery of services. If operational standards do not match the physical quality of facilities, the market potential of these facilities, for both overseas and domestic tourists may not be fully realised.</P>
    <P>Last May I established the new National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland. This is a well-resourced body which has been assigned responsibility for the promotion of excellence in product and service delivery which are priority requirements for both the overseas and domestic tourist. It has a clear mandate to take whatever actions are appropriate to help the industry to hold and increase its market share in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now up and running and is well positioned to support the industry in addressing the new set of challenges facing tourism into the future, including issues such as value for money, competitiveness and quality standards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 271 together.</P>
    <P><?oasys _ah?>I am aware of the comments made by the president of the Irish Hotels Federation. I have already made my views on competitiveness very clear. I agree with the tourism policy review group that restoring competitiveness is the major challenge facing the tourism sector and that the industry must offer better value to its customers if it is to maximise the opportunities for future growth. However, there is no immediate, single or easy solution to addressing concerns. The review group listed some ten specific actions in this area that require responses from the private and public sectors including recommendations on taking responsibility for restoring competitiveness, inflation, benchmarking, customer relationship management, management capability, high standards for competitive advantage and training.</P><Col N="698"/>
    <P><?oasys _xh?>My aim is to see a coherent action plan implemented effectively in co-operation with all the major players. To this end, I have established a high level implementation group to advise and assist in driving forward and monitoring the action plan set out in the report of the review group. The group had its first meeting in February and I expect its first six-monthly report in August.</P>

However, an expenditure review which is due to be completed by mid-2004 is being carried out on the programme and this review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. The question of reopening the programme can be considered following the completion of that review.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 268 together.</P><Col N="701"/>
    <?oasys _fc?><P>The Government has agreed to proceed with the development of a sporting campus at Abbotstown. Following the decision by the Government on 27 January last, I met the board of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, on 2 February. I outlined the Government&rsquo;s views for the sports campus to them and asked them to provide me with a phased and prioritised proposal, with a sporting and business case and annual budgets in respect of each element of the campus. I indicated that the delivery of the component elements of the campus should be put forward within a realistic timeframe by building on and updating the existing framework plan for the site, in consultation with the various interested parties and taking account of developments which have taken place in the meantime.</P>
    <P>While the precise elements of the campus will emanate from revisiting the existing framework plan and from the consultative process which has already commenced, it is likely that the campus will include pitches and training facilities, administrative facilities for the smaller sporting bodies which depend very largely on voluntary commitment. It might also include medical and training support for elite athlete development and, eventually, an indoor sporting arena, which it is expected would attract private sector investment.</P>
    <P>CSID has been given the responsibility for translating this concept into an action plan for delivery and overseeing a programme of development that, over time, will be seen as accomplishing a major transformation in the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s sporting infrastructure. As I indicated, the process of consultation with the various interested parties, in particular the national governing bodies of sport, has commenced and I expect to receive the outline proposals for the campus from CSID by the autumn.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned about the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums, especially in regard to young drivers.</P>
    <P>The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. The key measures include implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe. To date 32 of the recommendations have been fully implemented, four partially implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations. Another key measure is the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 <Col N="703"/>completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December 2003 and was signed into law on 28 December 2003. The provisions of this Act will be commenced in the near future. A CEO designate has been appointed and commenced duty on 2 February 2004. The proposed structure and staffing levels of the new body are finalised and a recruitment campaign is currently under way. The board will be operational when the necessary staff and IT systems are in place, which is expected to be in the second quarter of this year. The PIAB interim board has made significant progress in this regard. Another key measure is the undertaking by my Department and the Competition Authority of a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. The bulk of the study was completed in 2003 and a preliminary report and consultation document on competition issues in the non-life insurance market was published on 18 February 2004. Following a two-month consultation period, a final report will be published which will contain recommendations based on its findings.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made by the Department of Transport in regard to the implementation of the road safety strategy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Civil Liability and Courts Bill on 11 February. This Bill contains measures to streamline the law in regard to personal injury claims including measures to deal with fraudulent and exaggerated claims. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad on 11 February. It has completed Second Stage in the Seanad and is currently awaiting Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The MIAB recommendations that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, is charged with progressing/dealing with issues relating to public information, promotion of competition, transparency and consumer protection. One such recommendation relates to gathering of statistics on motor insurance and claims costs by IFSRA. On 10 December 2003, IFSRA published its first set of comparative tables of motor insurance quotations on its website, <i>www.ifsra.ie</i>. The motor insurance cost survey is based on eight driver profiles and is designed to show the range of quotes available for specific drivers in Ireland. Regular surveys will be published on the IFSRA website at three monthly intervals. This may be of particular interest to young drivers and demonstrates the advantages of shopping around.</P>
    <P>While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. Indications to date are that the reform <Col N="704"/>programme is having its desired effect. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was a reduction of 11.8 index points, <?oasys _jy?>11.1%, in motor car insurance between the months of January 2003 and January 2004. Further, the CSO noted a significant contribution from insurance to the recent reduction in inflation. As implementation of the reform programme continues, I expect further reductions to occur in all forms of insurance. I am also confident that the measures the Government is putting in place to reform the Irish insurance market will attract new players into the market leading to further downward pressure on premia.</P>

	<P>Decisions to prosecute offences on indictment under competition law are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority has advised me that it is its policy not to comment on active investigations or cases in the interest of preserving the integrity of its investigations or any subsequent legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that while criminal proceedings on indictment were not proceeded with in the case in question, civil proceedings by the authority are still pending and, therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

	<P>The conduct of investigations and any subsequent legal proceedings under competition law is an operational matter for the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that where the Competition Authority reaches agreements or settlements with parties it generally publishes details of those agreements either by way of an enforcement decision, a press release or in its annual report. With regard to the former, the authority launched its enforcement decision series in 2003 to inform the public about competition issues by publishing details of decisions concerning selected investigations where it had closed a file either because it had found no breach of competition law or had settled the case. In this regard the authority selects investigations that create a precedent, are of public interest or raise issues of complexity.</P>
    <P>I understand that in cases where the authority initiates civil proceedings but subsequently settles them, it is the authority&rsquo;s practice to have the terms of those settlements recorded in court. In that regard I refer to the Competition Authority&rsquo;s recently published annual report for 2003 in which it gives details of various civil cases that were settled in 2003.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a range of regulatory provisions either already in existence or pending in regard to the placing on the market, importation and use of fertiliser blends containing ammonium nitrate and these are administered and enforced by the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Health and Safety Authority. I am informed that these Departments and their agencies are in ongoing liaison with each other, and with representatives of the Irish Fertiliser Manufacturers Association, IFMA, with regard to the safety implications involved. I am also informed that all the parties have agreed an action plan outlining their respective roles.</P>
    <P>In short, the roles of the Departments and their agencies can be described as follows: the Department of Agriculture and Food carries out sampling and chemical analysis on fertilisers placed on the Irish market and alerts the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in case of non-compliance. It also carries out labelling checks for product identification purposes and to ensure that such products are in accordance with standards laid down in the various legal instruments; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform administers and enforces the Explosives (Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chlorate) Order 1972 (SI 191 of 1972), which is made under the Explosives Act 1875. This order declares that the substances specified in the schedule to the order shall be deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Explosives Act 1875. The schedule to the order includes, <i>inter alia</i>, ammonium nitrate and certain fertilisers, which contain ammonium nitrate in excess of 79% by weight. Under the terms of the order these substances are deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Act and are therefore subject to the security controls operated under that Act; the Health and Safety Authority, during its inspection of relevant sites, check that facilities and arrangements, including the provision of appropriate information and <Col N="709"/>training, for the safe storage of fertilisers are in place.</P>
    <P>There is also a commitment by the fertiliser manufacturing industry to review and update the safety information available to users of their products. Regulation (EC) No. 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers applies to products which are placed on the market as fertilisers designated &ldquo;EC-Fertilisers&rdquo; and in the context of the regulation importation of a fertiliser into the customs territory of the European Community is deemed to constitute placing on the market. Under this regulation, which has yet to be given full effect, high nitrogen content ammonium nitrate fertilisers, for example, those containing more than 28% by mass of nitrogen in relation to ammonium nitrate, are subject to a detonation resistance test. This will be required to be carried out by the supplying company and a test certificate must be made available five days prior to the importation of the fertiliser. For fertilisers with nitrogen content of less than 28% no detonation test is required. The regulation, <i>inter alia</i>, also specifies labelling requirements for fertilisers so that users are fully informed as to nutrients present for plant growth and percentage and forms of such nutrients, etc.</P>
    <P>Depending on the amount of fertiliser involved, if a company comes within the relevant thresholds for dangerous substances, the provisions of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 would also apply. The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 2004 are also relevant to the safe transport of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the relevant State agencies are liaising and co-operating with each other, and the manufacturing sector, in this important safety matter.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 3 of 25 March last which related to the impact to date on defence spending of EU defence measures and the anticipated impact on defence spending over the next ten years by EU defence-related measures and commitments.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply, the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, set out a medium-term strategy for defence <Col N="712"/>covering the period up to 2010. A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world-class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, both at home and abroad. This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.</P>
    <P>In seeking to modernise the Defence Forces in accordance with the objectives of the White Paper, I have been fully conscious of the need to obtain the best possible efficiencies from existing resources, and have reported to the House on many occasions on the methods by which this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council tasked the appropriate bodies of the Council to undertake the necessary actions towards creating, in the course of 2004, an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments. On 17 November 2003 the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, decided that this work would be supported by an agency establishment team which has since been set up by the SG/HR Javier Solana, and is working under his authority.</P>
    <P>As part of the mandate for the incoming Presidency, the European Council held in Brussels in December 2003 invited the Irish Presidency to take forward work on the further development of European military capabilities including, &ldquo;To advance the establishment, in the course of 2004, of an Agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Discussions on the establishment of the agency are continuing at EU level and will be included on the agenda of the informal meeting of Defence Ministers in Brussels on 5 and 6 April 2004. While much of the detail in regard to structure and functions of the agency has yet to be agreed, participation by respective member states in the Agency &mdash; as in all aspects of ESDP &mdash; will be voluntary.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the past, developments in this area may yield some future economies of scale or efficiencies in the procurement of defence equipment which I would obviously support. In that context the development of the agency may possibly be a development which will foster some cost/benefit improvements for future defence spending.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal which was established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. It also examines applications from producers whose herds have been restricted by animal disease in the current quota year. The person in question submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of animal disease and, having considered the application and the circumstances which applied in this case, the tribunal recommended an allocation of 30,000 litres. The person and his co-operative have been informed of this decision.</P>
    <P>In considering applications on the grounds of animal disease the tribunal takes account of the producer&rsquo;s total available quota, the quantity and pattern of milk deliveries, and the estimated requirement until the end of the quota year. Furthermore, it also makes allowance for other factors such as the length of time the herd was restricted, the increase in herd size due to the restriction, and the availability of temporary leasing in the producer&rsquo;s co-operative. While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available and the sizeable number of applications received, to meet fully all of the demands for additional quota.</P>

	<P>The discussions with the European Commission on the detailed implementing rules for the single payment scheme have now concluded. In the course of negotiations on these rules I have secured certain changes to the initial proposals for farmers who retired under the previous and current schemes of early retirement <Col N="715"/>from farming. The legal position laid down in the Council regulation is that payment entitlements can be established only for farmers who were active during the reference period &mdash; by definition, this excludes farmers who had retired under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming. In order to activate those entitlements in 2005, a farmer for whom they are established must continue to farm in that year and submit an area aid application.</P><?oasys_cl11.5-?>
    <P>Notwithstanding these constraints I have secured several favourable arrangements in regard to participants in the early retirement schemes such that where the transferee inherits the holding of the retired farmer, he or she can also inherit any entitlements established for the retired farmer. Farmers, including offspring of farmers who retired before the reference period, who take over the holding of a retired farmer at some date in the future will be able to apply to the national reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme. Where the transferee, whether family or non-family, took over the holding during the reference period and started farming for the first time, his or her entitlements will be based on the two year average or simply based on one year as the case may be. Farmers who entered the early retirement scheme after the reference period will have entitlements established for them provided they were actively farming and in receipt of direct payments during one or more of the reference years. Such farmers can apply in 2005 to establish those entitlements only, provided that a lease agreement is in place at that time whereby the entitlements can then be leased to the lessee.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has introduced a multidimensional policy, for the control and eradication of scrapie, based in large measure on EU law. This includes: active surveillance for the disease involving 10,000 rapid tests each at slaughterhouses and knackeries in 2004; a survey of genotypes among the main native breeds which was completed last year; measures for dealing with scrapie positive flocks which are in place since 2001 and which, since 1 October 2004, involve genotyping and partial depopulation of infected flocks. In addition, a national genotyping programme designed to increase levels of scrapie resistance in the national flock by facilitating the <Col N="716"/>genotyping of individual animals and promoting a genetic re-configuration of the national flock will be launched in the next few weeks and in parallel with this, a framework for the recognition of scrapie resistance in flocks, in the form of a flock status scheme, is being finalised.</P>
    <P>A framework for dealing with scrapie positive flocks has recently been finalised. This framework provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for free genotyping of the flock, retention of suitable genotypes for breeding, a measure of free genotyping for replacement rams, the payment of market value for breeding animals which have to be disposed of following genotyping &mdash; net of salvage value where these animals can be sent for human consumption &mdash; an additional payment for breeding ewes and the payment of factory value for factory lambs and hoggets. These arrangements are now being applied and all concerned are being notified accordingly. A total of 12 new positive flocks were confirmed with the disease in the first three months of 2004, while in 2003 there were 37 such flocks.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I attach considerable importance to animal welfare issues and have taken several recent initiatives in this area, including establishing the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, with a view to promoting and sustaining good practice and compliance with all of the relevant standards, whether on-farm, during transport or at time of slaughter. FAWAC is chaired by an independent chairman and includes representation from farming bodies, animal welfare organisations, livestock exporters, the veterinary profession, Teagasc and the agriculture Departments in Dublin and Belfast.</P>
    <P>FAWAC has already identified a number of areas that it feels are worthy of particular attention and made such issues part of its initial work programme. I am aware that some of the issues raised by the Deputy have been raised at FAWAC and are likely to be the subject of views or recommendations conveyed to me by that body. I will carefully consider any views that FAWAC may wish to offer on animal health and welfare issues and how concerns might be best addressed, while recognising that my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has particular statutory responsibilities for deer hunting and puppy <Col N="717"/>farming, under the provisions of the Wildlife Act 1976 and the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992. I have also established a scientific advisory committee on animal health and welfare, which is independently chaired and includes among its membership persons of particular expertise and scientific distinction. This Committee is available to advise me of the scientific dimensions of animal health or welfare. It is also available to assist FAWAC where required.</P><?oasys_cl11-?>
    <P>I do have statutory responsibility for fur farming, which is regulated for animal welfare purposes by the provisions of the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and by the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000 which transpose the provisions of EU Directive 98/58/EC. My Department inspects licensed fur farms under this legislation and under the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations 1995. In addition the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals apply.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965, which are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in Ireland are enforced by the Garda, who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal in this country. The penalties for cruelty under the 1911 Act were increased significantly by the Control of Horses Act 1996.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have for several years past provided end-year grants from available resources to animal welfare organisations throughout the country to help them in the work of providing direct care and welfare services to animals. In December 2003 I announced grants totalling &euro;850,000 to 80 organisations to help their efforts during 2004. This package encompassed organisations in every county in the country and brought to almost &euro;3.8 million the total amount of assistance made available to date to such organisations by my Department.</P>

	<P>Under the scheme for the purchase of notional service, civil servants may, subject to certain conditions, purchase notional service in respect of the shortfall of service which they would otherwise have in making up their maximum pension entitlements at retirement age. Service can be purchased in two ways: by periodic deduction from salary or by lump sum payment. <Col N="718"/>The purchase scheme has been designed in such a way as to ensure that it is self-financing and appropriate actuarial tables have been devised to cater for the different purchase options available. A person can be credited only with additional notional service for which he or she has paid.</P>
    <P>The officer concerned is retiring shortly. He exercised an option in 1990 to purchase three years service for superannuation purposes by periodic deductions from his salary until his 65th birthday. In 1995, he opted to purchase an additional one year and 325 days service. However, it has recently come to the attention of my Department that the deductions towards the first option of purchase of service were inadvertently discontinued when the deductions for the second option commenced in 1995. The officer&rsquo;s service at retirement will be 38 years and 26 days. My Department is discussing possible options with the person concerned for making good the shortfall in his service within the constraints of the purchase scheme.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the tax treatment differs as between family units comprising married, separated, cohabiting or same sex couples. The difference in treatment reflects the differing nature of the relationships involved, the legal arrangements which may exist between the relevant parties as regards, for example, maintenance and support, and the provisions of the general law as it relates to the status of familial structures.</P>
    <P>The working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which reported in August 1999, acknowledged that a key issue in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law. In my view, such a course, where changes in the tax code would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy, for example, in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships, would be problematic and unwise. I indicated to the D&aacute;il in February last that I had no plans to change the different treatments under the tax code and that is still my position.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As of 2 April 2004 the price of oil had risen by 36% since its 21-month low of $22.94 on 28 April 2003. The increased price of oil is due to several factors, including reduced supply and increased demand as a consequence of the recovering international economy. In the event of a sustained, significant increase in the price of oil, disposable spending power would tend to decrease and economic growth would tend to weaken both in Ireland and in our major trading partners. Our exports to the latter would decrease and inflation in Ireland would increase. Therefore, a sustained increase in the price of oil would impact negatively on both economic growth and inflation in Ireland. However, due to the recent appreciation of the euro the full effect of the increased oil price has not significantly impacted on Irish inflation. The strong euro has also mitigated the adverse impact on the European economy.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s economic forecast at budget time last December assumed that the 2004 price of oil would be $25.60 per barrel. The average price of a barrel of oil in the first quarter of this year has been 25% higher than that. However, model estimates conducted by the ESRI in the past indicate that if this price level were sustained for the rest of the year then it would reduce GNP growth by about one eighth of a per cent in the medium term.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners advise that a claim for the incapacitated child tax credit was made to the Sligo Revenue district by letter dated 25 April 2003. Two medical reports were enclosed with the claim. Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides an incapacitated child tax credit of &euro;500 for a person who proves that he/she has living at any time during a year of assessment a child who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. A child under 18 is regarded as permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity only if the infirmity is such that there would be a reasonable expectation that if the child were over the age of 18 years the child would be incapacitated from maintaining himself or herself.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that the medical reports indicate that the child concerned suffers from epilepsy (which is controlled by medication) and that he has learning and other difficulties.

    <P>In the circumstances the Inspector considered that the conditions for the relief were not satisfied. The Revenue Commissioners advise <Col N="721"/>that nothing has since emerged that would lead to a change in that decision.</P>

     <Quest>the position regarding the talks dealing with a new EU constitutional treaty; if this will lead eventually to a united states of Europe; and the effect this will have on the Irish Constitution.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position regarding the negotiations on the new constitutional treaty was set out in detail in Deputy Kitt&rsquo;s reply to Priority Question No. 5 of 31 March 2004. The European Council at its meeting on 25 and 26 March decided that agreement on the treaty should be reached no later than the June European Council.</P>
    <P>The constitutional treaty does not aim to create and will not result in the creation of a united states of Europe. A proposal to rename the European Union in this way received no support at the Convention. The constitutional treaty will make clear that all of the Union&rsquo;s competences are bestowed upon it by the member states, and it does not provide for a significant transfer of new competences to the Union. The draft states that:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Union shall respect the national identities of the Member States, inherent in <Col N="722"/>their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential state functions, including those for ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, and for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In addition, the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality are being strengthened, with a greater role for national parliaments.</P>
    <P>In the event that negotiations on the constitutional treaty are successfully concluded, it is likely that an amendment to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann will be required to allow for its ratification by Ireland, as has been the case with previous EU treaties. However, the scope and authority of the Irish Constitution will not otherwise be affected by the entry into force of the constitutional treaty.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that the use of Shannon Airport by the US military is a long-standing practice which has been in place for a number of decades.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the carriage of US troops by civilian aircraft carriers takes place in accordance with the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989, for which the Minister for Transport has responsibility. This legislation <Col N="723"/>is concerned specifically with the carriage of munitions of war and weapons and allows the Minister for Transport to issue exemptions for the carriage of such goods. There is no requirement for the identification of any specific military unit being transported.</P>
    <P>Permission for foreign military aircraft to land is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, must take place in accordance with the provisions of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, and is normally granted on conditions including that the aircraft be unarmed and not carrying arms, ammunition and explosives. Records show that the landing of the C-130 at Baldonnel military aerodrome in late March took place in conformity with these criteria.</P>
    <P>The flying of the &ldquo;jolly Roger&rdquo;, which is an informal flag with no particular status, was queried with the US Embassy. The embassy confirmed that the hoisting of unauthorised flags on US military aircraft is not permitted. Any further action would be a matter for the US authorities.</P>

My Department has received applications for additional special educational resources from the school in question. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to on or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision. The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The largely homogenous nature of the Mountmellick and Mountrath areas together with their relative close proximity to one another combine to make it a suitable starting point for an area development plan. Additionally, the imminent closure of Ballyfin College requires an exploration of all available options to cater for the residue of pupils following the closure. That is why it was thought that the Mountmellick-Mounthrath area should be considered in its totality under one plan. The purpose of area development plans, which is a radical new approach to school planning, is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. Thus parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to make their voices heard in the process. Following the consultation process, individual plans will set out the blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area covering a period of up to ten years. The plan will form the basis against which all capital funding decisions for the area will be made over that period of time.</P>

	<P>I should explain that for the purpose of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. While it is the prerogative of parents to send their <Col N="726"/>children to the school of their choice, it is not the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside, are eligible for transport under the scheme to that centre. Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</P>
    <P>It is the practice of my Department to consult with local educational interests, where any adjustment is being proposed to the existing catchment boundary arrangements. I will keep the Deputy informed of any developments in this regard.</P>

	<P>At primary level teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged from four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy my Department that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification in order to become fully recognised. These teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during this period. In order to satisfy the Irish language requirements for recognition as a primary teacher, applicants, who have been granted provisional recognition, must pass the written, aural and oral parts of the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge. Candidates who have Irish to primary degree level may be granted an exemption from paper II of the SCG and provide certification that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three-week course or its aggregated equivalent either in one-week blocks or in a combination of one-week and two-week blocks. On successful completion of the SCG, my Department pays a grant of &euro;431.71 to the individual concerned towards the cost of attendance at the Gaeltacht course.</P>
    <P>The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is the standard of Irish that would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must therefore demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language. It must be borne in mind that many primary schools not only teach Irish but also have Irish as the principal language of instruction and communication generally. The number of such schools has grown significantly in recent years. A primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that, in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.</P>
    <P>I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the SCG in 2001 which recently submitted its report to me. A copy of the report has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. Issues dealt with in <Col N="728"/>the report include the content and format of the examination modules, the standard of the examinations, courses of study for applicants for the examinations and the period of provisional recognition granted to applicants within which they are expected to pass the SCG. The report is under consideration and decisions on its recommendations contained in it will be taken very shortly. The working group earlier drafted an interim syllabus which was circulated to all schools in December, 2002. The SCG examinations held in October, 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be based on this syllabus copies of which, including a reading list of prose and poetry to be studied for the examinations, are available on request from Primary Administration Section 1, Department of Education and Science, Cornamaddy, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>An updated language syllabus for the SCG has also been published on the Department&rsquo;s website together with a handbook for the examination which was drafted by the working group. The handbook contains detailed information on the SCG and provides answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. It is planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>

	<P>Technology is provided for junior cycle students in 165 schools. While there is no follow-on subject in the senior cycle, there are three recognised technological subjects at leaving certificate level namely, engineering, construction studies and technical drawing which can be pursued by students who have studied technology at junior cycle level. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment began the process of reviewing the three technological subjects at leaving certificate level and of producing of a new syllabus for a follow-on subject for junior cycle technology in the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>Four syllabi are now with my Department for consideration. These are: engineering technology &mdash; formerly engineering; architectural technology &mdash; formerly construction studies; design and communication graphics &mdash; formerly technical drawing; and technology for which there is no equivalent leaving certificate subject. The opportunity to develop the four syllabi simultaneously has enabled each subject in this suite of interrelated subjects to take cognisance of the other three, resulting in a high degree of streamlining between the subjects. However, all four syllabi, in their revised/new state, represent a fundamental shift from the syllabi operating in <Col N="729"/>schools in terms of content, pedagogy, assessment arrangements and resource implications. Consequently, the implementation plan for the four syllabi will need to take account of a wide range of school-based and system-wide factors and will necessarily be complex. The NCCA is working on an implementation plan that will inform the decisions my Department will make in this regard.</P>

The school has the services of a full-time resource teacher and a shared learning support teacher. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. A dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service has reviewed the balance of more than 4,000 applications. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so.</P>
    <P>Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision. The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24-03, issued in September 2003, which contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

The theme was chosen to promote an interest in EU affairs among young people during the Irish EU Presidency. These visits presented the young people with an opportunity to express their views on what being part of Europe means to them and gave the Minister of State the opportunity to present and disseminate information on the importance of the period of change that lies ahead and to facilitate them in making a real contribution to the debate at national and European levels. A comprehensive and wide range of views and suggestions was raised during these visits on issues relating, for example, to the EU, young people and politics, youth participation, concerns of young people, etc. Deputy de Valera will take these views into account in future policy expansion and formulation for young people at national and EU levels.</P>

A large-scale building project for the school to which the Deputy referred is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. This project has been assigned a band 3 rating and is at early stages of architectural planning. When publishing the 2004 school building programme, I outlined that my strategy will be grounded in capital investment based on multiannual allocations. My officials are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multiannual school building programme from 2005 and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>While the school&rsquo;s application under the summer works scheme for 2004 was unsuccessful it is open to the school&rsquo;s management authority to apply for the 2005 summer works scheme when the scheme is announced later this year. All applications received for the 2004 summer works scheme were assessed and categorised by reference to the criteria detailed in appendix B of the circular letter governing the scheme: Prim 34-03. The available funding was then distributed on a top-down basis in accordance with the categorisation hierarchy. The purpose of this approach is to ensure precise targeting of funding. The school authority should use the devolved grant which my Department pays annually to deal with any urgent health and safety works.</P>

	<P><?oasys _dc15-?>In the current academic year the enrolments on PLC courses in certain schools and colleges have exceeded the number of places approved. Teacher allocations for 2004 and 2005 and capitation grants have been allocated on the basis of the approved number of places or the numbers enrolled. In the 2003 &mdash; 2004 academic <Col N="737"/>year nearly 28,700 places were approved. My Department is considering appeals from the VECs, schools and colleges for the recognition of the excess numbers enrolled for the purposes of teacher allocations and grants and a decision in the matter will be taken shortly in the light of the totality of demands for teaching resources across the system. At national level, meetings about the matter have been held recently between officials and representatives of the management and TUI interests in the sector. I have no plans to meet with the D&uacute;n Laoghaire branch of the TUI at this time.</P>

The final report was completed in April, 2003. The recommendations of the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision. The report poses considerable challenges for the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future. Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, further consultations with all the relevant interests about prioritisation of the recommendations will be necessary during 2004.</P>

<P>&emsp;The Aghina national school building project was listed in section 4 of the 2003 school building programme which was published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. It was planned that this project would be authorised to proceed to construction during 2003 subject to significant cost savings and a review of the enrolment levels later in the year. The school enrolment had declined significantly over the last number of years. Accordingly, the Department&rsquo;s schools inspector visited the school to ascertain the enrolment intake in September 2003. The enrolment at September 2003 had fallen to 25 pupils. Department officials met with the chairperson and representatives of the board of management of the school last December and again on 22 March last, to discuss issues relating to the proposed school building project. An all-in grant of &euro;250,000 was offered to the school management to address the accommodation issue. My Department is considering a response received from the school management regarding the building project and the proposed grant and will be responding to the board shortly.</P>

	<P>In 1998, a planning group representative of all the partners in education produced a report for my Department entitled A National Educational Psychological Service. The planning group examined staffing levels of educational psychology services in other jurisdictions and also investigated the likely <Col N="742"/>prevalence of problems for school children that would need psychological intervention.</P>
    <P>Arising from its investigations, the planning group estimated that 200 psychologists would be needed in the educational system as a whole in order to meet the needs of children in both primary and post-primary schools. In 1998, there were found to be 16 psychologists working in the city and county of Dublin vocational education committees and in the schools for young offenders, leaving a final total of 184 to be deployed within the national educational psychological service.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the findings of the planning group and recruitment for NEPS began in 1999. At present there are 126 psychologists in NEPS. Four more psychologists will take up employment after Easter 2004, and my Department is currently processing one more offer of employment to be taken up as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy, including an application for the pupil in question.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all of these cases were responded to before or soon after the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after the 31 August 2003, will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.</P>

	<P>Details of bodies and agencies reporting directly to and funded by my Department are set out in the attached appendix.</P>
    <P>The policy framework and the necessary funding are provided by my Department to enable the bodies and agencies under its aegis to carry out their functions in the context of achieving the effective delivery of overall government policy. My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2003-2005, which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department&rsquo;s website, articulates the Department&rsquo;s mission, high level goals and strategies aimed at the implementation of Government policy in regard to the three sectors for which my Department has responsibility. This is in turn used by bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department as a basis for their more detailed interpretation of their role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The statement of strategy also identifies specific outcomes, outputs, and performance indicators against which <?oasys _cl10.5-?>policy delivery is <Col N="747"/>measured, with progress reported in my Department&rsquo;s annual report. These reflect the roles played by the relevant bodies and agencies which are monitored through ongoing liaison with these bodies and agencies. My Department&rsquo;s first annual report, is expected to be published in April 2004, and will record satisfactory progress towards the achievement of the goals set out in the statement of strategy.</P>
    <P>In the performance of their functions, these agencies are required to have referred to Government policy and to comply with any general policy directives which may from time to time be given to them by the Minister.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting clubs and organisations and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The 2004 sports capital programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 30 November and 1 December 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 16 January 2004. A total of 1,304 applications were received before the closing date and these are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2004 programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2004 provide &euro;63.6 million for payment of capital grants in respect of the grants to be allocated in 2004 and for those allocated in previous years for which funding had not been drawn down in full to date but would be during 2004.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department funds the Irish Sports Council, ISC, the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. Funding for sports and recreation organisations is provided through the ISC. The financial provision for the ISC from my Department&rsquo;s Estimates was increased by 9% to <Col N="748"/>&euro;30.75 million for 2004, of which &euro;29 million<?oasys _cl11-?> is funded through the national lottery to the ISC for the implementation of the policies and programmes established to deliver on three major strategies: increased participation; developing performance and achieving excellence.</P>

	<P>Following the announcement in the 2004 budget of the decentralisation programme, a decentralisation committee was established within my Department which is currently planning the decentralisation programme in respect of the Department in liaison with the central implementation committee set up under the Department of Finance. The three agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and the Irish Sports Council, also due to decentralise, are represented on this committee.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s committee, which is headed by an assistant secretary, has met on several occasions and has issued a circular letter to staff of the Department in order to keep staff fully briefed on developments. An officer from my Department also attends the decentralisation liaison committee chaired by a principal officer from the Department of Finance. As Minister, I am driving the implementation of the programme in the Department and reporting on a regular basis to the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
    <P>My Department is in close contact with the Office of Public Works in regard to the issue of securing suitable accommodation for the Department and the Sports Council in Killarney, for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in Mallow and for the Arts Council in Kilkenny. I understand that a shortlist of sites and buildings has been drawn up. Further meetings are planned between officials of the OPW, my Department and of representatives of the three agencies.</P><Col N="749"/>
    <P>My Department has also sought up-to-date information from the local authorities in the three locations in order to prepare information packs on the locations for staff who express an interest in moving to these locations. Furthermore, the Secretary General of my Department met with the manager and town clerk for Killarney on a recent visit there. The decentralisation committee also plans a visit to the location.</P>
    <P>I understand that the central implementation committee, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn, which was charged with preparing and submitting an overall implementation plan by the end of March to the Cabinet sub-committee has met its deadline. The plan will influence and inform my Department&rsquo;s preparations for decentralisation and will give some information in regard to timelines, etc.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>the number of persons waiting for orthodontic treatment; the reasons for the long delay in providing such treatment; his plans to eliminate this waiting time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards-authority in the first instance. The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based, as happens under the existing guidelines, on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need.</P>
    <P>The guidelines were issued in 1985. They are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws, such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area, and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. The provision of <Col N="750"/>orthodontic services is currently severely restricted in some health boards due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to address the shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards-authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The chief executive officers of the boards-authority have informed my Department of the following information on their treatment waiting lists at the end of December 2003:</P><Col N="751"/>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I signed the Interim Health Service Executive <Col N="753"/>(Establishment) Order 2004 (S.I. No. 90 of 2004) on 9 March 2004 and it was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 10 March. The order established the Interim Health Service Executive &mdash; the interim executive &mdash; as a corporate body under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, as amended.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the interim executive is a critically important part of the implementation of the health sector reform programme. The reform programme, which is based on recommendations in the Brennan and Prospectus reports, will introduce fundamental changes in the health services. One of the primary features is the abolition of the existing health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to be replaced by a Health Service Executive.</P>
    <P>Under the establishment order, the interim executive has been given the task of drawing up a plan for the Minister&rsquo;s approval for: the establishment of a unified management structure for the proposed new health service executive; the integration of the existing health board structures into the new health service executive; the streamlining of other statutory bodies, identified in the Prospectus report, to be incorporated in the new structure; the establishment of regional boundaries for the delivery of primary, community and continuing care services; the establishment of procedures to develop a national service plan for the delivery of health services; the establishment of appropriate structures and procedures to ensure the proper governance and accountability arrangements for the proposed health service executive; and the appointment of a chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>The interim executive has also been given the task of making the necessary preparations to implement this plan, subject to ministerial approval, so as to ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the existing health board structure to the new health service executive structure. The interim executive will not have any implications for the current statutory role of the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing forward primary legislation at a later date which will provide the main legislative basis for the implementation of the health sector reform programme. It will establish the new health service executive to replace the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. It will also provide the legislative basis for other aspects of the reform programme, such as improved governance and accountability, planning and monitoring and evaluation. The establishment of the health information and quality authority, HIQA, on a legislative basis will also be provided for.</P>
    <P>As part of the phased implementation of the reform programme, I also intend to bring forward legislation dealing with the membership of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the area health boards and the health boards, the abolition <Col N="754"/>of the distinction between reserved and executive functions and the assignment of reserved functions of the authority, the area health boards and the health boards to the chief executive officers and the Minister for Health and Children, as appropriate, and amendments to the Health Acts 1947 to 2001 to implement these proposals. I expect to be in a position to publish this Bill shortly.</P>

	<P>Action 105 of the health strategy commits my Department to strengthening and expanding provisions for statutory registration of health professionals. In this context, the health and social care professionals Bill, establishing this system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals, is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, it is proposed that certain titles will be protected, that is, only those professionals registered with a registration board will be legally entitled to use the protected titles. It is also proposed that it will be an offence under the legislation for an unregistered person to use a protected title. While certain common titles will be protected in the health and social care professionals Bill, the Minister for Health and Children will be empowered to protect additional titles by regulation.</P>
    <P>In drafting the legislation, further advice and examination will be required of the many complex legal, competition and public interest issues that arise under the Bill, including in respect of protection of title. To this end, the <Col N="755"/>Deputy may wish to note that my Department commissioned the Institute of Public Administration in June of last year to undertake a study to elucidate various issues raised in the representations made to me concerning the case for and against protection of the title &ldquo;physical therapist.&rdquo; This report has now been completed and forwarded to stakeholders for their views.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Estimate for mental health expenditure in 2004 is &euro;661.35 million, or 6.69% of the total health budget, according to the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2004.</P>
    <P>In recent years, significant additional resources have been committed to developing comprehensive, community-based mental health services. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients from 5,192 in 1997 to 3,966 in 2002 with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services. There are now 411 community psychiatric residences in the country providing 3,146 places compared to 391 residences providing 2,878 places in 1997.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, approximately &euro;90 million additional revenue funding has been invested in the mental health services. In the main, this funding is being used to provide additional medical and health professional staff for expanding community mental health services, increase child and adolescent services, expand the old age psychiatric services, provide liaison <Col N="759"/>psychiatry services in general hospitals and enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>if, in view of the shortage of nursing staff and the limited intake for student nursing placement in the State, there is assistance available to students to complete nurse training courses in Britain.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10535/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In addressing the issue of nursing staff shortages, I refer the Deputy to the latest quarterly survey of nursing vacancies by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, which is for the year ending 31 December 2003. The survey shows that there were 994 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 31 December 2003. It also indicates that the vacancy rate now stands at 1.73% nationally, which is the lowest rate recorded since the surveys began. Moreover, the current vacancy rate of 1.73% could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and location.</P>
    <P>In 1997, there were 25,233 whole-time equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of September 2003 this figure had reached 33,442. This is an increase of over 8,200 during the period or 32.5%. These figures highlight the effectiveness of the measures which the Government has undertaken in recent years regarding the recruitment and retention of nurses. Among the most significant of these measures is the increase in the number of nursing training places by 70% since 1998. There are now a total of 1,640 undergraduate training places per annum. This increase in training places will ensure a high and steady number of nursing graduates entering the health service in the future.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in respect of financial assistance for students undertaking nurse training courses in the UK. Under his Department&rsquo;s higher education grant scheme, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states, including the UK. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>
    <P>Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the relevant State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. In addition, tax relief on tuition fees <Col N="760"/>is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also. All EU students, including those from Ireland, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students.</P>

The economic position in 2004 is reflected in the approach taken by the Government to spending Estimates in the health sector. The overall pattern in the health service is one of consolidation in 2004, this follows a number of years of rapid expansion and development of services. As the Deputy is aware, there has been significant additional investment in acute hospital services in the Western Health Board in recent years.</P>
    <P>The board has prepared a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services in the region which proposes the appointment of additional rheumatologists in the region. I agree that there is a need for additional investment in rheumatology services both in the west and in other regions. However, the question of funding for additional posts in the west may only be considered in the context of available resources and the Western Health Board&rsquo;s overall priorities for services in 2004 in the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, which is the statutory body with responsibility for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, carried out a review of rheumatology and rehabilitation services in 1995 and, in the context of this, is currently examining the Irish Society of Rheumatology, ISR, report, rheumatology manpower report 2002, which <Col N="761"/>examines the current state of rheumatology services and identifies the resources needed to develop this service. Future planning requirements will be considered by myself and my Department in the context of the Comhairle examination.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to higher diploma courses in oncology, accident and emergency, intensive care, coronary care and so on. Entry requirements for these courses vary from college to college. All colleges require applicants to have registration in the relevant division of the nursing register maintained by An Bord Altranais. Most courses require candidates to satisfy certain minimum experience requirements which may include a period working in the specialist area. Certain colleges require applicants to satisfy basic matriculation requirements if under age 23. Candidates aged 23 years or over may be accepted as mature students.</P>
    <P>The crucial requirement is that the applicant is a registered nurse or midwife, and no distinction is made in respect of the model of education undertaken to obtain registration. I take this opportunity to reassure the Deputy that the question of discrimination or prejudice does not arise.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, entry requirements to courses generally include requirements in relation to experience. In the circumstances, I do not consider that an accreditation system is required. In recent years, I have introduced a number of initiatives aimed at supporting the professional development of nurses and midwives. A nurse or midwife who wishes to undertake a part-time nursing degree course is entitled to have his or her fees paid in full. The position in respect of higher diplomas in specialist areas is that the nurse or midwife undertaking the course is entitled to receive full pay while doing so and to have his or her fees paid in full.</P>

A total of &euro;643 million has been invested in these services, of which &euro;388 million was provided for services to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism. The overall total includes an additional &euro;25 million in current expenditure which was made available by the Minister for Finance in the 2004 budget for services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;18 million is being used by services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to provide extra day services particularly for young adults leaving school in June 2004, emergency residential placements and to enhance the health related support services available for children with intellectual disability or autism. The allocation of capital funding in 2004 for the various programmes in the health services has not yet been finalised.</P>

The annual donor awareness campaign is a very important event in the calendar for the Irish health service. It highlights the need for organ donors generally and makes a very important contribution to the national health strategy&rsquo;s commitment to develop organ transplantation services with a view to increasing donation and utilisation rates.</P>
    <P>In previous years my Department has been pleased to support donor awareness week and I announced at the launch continuing support for the campaign with the provision of a grant of &euro;350,000.

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the pay awards recommended under the public service benchmarking body, PSBB.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing, which reported in 1998, made an observation that they considered that public health nurses, PHNs, operated at the level of clinical nurse specialist. In its submission to the PSBB, the Alliance of Nursing Unions &mdash; representing the Irish Nurses Organisation, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, IMPACT and SIPTU nursing &mdash; made a claim to have the PHN grade paid a differential of 10% over the rate of pay ultimately recommended for the clinical nurse manager 2, CNM2. At that time, PHNs were paid at the same rate as CNM2 plus a qualification allowance. Clinical nurse specialists are paid at the same rate as CNM2s. In respect of the statement contained in the report of the Commission on Nursing, the Nursing Alliance commented that, &ldquo;Clearly it was not considering the issue of pay rates for either grade but was merely making a statement of the unique role played by the PHN.&rdquo;</P><Col N="767"/>
    <P>The PSBB, which issued its report in 2002, recommended an increase of 9.2% for the PHN grade and an increase of 12.2% for the clinical nurse manager 2-clinical nurse specialist grade. The benchmarking process established new absolute levels of pay for nursing and other public service grades and, furthermore, stated that &ldquo;no benchmarked grade may receive a further increase as a consequence of the body&rsquo;s recommendations as they effect any other grade, whether benchmarked or not&rdquo;. In recognition of their qualifications, all PHNs are paid a qualification allowance &mdash; &euro;2,422 per annum &mdash; and PHNs who were in employment on 16 November 1999 are paid a further red circled allowance &mdash; &euro;1,390 per annum &mdash; on top of basic salary.</P>

     <Quest>further to Question No. 363 of 30 March 2004, the way in which he will ensure equality of access for persons requiring palliative care services, including radiotherapy, living long <Col N="768"/>distances from Dublin, Cork and Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10698/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to provide a <Col N="769"/>model of cancer care which ensures that patients with cancer receive the most appropriate and best quality of care regardless of their place of residence. To achieve this objective, an integrated and co-ordinated approach, which encompasses prevention, screening, cancer treatment &mdash; including medical, surgical and radiation oncology &mdash; supportive and palliative care, education, training and research, is required.</P>
    <P>The publication of the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care was approved by Government and launched on 4 October 2001. The report describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its development over a five to seven year period. My Department has provided funding to all the health boards on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to commence the development of palliative care services in line with the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The report recommended that palliative care needs assessment studies should be carried out in each health board area and these studies are either completed or nearing completion. Information gleaned from these studies will inform the future development of palliative care services at health board level in consultation with the consultative and development committees which have been set up as recommended in the report. In addition, a paediatric palliative care needs assessment study is nearing completion and the report of the expert group on specialist design guidelines for palliative care settings is also nearing completion. My Department, the health boards and the voluntary sector are actively involved in planning for the development of palliative care services in line with the recommendations in the report of the national advisory committee and funding is being provided for the development of such services on an incremental basis in line with the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>Regarding access to palliative care services, such services are provided in a number of facilities, both statutory and voluntary, and access to such services for patients in need of palliative care, including those with cancer, is based on need. My plan for the development of radiotherapy services is that the supra-regional centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway will provide comprehensive radiation oncology services to patients regardless of their place of residence. Specifically, these supra-regional centres will provide significant sessional commitments to patients in the mid-west, north-west and south-east. Approval has already issued for the appointment of two consultant radiation oncologists at Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway, with sessional commitments to the South Eastern Health Board and the North Western Health Board, respectively. I expect proposals in this regard to be finalised shortly for submission to Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, involving the Mid-<Col N="770"/>Western, Western and Southern Health Boards, to expedite the recruitment of two further consultant radiation oncologists at CUH and at UCHG.</P>
    <P>The immediate developments in the southern and western regions will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. We will also provide for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. We have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term. These appointments are specifically designed to offer patients in areas such as the mid-west and south-east equity of access to radiation oncology services that are in line with best international practice.</P>

	<P>The efforts of local communities in raising funds for local health services is a feature of our health system. The allocation of these funds is essentially a matter for these communities. In respect of radiation oncology services specifically, I have met the Mid-Western Hospitals Development Trust and the Mid-Western Health Board regarding their proposal for the development of a radiation oncology unit on the campus of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick. The proposal is for a facility to be constructed on a site to be made available by the Mid-Western Health Board and to be operated by a private hospital, with funds provided by the Mid-Western Hospitals Development Trust. I have been assured that the development will not require revenue or capital resources from my Department. My understanding is that it is intended to treat public and private patients at this facility.</P>
    <P>I have advised the representatives of the Mid-Western Health Board of the establishment of a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group which will advise, <i>inter alia</i>, on the national co-ordination and delivery of existing and planned radiation oncology services, including agreeing quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to provide a model of cancer care which ensures that patients with cancer receive the most appropriate and best quality of care regardless of their place of residence. My plan for the development of radiotherapy services is that the supra-regional centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway will provide comprehensive radiation oncology services to patients regardless of their place of residence.

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
     <Quest>the reason breast screening, including BreastCheck, is not integrated into the regional centre at Waterford Regional Hospital.</Quest>
     <QRef>[10739/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The national breast screening board was established under the Health Act 1970 to implement a scheme for the early diagnosis and primary treatment of breast cancer in women in the 50 to 64 age group. Phase one of the scheme operates in the eastern part of the country. Last year, I announced the extension of the programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and the national roll-out to the western and southern parts of the country. Under the BreastCheck scheme, women will have their diagnosis, investigation and primary treatment managed by a multidisciplinary team.</P>
    <P>Two centres operate in the eastern region, one at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, and the other at the Mater Hospital, Dublin. In 2002 the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services, EUREF, evaluated the BreastCheck programme at these centres. EUREF concluded that the programme operated to a very high standard. The overwhelming majority of women whose breast cancer is detected by BreastCheck receive their primary treatment and follow-up at one of these centres. Women also have an option of treatment and follow-up at their regional designated centre for symptomatic breast disease. BreastCheck organises its services to ensure integrated clinical pathways are in place to effectively treat and care for women with breast cancer which involves close linkages with the symptomatic services.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck is developing a similar model of treatment and care as part of the national extension of the programme which will require a further two centres. The centre in the south, which will provide services for women in County Waterford, will be located at the South Infirmary <Col N="773"/>Hospital, Cork, and the centre in the west will be located at University College Hospital, Galway. Both these centres are at the planning stages. Women diagnosed with breast cancer under the BreastCheck programme in the Waterford region, for example, will be referred to the centre in Cork as soon as it is operational. They will also retain the option of seeking referral to the regional symptomatic services at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

	<P>The identification, prioritisation and provision of health centres to meet the health and personal social service needs of local communities are matters for the health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. Prior to proceeding with the development of such facilities, there are, however, a number of requirements that need to be satisfied. Of fundamental importance in informing a decision to allow a health board or the ERHA to proceed with a particular development is the availability of sufficient funding to meet the full cost involved. Additionally, all health boards and agencies are required to follow the Department&rsquo;s guidance documentation for capital projects, together with national and EU capital procurement procedures. It is a requirement, in the first instance, for the health agency involved to submit to the Department project details for agreement such as assessment of need, option appraisal, design brief, cost estimates and cash flow projections.</P>
    <P>The former Eastern Health Board and its successors, the ERHA and the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, in conjunction with Ballymun Regeneration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dublin City Council, established for the purpose of advancing the regeneration of the area, proceeded with the development of the project to hand involving a new health centre and community care headquarters as part of the new civic office development which was to be the centrepiece of the redevelopment of Ballymun town centre. The project was pursued with <Col N="774"/>neither the involvement nor approval of my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department recently met the ERHA and NAHB in respect of this project, following which the latter recently submitted further documentation regarding various aspects of the proposal. This material is being examined by my Department which will continue to work with the ERHA and the NAHB with a view to resolving outstanding issues and progressing this project at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>The Road (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 give local authorities the power to apply restrictions to heavy goods vehicles from entering particular public roads or areas. Article 17 of these regulations provides that, where the applicable traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road, the driver of a vehicle, the unladen weight of which exceeds the weight specified on the sign, is prohibited from proceeding beyond the sign except where it is necessary for the vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road. Such a prohibition pursuant to article 17 operates on a 24 hour basis. The application of such restrictions is a matter for each local authority.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have conveyed assurances and clarifications on several occasions to ICTU and the trade unions in Aer Rianta in respect of the protection of the current tenure and terms and conditions of employment of Aer Rianta workers on transfer to the three new independent airport authorities when established. Broad financial projections for each of the three airports are currently being finalised and, when this work is completed, I have already confirmed my willingness to share key financial information with the unions in the context of the current engagement process, which is being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, before legislation is finalised. In due course, I look forward to a resumption of this engagement process at which issues of concern to Aer Rianta workers can be discussed further.</P>
    <P>Any commercial company, whether in the public or private sector, can encounter difficult trading conditions from time to time. I believe that each of the individual State airports, under new visionary leadership, will respond effectively to the challenges of a rapidly changing aviation environment. I have already announced the <Col N="778"/>boards designate for Dublin and Shannon Airports which bring together people of the highest calibre and combine considerable international and national aviation expertise with proven financial and business acumen. I will announce the full membership of the new Cork Airport board designate shortly. When formally established, I am confident that these new autonomous boards will devise the necessary strategies and plans to promote and develop the airports and, together with management and staff, meet the requirements of airlines and passengers as well as assisting in the economic and tourist based development of their catchment areas.</P>

	<P>The person in question arrived in the State in October 2002 and made an application for asylum. His wife had arrived in the State the previous month, September, and made an asylum application. She had a child in October 2002. Both withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp;  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There is a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered, but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to make a deportation order. <Col N="782"/>In that context, a notification of a proposal to make a deportation order issued to the person in question on 9 March 2004 and he was given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order, he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned both made an application for asylum in the State, the husband in April 2001 and the wife in September 2001. They subsequently withdrew their asylum applications and made an application for residency on the basis of their parentage of an Irish born child.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp;  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The persons referred to by the Deputy withdrew <Col N="783"/>their asylum applications after this date and therefore an application for residency based solely on parentage of an Irish born child could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered, but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport them. In that context they have already been notified of such a proposal on 3 March 2004 and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.</P>
    <P>Given the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Question No. 510 of 23 March 2004 in which he enquired about dealing No. D2001SM05844A. This dealing was associated with D2001SM005843Y, inadvertently quoted by the Land Registry as D2003SM005843Y in that response. The Registrar of Titles has confirmed that both these applications were completed on 29 July 2002. The Registrar of Titles is unaware of any error in relation to these registrations.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a further application for a transfer of part was lodged on 10 October 2002 on the folio referred to by the Deputy. Dealing No. D2002SM009008W refers. I am further informed by the Registrar of Titles that the matter has been expedited and is receiving attention in the Land Registry.</P>

	<P>The EU accession states, including the Czech Republic, were designated as safe countries of origin on 15 September 2003 by order made under the Refugee Act 1996. By virtue of this designation, asylum applications from nationals of these states are prioritised for processing by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Accordingly, it is expected that there will be very few such applications on hands on 1 May 2004 when the Czech Republic becomes a full member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The position concerning the treatment of any outstanding asylum applications which may be on hands from nationals of the accession states generally on 1 May 2004 is under consideration at the present time and will have regard to the fact that from that date, the ten accession states will be party to the treaties governing the European Communities and their citizens will, in general, enjoy the same rights in relation to free movement as current EU citizens.</P>

	<P>Asylum seekers have a right of temporary residence in the State while their applications are being processed and are not considered for deportation unless their applications are refused or they are transferred to another EU state pursuant to the Dublin Convention to have their asylum applications processed there.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, allows the Minister to make deportation orders in respect of nine categories of person. These include asylum seekers who have failed in their applications or asylum seekers whose applications are being transferred under the Dublin Convention.

    <P>The central authority for child abduction operates in my Department for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children. Both these conventions contain provisions pertaining to access and apply to children under the age of 16.</P>
    <P>The central authority and the person referred to by the Deputy have been in correspondence with each other. I assure the Deputy, however, that no assurance of the kind mentioned in the question was given by the central authority, nor could such assurance be given since it is a matter for the relevant UK authorities alone.</P>
    <P>In response to correspondence from the person referred to by the Deputy, the central authority sought further information from that person to make it possible for the central authority to transmit an application to make arrangements for the exercise of rights of access under Article 21 of the Hague Convention. The central authority is ready to offer what assistance it can once that information is received.</P>

	<P>An application for capital grant assistance from the 2000 &mdash; 2006 equal opportunities child care programme was received from this community based group on 3 February 2004.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day administration of the programme is undertaken by Area Development Management Limited which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments of all applications for grant assistance under the programme, on my behalf. All large scale capital projects are referred by ADM Limited to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money.</P>
    <P>I understand that this application is under appraisal. On completion of the assessment <Col N="788"/>process, this application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities. My Department is carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground.

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to concerns expressed at the security implications of the importation of significant amounts of enriched ammonium nitrate blends of fertilisers from outside the EU, especially in view of reports that such material <Col N="790"/>has been used in terrorist bombings abroad; if, in view of the fact that the importation into Northern Ireland of such material has been banned by the authorities there on security grounds, he has plans to impose similar controls or restrictions in this jurisdiction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers have been used by terrorists to manufacture improvised explosive devices in this jurisdiction, and in Northern Ireland, for many years. For that reason, regulations were introduced in 1972 in both parts of the Island declaring ammonium nitrate and some ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers to be explosives.</P>
    <P>In particular, SI 191 of 1972, Explosives (Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chlorate) Order 1972, declares that the substances specified <Col N="791"/>in the Schedule to the order shall be deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Explosives Act 1875. The Schedule to the order includes,<i> inter alia,</i> ammonium nitrate and certain fertilisers which contain ammonium nitrate in excess of 79% by weight. Under the terms of the order, these substances are deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Act and are, therefore, subject to the same security controls for licensing, importation and storage as conventional explosives.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland order was amended in 1996 to state in essence that no one particle in a blended fertiliser may contain more than 79% by weight of ammonium nitrate. This means that if a blend contains a single granule or &ldquo;prill&rdquo; of ammonium nitrate it would fall within the remit of the order and would be declared an explosive.</P>
    <P>The question of amending the relevant order in this jurisdiction in line with the amended order in Northern Ireland was considered in 2000 but, following consultation with all relevant agencies, including the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the State Laboratory, it was decided that such an amendment was not necessary. However, in the light of recent events and the concerns expressed in relation to certain imports, I have asked officials of my Department to consult urgently with all relevant State agencies and the industry to examine these substances with a view to assessing the ease of segregation of ammonium nitrate from the blended fertiliser and to make recommendations in relation to the control of the substances.</P>

	<P>The provision of education to unaccompanied minors is a matter for the <Col N="792"/>Minister for Education and Science and my Department has no role in this regard. Their care is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area, the East Coast Area Health Board, ECAHB, carries out this function for the three local area health boards.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 which was commenced on 27th May, 2003, restricts the awarding of a rent supplement to asylum seekers. Guidance issued to health boards by the Department of Social and Family Affairs &mdash; SWA Circular No. 02/03 &mdash; stipulates that, where unaccompanied minor asylum seekers reach 18 years of age and are discharged from the care of a health board, they should be offered placement in adult direct provision accommodation.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, when unaccompanied minors reach 18 years of age and are discharged by the health boards from their care they are provided with direct provision accommodation by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, which operates under the aegis of my Department. It should be noted, however, that a health board, in line with the provisions of social welfare legislation, may exercise discretion and retain persons in its accommodation who have attained 18 years of age where there is a determination that the individual is vulnerable or does not have a sufficient level of maturity to be accommodated in an adult facility.</P>
    <P>To date the RIA has arranged placements for approximately 150 former unaccompanied minors in direct provision accommodation at the request of the ECAHB. In addition, the RIA has also arranged a small number of placements in such accommodation in the Cork city area at the request of the Southern Health Board. The RIA, in consultation with the dedicated social work team of the ECAHB working with unaccompanied minors, has made a major effort to ensure that former unaccompanied minors who are second level students are facilitated in continuing to attend school by effecting placements close to their previous health board accommodation.</P>
    <P>During the February mid-term break a senior official from the RIA attended meetings with former unaccompanied minors who had been relocated to direct provision accommodation to discuss what further initiatives could be put in place to facilitate their continuance in education. The RIA also engaged in discussions with VECs, Southside Partnership, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Refugee Support Group, Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, and the ECAHB to identify ways to improve transitional supports for former unaccompanied minors attending school. Arising from these discussions study facilities are being enhanced in direct provision centres. It is also intended to improve tutor supports for leaving certificate students. In the context of transitional supports the NAHB will ensure that all leaving <Col N="793"/>certificate students in direct provision receive appropriate SWA payments. In addition, every full-time student is being advised to avail of their entitlement to child benefit until they reach 19 years of age. Further referrals of former unaccompanied minors are due to take place over the coming months and I am informed by the RIA that they have agreed with the ECAHB to defer referrals of examination students until the State examinations have been completed in late June 2004.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the power to make by-laws of this nature is already available to local authorities. In fact some local authorities have already taken decisive action to control the consumption of alcohol in certain public places by adopting by-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor in public places within their administrative areas. I have been informed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the statutory basis for such action by local authorities is to be found in Part 7 of the Local Government Act 1994 and the Local Government (Bye Laws) Regulations 1995, that the making of by-laws in relation to this particular issue is a matter for each local authority and that no ministerial confirmation is necessary. Any proposals to amend that legislative framework would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>In so far as my area of responsibility is concerned, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has extensive powers under certain provisions of the 1994 Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act to deal with drink related problems wherever they occur and irrespective of the person&rsquo;s age. These powers have been strengthened very significantly in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 which came into force on 28 June 2003. That Act is designed to tackle the problem of drunken late night street disturbances and provides for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises as well the making of exclusion orders on individuals in addition to any penalty which may already be imposed under the 1994 Act. Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 tightened up the law quite considerably in relation to the sale and supply of drink. With regard to the matter of the supply of drink to under-aged persons, the Act prohibits the purchase or delivery of alcohol for <Col N="795"/>consumption by a person under 18, except where it is for consumption in a private residence and with the explicit consent of parents or guardians. In so far as specific measures to outlaw drinking in public open spaces, such as parks and green spaces are concerned, the provisions in the criminal law and intoxicating liquor laws which I have outlined above are general in their scope and effect, and as such would certainly be capable of being enforced by the Garda in these situations.</P>

    <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended in 1986 and 2001, sets out the requirements for naturalisation. These conditions are: an applicant must be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; [section 16A of the said Act provides that no period of residence shall be reckoned in respect of which an applicant does not have my permission to remain in the State or has been granted permission to remain for the purposes of study or has been seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996]; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have received one report of burglary and one of criminal damage to the school mentioned by the Deputy between 1 January and 14 February, 2004. I also understand from the Garda authorities that a number of complaints have been received about youths loitering in the vicinity of the school at weekends and in the evenings. Local garda&iacute; have responded to these complaints and moved youths on when appropriate. I am assured that the area receives ongoing attention from mobile patrols and community garda&iacute; on foot patrol and that local Garda management are satisfied that there are adequate resources deployed to deal with the problem mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

I have already indicated that, in the event of the closures going ahead, the intention is to transform these two open centres into post release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. Neither of the two centres would be under the control of the Irish Prison Service.</P>

	<P>Around 15 persons and organisations responded to the invitation to make submissions in relation to the scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill published last July. In addition, views were received from Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General, and the Director of Public Prosecutions when the scheme of the Bill was first published. During the drafting <Col N="797"/>process there were consultations with Garda management, meetings with a number of the Garda associations, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and there was continual consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. The individuals and bodies who made submissions were 1: Mr. Brian B. Waters, member of Amnesty International; 2: Mr. Philip Cronin; 3: Mr. Michael Kearney; 4: Mr. Brendan Cafferty; 5: Fingal Development Board; 6: Irish Council for Civil Liberties; 7: Dr. Barry Vaughan; 8: Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, Sinn F&eacute;in; 9: Mr. Jim Desmond; 10: Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Leary, Listowel Town Council; 11: Professor Dermot Walsh, University of Limerick; 12: Cork County Council; 13: Garda superintendents; 14: Mr. Dan Danaher, Irish south-west branch NUJ; and finally, 15: the Human Rights Commission.</P>
    <P>All the submissions were welcome, were given due consideration and contributed to the process. The Deputy will be aware that the final Bill as published in February builds upon and in some respects differs from the original scheme. I am currently considering amendments arising from points made by Senators during the Second Stage Debate on the Bill in the Seanad.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia was presented by the Commission in November 2001. It has been extensively debated but, in April 2003, the then Presidency conceded that it was unable to obtain final agreement on the proposal. In preparation for the Irish Presidency, I visited the capitals of member states for an exchange of views with Justice and Interior Ministers on many issues relevant to our Presidency, including whether there was any realistic chance that agreement could be reached on this framework decision. As it was clear to me that positions had not changed, and it was unlikely that they would change in the timeframe of the Irish Presidency, I reluctantly concluded that attempting to initiate further discussions at this stage would divert resources which would be better concentrated on issues where there was a possibility of agreement. The current text of the framework decision, that is the text on which agreement could not be reached in April 2003, is one with which I concurred and I hope it will not be too long before all member states are in a <Col N="798"/>position to agree a final text. At that time I will seek the approval of the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas to it.</P>

    <P>The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention has carried out a number of inspections since his first annual report was published last year. His reports of inspections at the places of detention at Fort Mitchel and Loughan House and at Wheatfield Prison were recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.justice.ie</i>. The inspector made a number of recommendations in these reports aimed at improving services and conditions in the relevant institutions. Some of the recommendations have been implemented and others will be implemented as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Fort Mitchel Place of Detention closed on 10 February 2004 due to the failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish Prison Service. Fort Mitchel will resume its role as a closed detention centre in the event that agreement is reached with the Prison Officers Association. Implementation of longer-term recommendations made by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention will be considered in the context of the reopening of Fort Mitchel.</P>

    <P>A preliminary report for Creggs sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department by Galway County Council in 1999 but has not been approved.</P>
    <P>The scheme was seventeenth on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to local authorities in 1998 to undertake a five yearly assessment of the needs for capital water services works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council at that time it has not been possible to include it in the water services investment programme. The scheme is fourth in the most recent priority list of sewerage schemes furnished by Galway County Council last December in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities in 2003 to produce updated assessments of needs. This latest assessment will be taken into account in the framing of the next phase of the water services investment programme in due course.</P>

	<P>EU Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise is required to be transposed into national law by 18 July. It applies to noise from, <i>inter alia</i>, industrial activity and major sources of road, rail and air traffic. It does not apply to noise from, <i>inter alia</i>, domestic activities, and noise created by neighbours and at workplaces.</P>
    <P>Legislation governing noise disturbance from construction activity is provided for under the Planning and Development Act 2000. It enables planning authorities to impose planning conditions on a permission to reduce or prevent noise emissions on a case basis. Enforcement of any such conditions is a matter for the relevant planning authority. Also, under the Act a planning authority may include objectives in its development plan to reduce or prevent noise emissions. Where this is done development control decisions must be made by reference to the development plan objectives.</P>
    <P>Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise from any premises, processes or works. The EPA has power to control an activity for which a licence is required under the integrated pollution control licensing system.</P><Col N="805"/>
    <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994 a local authority, the EPA or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. I am aware that noise in the workplace, including construction sites, is regulated under the health and safety code, with operational responsibility falling to the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

    <P>Over recent years the funding from the local government fund was increased significantly. Some &euro;752 million was allocated in general purpose grants in 2004. It represents an increase of 14% over the corresponding allocation for last year and is almost 121% higher than 1997.</P>

    <P>The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. This involves the disbursement of up to &euro;30 million. An invitation to organisations and groups to apply for funding was advertised in the national newspapers on Friday 21 November 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications for this round of funding was 5 p.m. on 5 March, as advertised in the national newspapers on 20 February.</P>
    <P>According to ADM&rsquo;s records no application was received from the organisation concerned by the deadline. An application was received on Monday, 29 March. Evidence has been provided of an unsuccessful attempt to fax application details on 5 March after the 5 p.m. deadline.</P>
    <P>The delivery of applications is a matter for applicant groups. However, the published deadline is the same for each medium, whether it is by post, by hand, fax or e-mail.

    <P>As mentioned in my reply to Questions Nos. 100 and 102 on 9 March, the report on ADM to which the Deputy refers noted the context in which ADM operates and how it has changed significantly since its inception, in particular, a shift from EU to Exchequer funding.

    <P>I also indicated that the Government accepted the broad thrust of the report. ADM should be restructured to better reflect the context and priorities that now obtain, including the appointment of the chair and members of the board. I do not wish to pre-empt the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the matter. However, people should have relevant experience or competencies and should not be selected to represent sectoral interests. Of course persons involved in the community and voluntary <Col N="809"/>sector would not be precluded from being appointed by Government.</P>

     <Quest>the number of defined benefit schemes that fall short of the minimum funding standard under the Pensions Act 1990; the proportion that it represents of all schemes that have been examined; and the implications and advice that she can offer to members of pension schemes that fall short of the minimum standard.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The minimum funding standard that applies to defined benefit occupational pension schemes under the Pensions Act 1990 is a wind-up standard. It is designed to ensure that there are sufficient assets to meet the liabilities. The standard has served pension members well since 1990. Over the past couple of years it has come under considerable strain and there are differing views on its appropriateness in current circumstances. One view is that a wind-up standard is not appropriate for pensions because the vast majority of them do not wind-up. They require long-term investment strategies. Others take the view that the only way to achieve security of members&rsquo; benefits is to have a wind-up standard.</P>
    <P>There is tension between the desire to ensure the security of members&rsquo; benefits in the event of a wind-up and the need to ensure that employers, who have voluntarily set up occupational pension schemes, are not penalised in the short-term <Col N="810"/>when they can in fact meet their long-term liabilities. The Pensions Board is reviewing the funding standard in the light of experiences here and abroad over the past number of years. It will report to me later this year. I facilitated some flexibility being introduced to ease employers&rsquo; burdens in the short-term pending the overall review.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board is the statutory regulator of occupational pensions and monitors compliance with the funding standard. The board gave me the following data. During the 12 month period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, 444 actuarial funding certificates were submitted to the board by the trustees of defined benefit occupational pension schemes. Of these 98 AFCs, or 22%, certified that the schemes in question did not satisfy the funding standard requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>Of these 98 schemes 68 have been examined and finalised by the board as follows: 54 funding proposals are designed to ensure the scheme can return to full funding within 3.5 years; and the remaining 14 funding proposals have, in accordance with the legislation I introduced in 2003 to allow greater flexibility, a later date specified for a return to full funding. The board is examining the submission of funding proposals in respect of the remaining schemes.</P>

	<P>Unemployment benefit provides for periods of involuntary unemployment. It is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment or self-employment. To qualify for payment a person must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work in respect of each declared day. Also, a person must be unemployed for at least three days in six consecutive days, excluding Sunday, to qualify for payment of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>My Department administers a number of schemes to assist and encourage people to take up part-time or full-time employment. Among these are the family income supplement. It is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families, preserving the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she claimed other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Subject to a minimum of 19 hours work per week or 38 hours per fortnight and the expectation that the employment will last at least three months, payment is calculated at 60% of the difference between the family&rsquo;s weekly <Col N="811"/>assessable income and the threshold amount specified for the family size.</P>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is designed to encourage people in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance to accept an offer of part-time work in the absence of full-time vacancies. Subject to a maximum of 24 hours employment per week and regardless of earnings, a standard married or single rate of PTJI is payable. A person may claim unemployment assistance, subject to satisfying a means assessment, in preference to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The back to work enterprise allowance scheme has a minimum qualification of three years unemployed. The back to work allowance scheme has a minimum qualification of five years unemployed. Both schemes are available to people who wish to take up self-employment or insurable employment for at least 20 hours per week.</P>

Rent supplement is determined by the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances. Account was taken of the second child. A one-parent family payment was subsequently increased to the level appropriate to a person with two children. The adjustment also affected the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
