      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The code of conduct for office holders, as drawn up by the Government following extensive consultations with the Standards in Public Office Commission, was published by the commission on 3 July 2003. The code applies prospectively from that date. Given that the code has applied for only eight months and that it resulted from such an extensive consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, I have no plans to amend it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>After the Taoiseach&rsquo;s return from the love-in over the weekend, does he think it appropriate that persons who are now officeholders find themselves unable to deliver on what they said would be their work during their period in Government? In view of two issues that were raised in the D&aacute;il over the past two months, the first of which concerned Punchestown&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The three questions refer to plans to amend the code of conduct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Ceann Comhairle is going to fly at me. He was deliberately waiting for that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1146"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The policing of the code of conduct is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am going to ask the Taoiseach whether he will amend the code of conduct. The Ceann Comhairle was waiting patiently. As soon as I mentioned Punchestown, here comes the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>He was waiting to punch Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny should try Cheltenham next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair was being very generous to Deputy Kenny in allowing his first question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Tuesday, 2.31 p.m., the Ceann Comhairle strikes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go all over the place with questions. The three questions were submitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not go all over the place. I was going to travel from Punchestown to Kenmare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The three questions are there and we are talking purely about plans to amend the code of conduct. As I pointed out to the Deputy, the policing of the code of conduct is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It might require an amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach whether it is proposed to amend the code of conduct for officeholders so that politically-appointed advisers will not sit on boards that decide multimillion euro contracts? Will the code of conduct for officeholders be amended to cater for situations in which the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political adviser is in a position to indicate the types of letter that other Ministers should write, in respect of which approval is again given for substantial allocations of money that have not been the subject of published criteria on the drawing of grants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The code of conduct does not stand in isolation. It is part of the wider ethical framework that the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 established. Section 10(7) of the 2001 Act binds officeholders to have regard to and be guided by the code. Everything that is in the Acts must be followed. Most issues that have arisen and any of the rules and procedures that must be followed are there. Some of the issues Deputy Kenny mentioned are not in breach of any codes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1147"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Members would be interested to know whether any complaints have been made so far under the code. Will the Taoiseach give any thought to the need for an amendment on the opening of bank accounts in family members&rsquo; names to obscure controversial moneys received by a Minister, for example? Does that require an amendment or is it covered under the code at present?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about amendments, so I thought it would be worth asking the Taoiseach whether that matter would be worthy of an amendment.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach think that the decentralisation announcement calls into question adherence to the code, given that five out of the eight Departments that are being decentralised are going to Ministers&rsquo; areas and that Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, made no secret of the political advantage in that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is again going outside the content of the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that not be a case for an amendment, or is it covered under the code?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether there have been any complaints. That is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission. Some of the matters Deputy Sargent mentioned would come within the ambit of the Act and some of the other matters would not come within it. Normal executive decisions would not come within the ambit of a code that is meant to achieve the highest standards. The Deputy is talking about normal decisions made by a Government Department with which there is nothing wrong. If anyone was receiving money that would come within the Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that office holders generally have a higher level of public profile and therefore should be mindful that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, you are going well outside the content of the three questions, which refer to amending the code of conduct for office holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If you allow me to finish the sentence I have started, it will become obvious to you and everyone else that my question is relevant. I will start once more. Does the Taoiseach agree that office holders, who have a particularly high profile, have a responsibility or duty to be mindful that any action on their part with regard to the use of resources could be construed as inappropriate in the context of an election?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1148"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, that question does not arise out of these three questions. For the benefit of the Deputy, your question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is outrageous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;like the others, ask the Taoiseach if it is proposed to amend the code of conduct for office holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If you allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, I will continue. The painful exercise of this constant challenge need never upset any of us. In the time this has taken I could have asked the question and the Taoiseach could be on his feet replying. Does the Taoiseach propose to extend the code of conduct, as it should apply, to all elections, including local and EU elections? Does he agree that there are many instances of actions by Ministers in the lead-up to elections that are construed by many as inappropriate? Will the Taoiseach consider some of the announcements made over the weekend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, that does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;by many of his colleagues in Cabinet in terms of sweeteners and promises, which his party is very good at, in the lead-up to the local and EU elections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is being disorderly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only trying to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ways and means of asking questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very difficult passage from here to there, and even when we get there we still do not get answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, it is not appropriate to go outside the substance of the three questions submitted to the Taoiseach. In fairness to Deputies who have asked other questions, they are entitled to have them answered today or tomorrow. If the Deputy goes all over the place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure you I intend to be absolutely fair to all others who have asked questions. My problem is with the Member who must answer them. Perhaps the Taoiseach will be good enough to advise the House whether he intends to extend the code of conduct to apply to <Col N="1149"/>local and European elections. It clearly seems to have no application in these areas, judging by the raft of promises and sweeteners offered over the weekend, with which the Taoiseach is no doubt delighted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The code of conduct applies to office holders, to me, the T&aacute;naiste, Ministers, Ministers of State and chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of this House and the Seanad. It is concerned with anything that would be appropriate and includes the ambit of office holders as defined in the Ethics in Public Office Act. If the Deputy thinks the code of conduct is concerned with anyone announcing or doing anything, I am not sure what he is complaining about. Is he complaining about office holders doing something or not doing something?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will be left with nobody in the Cabinet if he applies that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally the Deputy asks me why they are not taking action, but his question today seems to be concerned with what they are doing. To cover both sides, as the Deputy is doing, I will not amend the code of conduct to discipline people for doing their jobs &mdash; I certainly will not discipline them for something they have not done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Or do not intend to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will encourage them to do so. However, that does not come under a code of conduct or under the heading of ethics. To make it so would be stretching the ethics Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In the matter of amending the code of conduct, my question is to do with the changes that have been introduced by the Government in the area of health reform. A very powerful body, the national steering committee, has been established. Would it not be appropriate to amend the code of conduct to include members of this committee? For example, all the members apart from the chairman are senior civil servants, and I do not think anybody has a difficulty with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Deputy did not go into detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The only other person on this powerful body, which is driving the health service and taking responsibility for it, is the managing director of a pharmaceutical company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to him and anybody else fulfilling these very senior positions, would it not be desirable to have a code of conduct <Col N="1150"/>because otherwise there is bound to be a conflict of interest sooner or later?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made her point and she is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be necessary to have a code of conduct under the ethics legislation but the whole idea is that the code conforms fully with the statutory requirements. It is not easy to put into legislative terms what is right and wrong about the standards of conduct and integrity of office holders that are not expressly covered by legislation. I am not too sure if I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question correctly. Is she suggesting that the code should cover Members who are on various boards or committees? They are already covered. The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is currently considering a code to do with appointments to boards and the regulations that should apply, but it is not covered by the Ethics in Public Office Act which primarily governs what politicians should do. There is a code for advisers and board members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I gather from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response that he has no intention of either amending or improving the code of conduct. Is the Taoiseach therefore suggesting that we have a perfect code of conduct for office holders? Is he suggesting that there is no room for improvement and that he is completely satisfied with the present code of conduct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that. I am saying the code has been in existence for only eight months following a long discussion over approximately 18 months. I suggest that the code should at least be given time to run for a reasonable period before it is amended. It is too early for amendments. If there are good suggestions I suggest they be held until we review the code. Two Oireachtas committees reviewed the code over a long period as did the Standards in Public Office Commission which produced the code. It is not a codeof conduct produced by the Government but by the Standards in Public Office Commission following consultation with Members of this House in two separate committees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that under the existing code Ministers or Ministers of State contesting the European Parliament elections would be expected to resign their office at some point in advance of the elections? Will the Taoiseach say at what point he envisages that will happen? Will he state how he views the impact of the Kelly judgment on the same issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge and subject to my checking the code, that is not part of the code. It has not been done in any <Col N="1151"/>election by any members of any Government who were Ministers and Ministers of State and there have been many precedents in recent European Parliament elections<b>.</b></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the code?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think it is covered by the code.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What precedent is there under the code?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy states it is in the code but I do not think it is stated in the code that people must resign if they are candidates in a European election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first time we have had European elections under the code.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the first time we have had a code but not the first time we have had legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It would expedite the reshuffle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second question about the Kelly judgment, the application of the Kelly rules would now apply in any election. Any use of a Department or agency in an election would have to be taken into account for costs purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach examined or has caused to be examined the situation in other countries, particularly other countries that may have had trials, troubles and tribulations such as we have experienced in recent years? Does he think we could learn from the codes of conduct introduced or updated in those countries?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The types of codes used in many other countries were examined and discussed by the committees of the House. The assessment was that our legislation, our codes and the Cabinet Handbook, which was amended a few years ago, tend to be far more strict. Our compliance legislation, probably because it is new, is far tougher than in most countries in Europe, and so it should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The code mentions lobbyists and how they are an integral part of a functioning democracy. Is there a particular definition to which the Taoiseach may wish to refer in regard to lobbyists? Given that we understand legislation is required, should the heads of that legislation have been incorporated in the code in order that people can understand what is being referred to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Standards in Public Office Commission set out the code of conduct it made it clear that the code had to be read in <Col N="1152"/>conjunction with the legislation. The code spelled out clearly what it expected the conduct would be in various cases. One cannot claim that it is just a code of conduct. If any Member is questioned by the Standards in Public Office Commission or on any other matter of integrity about officeholders, the legislation is taken into account as is the code, even though it is a code of practice and is not legislatively based. One is deemed to be answerable to the code. The regulations are very specific. Anyone in breach of the code must answer to the Standards in Public Office Commission. The issue would be dealt with in the same way as if it was legislatively based. That was made absolutely clear. One cannot go into a hearing of the Standards in Public Office Commission and say that this is just a code of practice. It has been made absolutely clear that one is answerable to the code and any breach of the code would be taken as if it was legislation. Therefore, one is answerable to the code of practice. It would be different if it was a code of practice in industrial relations in the trade union movement. One is totally bound by the code. That is how it is read.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach agree that a further extension of the code of conduct should be considered in the context of Ministers releasing details of announcements pending to their own party representatives, sometimes 24 to 48 hours prior to other representatives in the House and that there is an inequality and inequity in practice by these Ministers? Does the Taoiseach consider that is inappropriate and that it is an issue that should be brought under the aegis of the code of conduct and the Standards in Public Office Commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The rules and standards are set out in the Cabinet Handbook on how people should deal with certain issues and it has to be complied with. I have often seen ministerial statements taken up by Members of the Opposition and used to great effect for their own benefit. I am not sure if that hinders anybody too much.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The national security committee, which is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs, the Garda and the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The committee continues to meet as required and members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments which might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</P>
        <P>It is concerned with ensuring that I and the Government are advised of high-level security issues and the responses to them, but not involving operational security issues. It would not be appropriate for me to disclose information about the work of the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government received a report last October from the emergency planning society which clearly criticised the piecemeal approach to planning for emergencies in Ireland. It recommended that since 11 September 2001, a single body with responsibility for security should be established and should report to the highest office in Government. Has the interdepartmental group established to monitor security and terrorist threats considered the report by the Emergency Planning Society? Does the Taoiseach accept the findings of the report which stated that weaknesses in Ireland&rsquo;s emergency planning were highlighted in the way the SARS threat was dealt with? The society also stated that the Government reaction to a possible nuclear threat highlighted the inadequacy of our preparations. I recall the former Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, sending a letter and two iodine tablets to every household in the country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any check been carried out on the whereabouts of the iodine tablets? Is it proposed to issue updated iodine tablets to every household again? Given that the US Government will apply a great deal of pressure to have Mr. bin Laden brought to heel before the US presidential election, has the interdepartmental group received any updated information on the possibility of nuclear threats in Britain which, obviously, would have an impact on Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Defence through the Office of Emergency Planning and the task force on emergency planning oversees emergency planning to promote the best possible use of State resources and to ensure compatibility between different emergency planning requirements. The Office of Emergency Planning is established on an administrative basis. It is appropriate, from time to time, to consider whether its work needs to be supported by a statutory framework regarding emergency planning, and this is what happens. The Government will consider any detailed proposals which the Minister, in light of experience, may wish to make in that regard.</P>
        <P>Emergency issues involve not only defence and security, but also health, transport and aviation. It is not possible and would not make sense to break these sectors away from their parent Departments and make them the responsibility of one agency. However, when Departments are required to co-operate or to have an input, they do so. This makes for much better functional operation of emergency planning arrangements.</P>
        <P>The report of the Emergency Planning Society, referred to by Deputy Kenny, envisages greater integration of emergency services by amalgamation of responsibility for managing energies into a single agency. As previously indicated, substantial costs would be associated with that approach. Moreover, responses to different types of emergency require different skills, experience and resources. For example, dealing with a marine oil pollution incident is different from reacting to a foot and mouth disease threat.</P>
        <P>One unit cannot do everything and, therefore, it is best that primary responsibility remains with the agency with the relevant know-how and expertise. Obviously, when experts are required, they will be brought in. The system is small enough to easily allow for that, as was the case in the context of foot and mouth disease and after 11 September 2001. The Minister for Defence previously welcomed the interest of the Emergency Planning Society and he has ensured its report had a wide circulation among Departments with emergency planning responsibilities, which was useful.</P><Col N="1155"/>
        <P>With regard to SARS, the Government is satisfied that the steps taken by the Minister for Health and Children and the health authorities were adequate, proportionate, balanced and, above all, successful. The Department of Health and Children continues to monitor the situation and will continue to initiate further appropriate action with regard to China, if necessary.</P>

	<P>I asked the Taoiseach whether an increased number of meetings of the high level group had been held or were planned during the Irish EU Presidency. It would be appropriate to know this and whether, in preparation for the visit of President Bush of the United States, an increased number of meetings will be required. Has there been an evaluation of the cost factor, given that in London additional security measures cost approximately £1 million per day? In our case garda&iacute; and soldiers will be used. Has this matter been examined? Obviously it will require some budgetary considerations as well as operational considerations on the ground.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Have any requests been made by the US for immunity for Secret Service agents and snipers? Such requests were made of the British authorities. Has the Government considered this? The British authorities were also asked about a sterile zone being created around President Bush in which only American security personnel would be given free rein, though I do not think the British acceded to that.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
        <P>Has the US made such requests and has the high level group discussed them? Will the Government make a decision on those matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The high level group deals with issues relating to 9/11 and international terrorism. It meets more or less monthly, though when necessary it met on a weekly basis. Last year it met eight times. There is a fairly well-run system operated by the US which deals with the matters raised by the Deputy and that system is demanding enough no matter who the President is. An advance party lays down very stringent regulations based on their reports on the assassination of John F. Kennedy 40 years ago. That party goes through the same procedures &mdash; I have seen it done many times &mdash; and that is the case on this occasion also. However, this is a <Col N="1156"/>matter for the Garda in the first instance and even if the force needs more back-up there is no real change here. The procedure is the same as that used for the visit of President Clinton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being provoked.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the way he described the national security committee gives us the image of a very shadowy body? Apart from the Secretary to the Government he has not told us who is on the committee apart from mentioning a number of Departments. Will he elaborate on that? Has the national security committee received communications from the US government on its wish to pressurise Irish airlines to provide US intelligence services with comprehensive lists of passengers flying to the US? Has the committee advised the Taoiseach of that? What are his views on that?</P>
        <P>Does the committee give the Taoiseach regular advice or briefings on his Government&rsquo;s facilitating the US war machine on an ongoing basis by continuing the use of Shannon to facilitate the US occupation of Iraq? What was the committee&rsquo;s advice on that matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no secret about the committee. It involves the Garda and the Army, so the Garda Commissioner and the Army Chief of Staff are on the committee, as are officials of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Transport and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. There is no secret about those matters.</P>
        <P>The committee does not monitor what is going on in Iraq. It deals with any threats to Ireland from international terrorism as well as any other information picked up by international security <Col N="1157"/>agencies of which we need to be aware. Nowadays there is more interest in and concern about those who move and who are involved with international terrorist organisations.</P>
        <P>The committee is all the time trying to improve our services and administration to deal with nuclear difficulties or any other major security difficulties. As I said, the Minister brought the Emergency Planning Society&rsquo;s report of last year to all Departments and many changes were made on the basis of that report to improve our system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the airlines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of airlines, in any issue of concern about aviation, they are involved any time we require it. As the Deputy knows, new security arrangements are in place for cockpits and in regard to carrying implements on aeroplanes. The United States has been pressing for new security arrangements in airports.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about an interview given by the Minister for Defence to Catherine Cleary of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 29 December 2002 in which he promised to set up a new secret intelligence body to deal with terrorists. He said: &ldquo;We have done a lot of work and there has been a great deal of co-operation between the various Departments.&rdquo; He said it was something he was considering and that he would come to a decision early in the new year. Has the Government come to a decision on that? Is it considered necessary to establish a new intelligence body to deal with terrorists or what is the status of that proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to that question is no. What was considered was to have better working relationships and better communications with, and better planning between the organisations I mentioned earlier, and that has happened. Obviously, it is administratively easier to do that and it does not require the resources necessary to set up a new agency. There is far better co-operation now between the international bodies and agencies. The supply and flow of information on organisations, individuals and movements is now totally different from that before 11 September 2001. From time to time, that puts pressure on the resources of the agencies but one does not need a new agency to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said in the same interview that that would be one of his priorities in preparation for the Presidency. Do I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that that notion is dead and the idea of us going around referring <Col N="1158"/>to the Minister for Defence as &ldquo;M&rdquo; or something like that is not likely to occur? Was it a Christmas time interview?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can take it that that is not necessary. On a serious note, the level of time taken up, because of international intelligence, on checking, planning and monitoring is different from what was the case. Something must give, admittedly. The Minister was referring to how one would handle that position in the event that it continued. Quite an amount of resources must be used, because of international intelligence, by far better resourced organisations than ours. Our regulations on the movement of people generally, how we monitor individuals who move or travel in the country, are nothing like those in other countries. I am not advocating that it should be either, but it means that existing security resources can be stretched by demands made upon them. Such resources have been greatly increased in many other countries, as well as by Interpol. The people who are monitoring these matters are feeding in information all the time, of which we receive quite an amount, although it is small compared to what is fed into the UK or France. Nonetheless, it is a new source of work for the existing agencies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach recall that in a written reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last month, he indicated that the interdepartmental group on national security was established in 1974 in the context of what he called &ldquo;the overspill of the Northern Ireland situation&rdquo;? In his reply, the Taoiseach also said that the group now focused almost exclusively on the security of Government buildings. Given that the Taoiseach used the term &ldquo;almost exclusively&rdquo;, does that mean that some part of the group&rsquo;s work continues, in effect, to address what he broadly referred to as &ldquo;the overspill of the Northern Ireland situation&rdquo;? If that is the case, will the Taoiseach please elaborate and outline to us exactly what he meant in that reply?</P>
        <P>With regard to my second question, as the high level group established in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department in the wake of the 11 September 2001 atrocities, continues to operate, has it considered wider matters of security and foreign policy? For instance, has the high level group considered the recent address by the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, to American troops massed at Shannon Airport? Has that matter been addressed? Did that action on the part of Mr. Rumsfeld have the prior approval of the Government? Did the Government give approval for that event to take place in our country and, if so, will the Taoiseach explain why? If approval was not given for the use of an Irish airport by Donald Rumsfeld to <Col N="1159"/>address US troops massed there, what action has the Taoiseach taken, on behalf of the people, to register disapproval of the event and its unacceptability, as well as to insist that it should not be repeated?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the public cannot take any great assurance from his responses today? Would he accept that the situation does not seem to have improved to any great degree since the time of the iodine debacle? The Taoiseach&rsquo;s replies are a bit like the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> keeping an eye on the Czar, whereas he is keeping an eye on Osama bin Laden.</P><Miles com="cl" par="110"/>
        <P>From the point of view of our EU Presidency, has the Taoiseach done anything to improve the security situation as far as the European Union and Ireland are concerned? To take a practical example, what would happen if a plane hijacked by terrorists was <i>en route</i> to Dublin? How would such an incident be dealt with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in a recent reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the national security committee is now dealing with far more international issues than heretofore. The committee would also have taken into account incidents on the Border and activities of that nature, but it does so far less now than previously. There are incidents on the Border and one of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues raised such an incident, involving incursions, in the House a few weeks ago.</P>
        <P>As regards Mr. Rumsfeld, a procedure has been set down by the Department of Transport. Any flights landing here, or fly-overs, have to go through that procedure and I am sure that in that case it did. The Deputy should table a question to the relevant Minister to obtain the details.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is wrong. After 11 September 2001, this country, like every other country, changed its procedures. Accident and emergency procedures were not in place nor was, the task force on emergency planning which oversees emergencies generally. That task force has introduced procedures, early detection and equipment and specialised staff have been trained. The position is entirely different. Like many things in the world, it is a pity there had to be such a tragedy for everybody to engage in such procedures. However, procedures, early detection and equipment that we did not have are available and both the Army and the Garda have been trained in emergency planning. We have different procedures from what we had even two years ago.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>I have no specific plans to alter the partnership structure or approach fundamentally to local and community development. However, the number and complexity of structures now involved is both extensive and complex and these arrangements can be confusing and present difficulties for the communities they are designed to serve. This is the reason for the review of the local and community development delivery structures, which I undertook with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I informed the House previously that, arising from the review, community and local development groups were asked to bring forward measures for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas by mid-year. This process will be co-ordinated by the local county and city development boards.</P>
        <P>With regard to funding of partnership companies, Deputies will be aware that Area Development Management Limited, ADM, manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department. ADM is appraising implementation plans for 2004-2006 and programmes of activities for 2004 from partnerships and community groups. Decisions on funding allocations for 2004 will be made by ADM in due course. Changes to the way in which the board of ADM is selected will not of themselves have implications for the funding of partnerships.</P><Col N="1161"/>
        <P>The Government appreciates the key role that ADM has had and continues to undertake in the delivery of successful local development services and programmes. The Government especially appreciates the work and commitment of board members, past and present, individually and collectively, in contributing to the many achievements of the company.</P>
        <P>The Indecon report, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, noted that ADM continues to perform well across key areas. However, the report also noted the context in which ADM operates has changed significantly since its inception &mdash; in particular, a shift from EU to Exchequer funding &mdash; and identified accountability issues arising from current structures. The report also proposed options to address these issues, among them that the Government would appoint the board, including the chairman</P>
        <P>The Government accepted the broad thrust of the report and that ADM should be restructured to better reflect the context and priorities that now obtain. I wrote to the chairman of the board seeking his co-operation and that of the board in giving effect to the Government decision on this matter and I followed this up through a meeting with him and the chief executive. I recently received a reply confirming the board&rsquo;s willingness to co-operate fully in the process of change arising from the Government decision. These changes will provide the company with an opportunity to enhance its key role in support and delivery of Government programmes to enable communities to tackle the problems of disadvantage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clarification of the issue. Does he accept partnership has played a major role in issues such as adult education and transport for the elderly in areas such as my own of Latton but that the budgetary position is so unclear that long-term commitments cannot be made? For instance, the Minster launched the transport initiative last year but the Lattion partnership received the same budget for nine months in 2003 as it did for 12 months this year.</P>
        <P>That is unworkable. It is being asked also to take responsibility for other areas. It finds it cannot plan on the education front.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it clear that it will be a political decision. As we have discussed and on most occasions agreed, we are elected to make decisions and manage Government expenditure.</P>

	<P>ADM exists. Is the Deputy proposing its dissolution?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is proposing to change the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am proposing, with the agreement of the board of ADM, to nominate three people to the board. I am charged with responsibility for managing the expenditure of the Exchequer funds provided for my Department and I do not see anything strange in the Minister having an input into decisions on spending money provided by his Department.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford asked whether ADM will receive a guaranteed allocation for a five year period. In my reply I referred to the three year plan from 2004 to 2006 which coincides with the second part of the national development plan. As the Deputy will be aware, this House decides on the Estimates each year and, therefore, there may be adjustments from year to year but, subject to that, a three year programme will be agreed.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to adult education and rural transport, but neither are funded primarily by my Department. Rural transport is funded by the Department of Transport and it uses ADM and the partnerships as a vehicle for delivering its work. I understand that the same amount of money is available this year as was available last year. Similarly, the Department of Education and Science has responsibility for educational funding, including adult education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred a moment ago to those who are elected to make decisions. Is the Minister trying to reverse the major advances in participative democracy, whereby local people contribute and influence local plans and whereby independent boards, free from political interference, distribute the funding?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister kowtowing to the wishes of local councillors and others who simply want to be the first with the news of the grant and so on, to have the letter the day before the announcement and perpetuate a system of client list politics? Does the Minister want to bring us back to the 1950s and 1960s where members of any voluntary, community or self-help group had to knock on the door of the local politician with their hand outstretched and saying, &ldquo;Please, sir, can I have some funding&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that ADM was established by the European Union because it recognised that an independent body free from political influence was required to distribute the money? The Minister quoted from the letter sent to some of the chief executives, a copy of which <Col N="1163"/>I have, referring to the major changes that have taken place, but does he accept that the major change is the shift from EU to Exchequer funding, and that is the reason for the changes he proposes to implement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly &mdash; there is no question. Indecon pointed out in its report that the structures in ADM were set up because of EU regulations. It is incorrect to say that the EU set up ADM but it is true that the EU, as co-funding body, insisted on rules for spending money which are no longer relevant as the body is now 100% State-funded. The role of ADM has changed somewhat as a result and, in the light of that, Indecon, an independent body, recommended that we change the structure of ADM. I am not proposing to nominate people directly on to the partnerships or any other such changes. The partnerships will continue as before.</P>
        <P>ADM is an intermediate body which provides many services for the State. Partnerships and service to partnerships is just one. It also delivers and manages the child care programme, the rural transport programme and the taxi hardship fund. This body is able to deliver on a number of State services and I expect that role to grow in future because, as explained previously, the Government has decided that, rather than establishing new bodies to perform new functions, existing bodies should be used. ADM is one of the multifunctional bodies that can take on different roles as the State decides and, in that case, it is not strange that the Minister nominates the board.</P>
        <P>I have always acted properly and in accordance with the legislation. The Deputy would want to read the legislation before jumping to conclusions as to whether I acted properly. I am happy that, in every case, I have acted properly in regard to the boards that answer to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister does not act properly, but Ministers may change and one never knows who will be in office. Has the outgoing board failed to deliver or are there other reasons for the structural changes in ADM?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to EU rules on funding. Does he accept that those rules were good and we should keep them because no organisation is 100% perfect? According to the Minister&rsquo;s blurb, ADM has performed efficiently and would he not accept, therefore, that we should keep the organisation we have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy with ADM, but everything can change and improve and circumstances change. The role and circumstances of ADM are shifting quite rapidly. Where jobs need to be done for the State in future, they will be done by ADM. That is different from the original role which was purely <Col N="1164"/>to deal with co-funded schemes. It was suggested by independent consultants that, given the changed role, the structures would change. That is reasonable.</P>
        <P>Most politicians find it frustrating that they are saddled with the blame when things go wrong, even if they do not have control or the power to nominate members to boards. We are saddled with the blame if decisions do not go the way the people want them to go. I am a great believer that those elected who serve in Government have a responsibility for departmental expenditure. To put such a distance between the Government and the body responsible for spending money that the Government loses control is to detach the people from their money. I do not think it is right to detach the taxpayers&rsquo; from their money.</P>

        <Quest>the proposals he has to form a task force for the Irish language; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I announced recently, I intend to establish an Irish language advisory committee, coiste comhairleach na Gaeilge, and to appoint the members of the committee before Easter. The State and those organisations working with it to promote the Irish language should have a clear vision of their role and a practical plan which sets out their role in promoting the language.</P>
        <P>The role of the advisory committee will be to advise me on the advisability of preparing a 20 year strategic plan with realistic goals for the Irish language in the State, the short-term strategic priorities for the preservation and promotion of the Irish language within the State, the priorities regarding the implementation of the Official Languages Act, and the best and most practical ways to achieve progress in the implementation of that work. Arising from that, it is hoped that there will be an integrated approach among the main community and State organisations that promote the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The advisory committee will not prepare a report but will advise me on Irish language policy. I anticipate that the committee will also assist in bringing a greater degree of co-ordination to the work of the various parties engaged in supporting and promoting the Irish language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister was present at T&oacute;stal na Gaeilge in Galway recently where Dr. Peadar &Oacute; Flatharta was quoted to the effect that the lack of a national policy meant the work of language maintenance had lost focus and energy. He said Government had to draft a national policy for the language and referred to the urgent need to rethink entirely the State&rsquo;s Irish language infrastructure. While I would normally welcome the establishment of an advisory committee or board, Dr. &Oacute; Flatharta <Col N="1165"/>was looking for something more. He sought the establishment of a task force. A task force is given a task, which in this case should be to draft a new policy for the language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>With coiste comhairleach na Gaeltachta we found we were able to get the various players around a table. Not only did those who promoted ideas participate in putting them forward, they were also the players who would have to implement them. The danger with grandiose plans &mdash; and we have seen some of those in this House &mdash; is that while they may include everything, they may have been made without the engagement of the bodies who will have to deliver on them. I have been able to move forward so fast with the Coimisi&uacute;in na Gaeltachta report because I brought the players around the table when its implementation was being discussed.</P>
        <P>My intention in this case is to establish the coiste comhairleach. Its members will be there to represent organisations rather than as individuals. I will try to get the key players around a table to provide a concerted view as to how we shall proceed. The national policy of successive Governments has been to extend the daily use of Irish. As we all know where we would like to be, the question is how to get there. While the coiste might not solve all our problems, it might give us some idea of the proper steps to be taken to achieve our goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge everything the Minister has said, there is an urgency about coming up with a national policy. The point Dr. &Oacute; Flatharta made was that we should rethink the entire State infrastructure. It does not necessarily follow that those who are part of the current infrastructure should be the ones to draft a new policy. There is a great deal to be said for putting together a group which has a commitment to the language but whose members do not belong to the existing infrastructure. Clearly, the current structures have failed to deliver anything like what we would all like to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee will simply advise on policy. My Department will draft it as it is responsible for policy making. It is a good idea to obtain the advice and criticism of the various players to whom one will turn to implement a policy. While a policy drawn up on the basis of an academic exercise might be fantastic in theory, it may fail to recognise the limited nature of resources, focus and power. It is vital when drafting policy to take on board the views of the various players involved. The committee will be made up of representatives of the statutory agencies, including Foras na Gaeilge. We will also look to Irish language organisations for their input through Comhdh&aacute;il Naisiunta na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>We will bring statutory and non-statutory bodies together and they will give their advice. <Col N="1166"/>The policy, however, must be drawn up by the Government, which has that responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge what the Minister is saying, I strongly put to him the view that the task force should draft a policy. The Government may then endorse, reject or amend it. A task force which introduces fresh thinking will yield the best result in terms of a draft policy. The task force should be set the objective of coming up with a draft policy within a certain time frame. The process the Minister has outlined this evening is one which will continue indefinitely while producing nothing original or worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it strange that the Deputy should say that. I heard the same criticism when I established the coiste comhairleach na Gaeltachta to implement the recommendations of the report of Coimisi&uacute;in na Gaeltachta. I was checking yesterday and discovered that significant progress has been made on a great number of those recommendations.</P>
        <P>All of us stand for election and some of us might remember when we did so for the first time. We all had policies and we were entering politics to implement new ideas.</P>

	<P>We come to this House and then say we should switch off those ideas and ask someone who was not elected to think some up. While I am always open to new ideas, I entered this House because I already had ideas I wanted to act on. I can point to many ideas I had about the islands, Gaeltachta&iacute; and Gaeilge which I have put into force since becoming Minister. My answer to Deputy O&rsquo;Shea is that I entered politics to implement the ideas I picked up and which I put before the electorate. While I am open to a good idea from any source, be it a person on the street or a group, I became a politician to implement the vision my colleagues and I had for the country.</P>

	<P>I would appreciate answers from the Minister to supplementary questions</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the dormant accounts disbursement board. The board is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board is currently deciding how to disburse up to &euro;30 million. At its meetings on 19 December 2003 and 17 February 2004, the board approved 18 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;1.7 million. The details of these approvals, including the names of the individual organisations involved as well as the specific grant amounts follow in tabular form. The board will next meet on 16 March 2004 when it is anticipated that a further list of projects will be submitted to it.</P>
        <P>Given the emerging size of the fund, existing legislative provision is inadequate. Shortcomings are evident on a number of fronts. There is no explicit provision for a properly developed organisational structure to support the board. Current arrangements, which involve a handful of seconded civil servants in a secretariat role, are not designed to support disbursements on the scale now emerging. Existing provision requires that a part-time chairman should be wholly accountable for expenditure running into hundreds of million of euros which is, clearly, unsustainable. Existing arrangements do not adequately support the aligning of expenditure by the dormant accounts board with policy priorities debated in this House and approved by Government.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about tackling disadvantage, we must target resources. There is a considerable wealth of expertise and practical experience residing in public bodies which routinely deal with areas of disadvantage and disability. Current arrangements do not adequately allow this key <Col N="1168"/>resource to inform decisions on expenditure from the fund. These alone were the reasons the Government reviewed arrangements for dormant accounts in December 2003. In view of these issues, it was apparent there were two possible routes that could be followed. One was to set up an independent agency with a large staff, CEO, offices etc., to administer the fund. The other was to use the existing mechanisms of State and accounting procedures, including accounting officers of different Departments, to support clear criteria, a transparent application process, and rigorous evaluation of projects.</P>
        <P>The first approach would have led to an inordinate amount of the fund being dissipated on administration. Implicit in the second route, using existing agencies was the requirement that Departments or their agencies would support and inform the disbursement of funds. The advantage of using the existing infrastructure of State to carry out this work is that much less of the money than otherwise would be the case will be spent on overheads and administration, and the benefit or the expertise of the whole State system will be available for the evaluation of projects. Under this, legal responsibility for decisions would ultimately lie with the relevant Minister and accounting responsibility with the relevant accounting officers.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the disbursements scheme &mdash; as set out in the board&rsquo;s first disbursement plan &mdash; will remain unchanged. It is focused on funding to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons, namely, those affected by economic and social disadvantage, those affected by educational disadvantage, and persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>As regards the integrity of the proposed future system for disbursement, it is important to note that the Government decision of December 2003 provides that decisions in this area would be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process. With regard to the board itself, the Government proposes key roles for it, with particular regard to advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding, and preparation of the disbursement plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the board will critically assess the additionality and impact of spend on a regular basis. This is of critical importance and arrangements will be put in place to ensure that spending under the Dormant Accounts Board will be kept separate from the normal Estimates process, so that additionality can be verified. Draft legislation is to be brought forward this year with a view to giving effect to these decisions. I expect the draft legislation will be published over the coming months. The proposed improved arrangements will lead to much better governance and improved impact and will secure and enhance accountability to the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="1169"/>

	<P>I have never heard such rubbish in all my life. It is clear that ADM has the full knowledge and support of the community and voluntary sectors. As the board stands, ADM assesses all applications. An assistant secretary from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department is a member of the board. Therefore, the Department is fully cognisant and knowledgeable in every aspect of the decisions the board takes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has given us a list detailing how the board has disbursed &euro;1.6 million. It was notified to the public and Members at the same time. When the Minister of State brings forward his legislation, this will become the Minister&rsquo;s stroke list. It will then be for the Minister to decide and his deputies will inform the public. The credibility of the applications will be in question as it will become a slush fund. In 2001 the Minister for Finance said this should not be allowed to become a slush fund. Is the Minister of State not ashamed about what he is doing? Does he not feel it is disgraceful that he will manipulate and stroke &euro;400 million so that the Minister and his minions on the county councils will inform community groups that they have been so good to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>It could have been left alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy had his say. We might have left it alone. However, in three or four years&rsquo; time the Comptroller and Auditor General would complain that the system is deficient. The system that was set up was not sufficient for the fund that is available. We are using ADM to process the cases. Spending and accounting for the money is a different matter. There must be proper management, governance and procedures. This is down the road.</P>
        <P>While we could have done this by establishing a new body, all parties have often said there are too many organisations and independent bodies <Col N="1171"/>duplicating work that could be carried out with the expertise within Departments and State organisations. We should be careful about setting up new organisations. We have looked at this matter and consider the best way to proceed is to use the skill and expertise of Departments and their accounting officers.</P>
        <P>From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, what was set up was deficient. The part-time chairman would be accountable for large funds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The part-time chairman happened to be a senior barrister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>He may well be, and while I am not casting any doubt on his ability, he was part-time. A proper structure is required when we are spending, controlling and governing a couple of hundred million euros. This is what we are trying to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sad that by 9 March 2004 only &euro;1.6 million has been disbursed. There is obviously a problem. To paraphrase Deputy McCreevy when the legislation was before the House, the dormant accounts disbursement board was put in place to prevent these moneys becoming a slush fund. It cannot be denied that this was seen to be the fairest method.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that the board cannot be strengthened. There is also a cost factor if civil servants in other Departments are working on these applications. The State is already paying for their time. The public sees this for what it is. The money in question belongs to the community and is not Exchequer money in any sense. Many of the people that held these accounts are dead and there are no apparent heirs.</P>
        <P>If there is a deficiency in the operation of the board, and there obviously is, it will not be solved by giving the final decision to the Government. Will the recommendations go to Cabinet where it will add to or take from them? The statement indicated the Government will make the decisions. Does this mean the Cabinet will take the final decisions or will it be the Minister? Whatever way it emerges, this is the wrong road to travel. The Government saw the crock of gold and decided to grab it so that it could manipulate votes at election times.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is entirely untrue. The board ran advertisements and has allocated &euro;1.6 million. It has the authority to allocate up to &euro;30 million within the year. Last year, it spent some months in drawing up a disbursement plan that was submitted to the Department and approved. There are no difficulties and the applications are being processed.</P><Col N="1172"/>
        <P>The role of the board will change. However, it will still advise Government and review, evaluate and monitor allocations. We will have the best of both worlds.</P>

        <Quest>when he expects to see the publication of the first annual report of the national drugs strategy considering it has been in existence for almost three years; the reason this report did not meet its deadline for publication by the end of 2003 as promised in his Department&rsquo;s strategy statement for 2003-05; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001- 08 and is preparing a report which will cover the first three years of the strategy. This comprehensive report will present an overview of progress made to the end of 2003 and will address issues such as progress in the implementation of the 100 actions contained in the strategy, the structures involved in delivering the strategy and the nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland. It will also include the latest available statistics on treatment, seizures and data from relevant surveys and research <Miles com="ah"/>undertaken in the period.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
        <P>Delays were experienced in obtaining up-to-date statistical information from a number of sources which has delayed the overall preparation of a report. I am anxious that it be published as quickly as possible. I have asked the Department to expedite this matter and I hope it will be published in the next three months.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that updates on the drugs strategy, the local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund are included in the annual report of the Department. In addition, the national advisory committee on drugs recently produced a comprehensive progress report covering its work from July 2000 to July 2003 which has been widely circulated.</P>
        <P>Since the national drugs strategy was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies in implementing the actions set out in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving their set targets and obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings. Approximately one third of the 100 actions have been completed or are ongoing for the life of the strategy. With the exception of a few actions where work has yet to commence, work is in progress on the remainder.</P><Col N="1174"/>
        <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the co-ordination of the national drugs strategy, I present a six-monthly progress report on the implementation of the strategy to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which reviews performance against targets set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P el="5">The critical implementation path is in the final stages of publication and will be ready for broad dissemination in the next few days. The critical implementation path is a step-by-step plan showing how Departments and agencies are fulfilling, and intend to fulfil, their commitments and actions under the strategy. It also lays out the path to be taken for each Department and agency to meet their objectives.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. However, one of the main reasons for this delay has been the considerable length of time spent in setting up the regional drugs task forces. I am unhappy that it has taken so long to get a report. The nature of the drug problem is changing with the increasing use of cocaine as opposed to heroin. How is the Minister of State addressing this matter? The increase in cocaine use is of increasing concern to people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>All ten regional drugs task forces have been operating for some months. They are assessing problems in their relevant areas and identifying gaps in the strategy. The regional drugs task forces are now reporting back. We accept that drug use is no longer just a Dublin-wide problem. The heroin problem was mainly Dublin based but there were still 2,000 users outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority region. I agree that drug use is changing. The heroin problem is not exactly under control but there are 7,000 people in treatment for heroin use. However, I agree that the strategy must always be adjusted as new drugs and problems come on the scene. There will be a mid-term evaluation of the strategy later this year. This will give us the opportunity to see whether the strategy is still relevant, needs serious alteration or is flexible enough to tackle new problems, such as cocaine use, which are arising.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A report released yesterday showed Irish people under 30 years spend an average of 9% of their income on alcohol compared to the next high spenders, the Swedes, at 1.9%. Irish people spend almost 4% of the their weekly household income on alcohol compared to 0.2% of the rest of the EU. Will the Minister of State accept that alcohol is the largest drug used in Ireland? Its use has repercussions in <Col N="1175"/>terms of street violence, property damage, family discord and links to suicide.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State agree to the incorporation of alcohol use in the national drugs strategy at its mid-term review? The drugs issue has changed and alcohol has come more to the fore. Statistics show that alcohol is consumed by all age groups. The only age group in this report shown to be at the EU average is the 55 to 64 year age group. However, of the over 65 year bracket, 62% drink regularly compared to an average 28% in the rest of Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>When the local drugs task forces were originally set up, they were concentrated in 14 of the most disadvantaged areas where heroin was the big issue. Seven years ago in Dublin if it was suggested to a local drugs task force to take responsibility for alcohol, there would have been an expression of shock-horror as it would have been felt the Government was downplaying the importance of heroin use. However, things have changed. With regard to the regional drugs task forces, some argue that the biggest problem outside Dublin is alcohol use and not drugs.</P>
        <P>The national drugs strategy covers illegal drugs. There is a separate strategy for alcohol, which is under the control of the Minister for Health and Children. When I speak of the four pillars of the national drugs strategy, there is an overlap with prevention of drug and alcohol misuse. When one speaks to school children on prevention, these two issues overlap. However, they are covered by two different strategies. The alcohol strategy also differs from the national drugs strategy because alcohol affects different age groups and classes in society. The national drugs strategy is aimed at disadvantaged areas and people in particular age groups. Perhaps in time, the two strategies will come together. Currently, they overlap in terms of prevention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall in the mid-1990s, in Amsterdam for example, heroin addicts were looked on as losers. They were seen as a product of the 1960s when film stars and others were into this drug. One pattern that emerged in Amsterdam at the time was people getting their trips on more readily available proprietary drugs. Is there a significant increase in the use of proprietary drugs instead of heroin? Anecdotal stories about cocaine use would lead us to believe that there is a significant supply of cocaine <Col N="1176"/>throughout the State. How bad is the spread of cocaine use?</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that in some disadvantaged areas, heroin is sometimes perceived as a loser&rsquo;s drug. Last year&rsquo;s survey showed that there were fewer people in the 15 to 24 year old bracket using heroin in Dublin. Sadly, they are probably not out playing football and have probably moved on to other drugs, but fewer young people in Dublin are moving on to heroin. There is a great deal of poly-drug use, in which people use anything and everything, legal or illegal, such as alcohol and a mix of whatever is available. The days in which people used and abused one drug have gone, and a certain section of society is using whatever is going, so some proprietary drugs and drugs that are dispensed by chemists are also being used.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The overall national population survey was carried out last year, and I remember one aspect of the results was that major misuse of illegal drugs occurred among men when they were in their 20s. As they got older, they did not use illegal drugs to the same extent and probably used legal drugs such as alcohol. Women went almost the other way. The use of illegal drugs by women in their 20s was much lower than that by men in their 20s, but the use of legal drugs, namely, valium and such benzodiazepines, was extremely high among women as they got into their 40s, 50s or 60s. That does not come under my strategy, but there is no doubt that poly-drug use is a major issue, with people playing with and dabbling in whatever is available.</P>

        <Quest>the total estimated number of heroin abusers at the latest date for which figures are available, in Dublin and the rest of the country for each of the past five years; the steps being taken to counter such extensive heroin use, especially in the context of the implementation of the national drugs strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Question 106 touches on some of the issues with which we were just dealing. In May 2003, a study was published by the national advisory committee on drugs, which estimated that there are 14,452 opiate users in Ireland. This estimate was based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001: the central drug treatment list, Garda data and the hospital in-patient data. This was the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since 1996. However, it should be noted that the 1996 study, which arrived at an estimate of less than 13,500, estimated prevalence for Dublin only. The latest study estimates that there are 12,456 opiate users in Dublin, with a further 2,225 users outside the capital. The Deputy should note that the Dublin <Col N="1177"/>and outside Dublin figures do not add up to the national total as all three figures are the result of separate statistical calculations and are performed independently of each other.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the drop in prevalence figures in Dublin is encouraging. Equally encouraging is the finding that the numbers of users in the 15 to 24 year old bracket has reduced substantially, which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse. In this context, the Deputy should note that, since 1996, the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased significantly and this may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. For example, in 1996, 1,350 places were available on the central methadone treatment list, whereas currently there are approximately 6,900, which is ahead of the figure that we have in the strategy.</P>
        <P>While many of the study&rsquo;s findings are encouraging, I strongly believe that we cannot afford any degree of complacency. The Government is committed to working in partnership with communities most affected by drug misuse, and the continued implementation of the 100 actions set out in the national drug strategy remains a priority. In broad terms, the strategy seeks to increase the seizures of heroin and other drugs and to expand the availability of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes while also conducting more focused initiatives through the task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund in areas where drug use, especially heroin, is most prevalent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P  el="5">The strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State that it is encouraging that there seems to be a fall-off in the use of heroin in Dublin but, unfortunately, heroin use has spread to other areas. The Minister of State rightly says that we cannot be complacent about that in any way. I recall from the rehabilitation services in Amsterdam that heroin addicts reached a point at which they no longer got the buzz from heroin. That point allowed a window in which to effect rehabilitation. Otherwise the addicts would find alcohol as substitute which meant that there was no progress. That ties into what Deputy Keaveney talked about.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State does not seem to have figures for cocaine or crack cocaine. The problem with cocaine, as he knows, is that the trip does not last as long as it does with heroin. That means <Col N="1178"/>that the need to acquire the money to feed a habit will lead to the development of a higher level of crime.</P>
        <P>I assume that the Minister of State does not have any figures on the development of the use of proprietary drugs. The fact that heroin use in Dublin is declining is welcome, but I imagine that the Minister of State is concerned, as I am, that some substitute for heroin might be lining up for addicts to use and that the fact is not that the drug-abusing fraternity is diminishing, but its preferences are changing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Cocaine use is increasing, although as the national population survey shows, the figures are quite low. The survey showed that 3.1% of the population had used cocaine, 1.1% had used it in the past 12 months, and 0.3% had used it in the past month. Compared with similar surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that cocaine use in Ireland is roughly average, or perhaps slightly above average. It appears that cocaine use is a growing problem. These are the national figures including all age groups, but they would include more younger people.</P>
        <P>Those who misuse heroin come to notice quite quickly because it is injected and the problem is more in your face. The problem is that, although there is a treatment for heroin users, namely, methadone, which we have encouraged over a number of years, there is no equivalent of methadone for cocaine. Cocaine has serious effects on the user&rsquo;s memory and mental state, but it is a much longer-term problem which does not manifest itself as quickly as heroin use would. The illness problems do not arise as quickly, so users may be seriously affected without indication. There is no substitute treatment; all that we have is counselling and behavioural therapy. Cocaine users are much slower to come forward for treatment because we cannot give them a substitute and they do not recognise that they have a problem, which is itself probably part of the problem.</P>
        <P>We must monitor cocaine use. We are upskilling some of our staff in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There is a special clinic within the city clinic to deal with people who come forward, but the problem is getting them to come forward. We must adapt the strategy, our staff and our expertise as the problem evolves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that, in every second level school in which there are children aged over 15, at least one person in each class, which should have at least 30 students, has taken cocaine, that the incidence is one in 20 and that the age cohort in which cocaine is most used is the 15 to 24 age group? It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to say that there is a low level of uptake of treatment when he does nothing about it and has no strategy to deal with cocaine abuse. The problem will get much worse <Col N="1179"/>and, if the Minister of State does not deal with it, it will be much worse than the alcohol problem. Does cocaine mixed with alcohol not result in the fiercest and most violent assaults in our country? Is the Minister of State not too complacent about the issue and does he not have any real plans or finance to deal with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that the figure of one in 20 of our schoolchildren having used cocaine is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact. It is a fact in that age cohort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Different types of surveys exist. The national advisory committee on drugs did an extremely detailed nationwide survey, which involved in-depth interviews, lasting 30 to 40 minutes, in people&rsquo;s homes. Those are the figures on which we are going.</P>
        <P>Other surveys have been done, including the Sl&aacute;n survey, which is done in a classroom setting with people handing out and filling in forms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is not familiar with his brief. He has it wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want to ignore any survey but I believe more in the surveys that are done in people&rsquo;s homes than in those done in a peer group setting, in which everybody is acting macho and asking each other what they wrote. However, I agree with the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, this is the health research board report. It does not consist of silly answers from students. It is based on facts. The Minister of State does not seem to know this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The results come from the Sl&aacute;n surveys. I am not ignoring them; I am just saying we regard our other survey as more professionally done. I am not complacent. I realise the dangers of poly-drug use, which is a serious problem. Mixing together heroin, cocaine and alcohol or anything else can result in a violent reaction. Many people are unaware of this. We all have different personalities and physical make-ups and this is a factor in what happens.</P>
        <P>That is the problem with cocaine. It is harder to get through to people that they are seriously damaging their memory and mental state. Some people might be able to dabble and then walk away while others will suffer serious long-term effects. People are slower to realise that something is having a long-term effect because they think they are just having a great time. It can take some years to see the damage resulting from cocaine use. We can only get around this by working on the basis of prevention. We must educate people. We need campaigns to make <Col N="1180"/>people aware of the damage they can cause to themselves. Ultimately, we cannot have a policeman, nurse or health board worker on everybody&rsquo;s shoulder. People must be responsible for their own well-being and health. However, we are trying to give them the knowledge they need to make informed choices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>In most other European countries, a larger number of cocaine addicts present for treatment &mdash; up to 20% or 30%. Here, 1% of addicts present for treatment under the Minister of State&rsquo;s strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be that things are happening later in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is doing nothing about it. He is sitting back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes we can be of the view that only people who are less well off dabble heavily in drugs. Some of the anecdotal evidence that has come my way, however, suggests there is a significant number of well-off people who use cocaine as a leisure drug at the weekend. These people would not turn up in the Department&rsquo;s statistics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. Heroin has always been associated with disadvantage. This resulted in the establishment of the local drugs task forces. Cocaine has always existed but was considered a drug for the professional classes who used it on a Friday or Saturday night and were fine again by Monday morning. We have had greater problems with cocaine recently because more of it is available and it is cheaper. This means others are using it and perhaps mixing it with heroin or other substances. It is not just the poor or disadvantaged who suffer major problems as a result of drug use. Middle-class and professional people also have these problems, but such problems are slower to manifest themselves. That is why our educational programmes in schools and so on are targeted at all young people instead of being specific to certain areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach and his inconsistent band of amnesiacs back from Disneyland, which they visited last weekend. I welcome them back to the reality that stalks the streets. The problems of the North Eastern Health Board have become symptomatic of what is wrong with the health sector under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s governance. There has been a litany of serious events in this health board area: the misconduct of a senior gynaecologist in Drogheda which affected the lives of dozens of women; the problems in Monaghan General Hospital such as the death of baby Bronagh Livingstone and the birth of another young girl on the way to Cavan General Hospital; and the problems in Cavan hospital which included the tragic death of a child following a routine operation and interpersonal rows. There have been 15 cases in Cavan hospital of what were officially called adverse clinical incidents but to the public were medical mistakes which have resulted in suffering for patients.</P>
      <P>These are the realities of the health service: the failures, shortages, inaccessibility, inequity, queuing and misery facing patients who are on trolleys day in, day out. They are compounded by the false promises made by the Taoiseach and members of the Government in recent years. It is now obvious that members of the Government are prepared to say, do and promise anything to stay in power.</P>
      <P>On 7 May 2002 the Taoiseach made a specific commitment to the people. He said that Fianna F&aacute;il would permanently end hospital waiting lists within two years irrespective of any downturn in the economy. That promise left no room for <Col N="1182"/>doubt. The words used were not &ldquo;seriously reduce&rdquo; or &ldquo;dramatically reduce&rdquo;; they were &ldquo;permanently end&rdquo;. In the 22 intervening months the numbers on waiting lists have increased by at least 2,000.</P>
      <P>It was the height of hypocrisy and the ultimate in brass neck for the Taoiseach to state, while speaking in this House and to the nation last weekend, that his Government would permanently end waiting lists. When did he understand that this promise would not be met? How can people believe a word that comes out of his mouth when speaking of the area that is now of greatest concern to everybody, the health sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have recently answered a number of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s questions about staffing problems and personnel difficulties in Cavan. I do not need to go back over that because I have outlined the action that is to take place. The Deputy referred in two of his questions to the surgery department of Cavan General Hospital. Following the introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme in July 2002, all health care organisations are required to collect information on incidents and report them to the clinical indemnity insurance organisation. Of the 750 incidents reported in 2003 in respect of Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, the health board&rsquo;s risk adviser recommended that the views of a consultant be obtained in 15 of those cases which were treated in the surgery department of Cavan General Hospital. The board&rsquo;s medical adviser was requested to carry out a review of those incidents on 4 March.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny has referred to the report published by the North Eastern Health Board. The board published the medical adviser&rsquo;s report, which contained a number of recommendations in the area of surgical services in the hospital. The Minister is meeting the chief executive officer of the board today to discuss the report&rsquo;s findings and the board&rsquo;s response to its recommendations. As I stated in the House he would, the Minister also recently met the medical board of Cavan General Hospital about a number of service issues with the hospital. The medical board has a range of proposals in this regard and these are the subject of discussion with the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding and waiting lists, the Government has continually increased the funding in the Department of Health and Children. The figures are well known. More than &euro;10 billion was granted for this year which is an increase of 10%. Based on the projected figures, hospital activity has risen to almost an estimated one million in-patients, an increase of almost 200,000. As regards the national treatment fund, 10,000 patients have been treated over the past two years. There has been a 42% reduction in the number of adults waiting for more than twelve months for in-patient treatment, based on the latest figures available for the period September <Col N="1183"/>2002 to September 2003. There has been a 39% reduction in the number of children waiting for more than six months in the same period. Waiting times have been halved for adults and children from one year to six months.</P>
      <P>Under the health strategy framework for the next seven to ten years, 75% of the actions have commenced after year one. On bed capacity, primary care, staffing, cancer and disabilities, physical and sensory disability and mental health, I can show the House figures that have dramatically increased. Rather than berate me about these issues, Deputy Kenny should say we have done an enormous amount in a relatively short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>People waiting for orthodontic treatment and those whose community home help hours have been cut will be shocked by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s admission. He did not answer the charge made against him. On 7 May 2002, the Taoiseach stated, &ldquo;We will permanently end waiting lists.&rdquo; With less than 60 days to go, the lists have increased by 2,000. That is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s kind of Government and that is why the people do not believe him any more. He made other promises. He said he would issue 200,000 extra medical cards; he has withdrawn 45,000 since. He promised 3,000 additional beds and he has closed 200 beds in Dublin. He promised enhanced GP services in a range of multi-disciplinary paramedical services. Does the Taoiseach not understand that the people do not believe him?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the questions? Does he remember &mdash; his memory is selective these days &mdash; making a promise to permanently end waiting lists? He stated last weekend that there would be full medical care in all hospitals on a 24-hour basis. Does that mean full accident and emergency cover or does it mean just a doctor and a nurse at the end of a telephone? Will the Taoiseach answer those questions clearly so that at least in this forum there can be some semblance of credibility on the words that come out of his mouth?</P>

	<P>I too wish to raise the event of the weekend and the political implications arising therefrom. Can we now take it that the Taoiseach has turned his back and walked away from Hanly? He truthfully now, apparently, told the House that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, was right all along and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, remains wrong. I ask the Taoiseach about the waiting lists and the commitment to which Deputy Kenny has referred, that within two years of 6 May 2002, he would have cleared the waiting lists. Is the Taoiseach still trying to wriggle out of that commitment set out in black and white? Is he now stating, as he stated last Sunday night, that the abolition of the waiting lists will never happen?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain what his Minister for Finance meant when he said he would bring proposals to Government to control the costs of tribunals. I understand why he might wish to divert attention from the proceedings at certain tribunals but surely this is the same Minister for Finance who cleared the proposal from the then Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, that we increase the allowance to lawyers by &euro;800 per day? What proposals will he bring to Government? Do they involve legislation and when will they be brought before Government?</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach about the discovery of &euro;600 million to renovate the Red Cow roundabout and the M50. That proposal has been there since before the Luas works started. The Taoiseach now proposes to embark on a new project that will cause three years of further disruption after the completion of Luas and after the nonsense from the Minister for Transport about putting Luas on stilts has been abandoned.</P>
      <P>On the &euro;1 million from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for families, is this the same woman who took &euro;57 million from the weakest and most vulnerable families in our society with the abolition of the rent subsidy whereby families will be deprived of a roof over their heads? We make a meal of &euro;1 million for families in marginal constituencies, or maybe the same families that will benefit from the &euro;1 million provided by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. It would not put in two playgrounds in the entire country at a time when there are families who admittedly <Col N="1186"/>might never vote, but who are at the very bottom of the ladder, who are being hurt every day by what the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan did, the most right-wing Minister we have seen since the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a range of questions. In the welfare budget we are spending &euro;11.5 billion. They are some of the best and biggest increases ever in various areas of the social welfare budget. Deputy Rabbitte asked whether we have moved away from the Hanly report. The Hanly report is still part of the reform package of the Department of Health and Children. It is claimed that Hanly ignored or placed insufficient emphasis on access to services for patients outside major population areas.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the weekend events, I have been listening to some of the arguments of people opposed to Hanly. It is baffling how anyone can suggest that a doubling of consultant numbers and an increase in services in the regions can be seen as a slowing down. I was baffled by that over the weekend. The Hanly report does not recommend centralisation of acute hospital care into a few large hospitals or the downgrading of hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>Some of the issues put forward at the weekend are not true. The claims that some of the Hanly report&rsquo;s conclusions are based on a limited number of sources and that the group misinterpreted their findings, is entirely inaccurate. As I have already said, on the latest figures up to September 2003, there was a 42% reduction in the number of adults on the waiting list for more than 12 months and a 39% reduction in the number of children waiting for more than six months. Over 10,000 patients were treated by the national treatment purchase fund.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach believe all that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the Red Cow roundabout, it is obvious Deputy Rabbitte did not watch the Minister for Transport, Deputy <Col N="1187"/>Brennan, at the weekend. If so, he would have heard the Minister say that, as part of the proposals, he was bringing forward the &euro;46 million that was required to start the work on the Red Cow roundabout as soon as possible to deal with improvements in that area. That work will be done long before the other overall work. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will be glad to see the doubling of the lanes on the M50 and also the access roads and some other work which will enhance the M50 which now deals with a greater volume of traffic than when it opened a decade ago.</P>

Is Hanly engaged on a fool&rsquo;s errand, doing further work when the Taoiseach has already abandoned the thrust of his policy? What does the Taoiseach mean when he says &ldquo;medical cover will be provided&rdquo;? Does that mean that an accident and emergency consultant will be available to patients brought in through casualty, or does it not?</P>

      <P>I listen very carefully to what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, says and I get plenty of opportunities to hear him, because there are two press releases per day. The last time he was putting stilts at the Red Cow roundabout and now, when the works are within four or five months of being finished, he will start a new project that will take three years. He blames his predecessor. She says he should shut up and get on with it. This is the array of promises that was made at the weekend. The Taoiseach fooled the people in June 2002 but he will not be able to fool them a second time.</P>

	<P>I would never threaten a woman, a Cheann Comhairle, so please do not do it on my behalf. When the Taoiseach leaves Dublin airport next week to visit the United States, unfortunately I cannot be on the tarmac to wave him off. Therefore, I must ask him now, if it is his intention to confirm the invitation to President Bush to visit Ireland at the end of June and, if so, on whose behalf will he extend that invitation? Does he presume to do so on behalf of the Irish people, a large majority of whom opposed his criminal invasion of Iraq on a basis that was obviously fraudulent and has been proved now? As he is President of the EU, does the Taoiseach delude himself that he is doing it on behalf of a majority of the citizens of the EU who also massively opposed his bloody invasion? We know the Taoiseach has been a willing tool for US imperial ambitions. He allowed President Bush use our island home as an aircraft carrier for his bloody invasion of Iraq and he proposes to allow him use it again as a platform for his re-election campaign next autumn. No doubt President Bush&rsquo;s publicists are already working out the soft focus images of the mists blowing in to Sliabh Mish or the waves breaking on the Cliffs of Moher to push for a few nights off the American TV networks, the awful images of the killing fields in Iraq, for which he is responsible.</P>
      <P>What right has the Taoiseach to demand that the Irish people do not protest in large numbers against this cynicism? Is the Taoiseach a part of the disgusting and sinister move by Dublin City Council, backed by Fianna F&aacute;il councillors, to ban the Irish anti-war movement from legally placing posters on lampposts to notify people of legitimate and peaceful protests, as was done last February when 100,000 people came out in opposition to his policy?</P>
      <P>At what location does the Taoiseach intend to meet President Bush? Will he invite him to the D&aacute;il where we can plan an appropriate reception for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-US summit is taking place in Ireland in June. This has already been confirmed and the President of the United States is travelling to Ireland to participate in that summit where we will discuss EU-US summit issues, particularly the transatlantic relationships and improving transatlantic relationships. The agenda is not finalised but a recent parliamentary question gave a number of issues in which we will <Col N="1190"/>be involved. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, set this out and they have been well reported.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s position on Iraq has consistently been that we support Iraq with the transfer of power as soon as possible to a democratically-elected Iraqi Government. We recognise, as does Kofi Annan, that elections cannot be organised in the present circumstances. We received the United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s report on the recent electoral commission in Iraq late yesterday and we are broadly supportive of its conclusions and recommendations. The Secretary General said that consensus among the constituents is the best guarantee of a legitimate and credible transitional Government in Iraq. Our position on Iraq remains one of support for the role of the UN as it has been throughout and will continue to be.</P>

Peig was a noted teller of fairytales. This is an entirely appropriate location for the Taoiseach to meet the man who spun him what will become the most notorious fairytale of our epoch, except that the consequences were anything but fairytale.</P>
      <P>Muintir an Bhlascaoid knew a good fairytale when they heard one but, apparently, they were unlike the Taoiseach, who continues to be mesmerised by the tall tales coming out of Washington. Will the Taoiseach continue to be mesmerised by Messrs. Bush and Rumsfeld, who might as well have been the fiddlers of Dooney so compulsively has the Taoiseach continued to dance to their tune? He gave them our airports, <Col N="1191"/>diplomatic cover and anything they wanted. Now, he intends to do another jig for them, to help the President back into the White House again. If the Taoiseach does not withdraw this invitation, will he affirm the democratic right of the people to protest against it and to advertise that protest?</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was with deep regret that Members learned over the weekend of the death of Mr. Tom Leonard, a former member of the House and former constituency colleague of mine. May he rest in peace. Tom Leonard was a decent, honest, hard-working and quiet person of Irish politics. Born almost 80 years ago, he was <Col N="1192"/>educated at St. Mary&rsquo;s Christian Brothers&rsquo; school. He was a member and long-time servant of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute. He served in this House from 1977 to 1981 and won the by-election following the death of the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. George Colley, in 1983. He was a member of Dublin City Council for close on 30 years, in service to the people.</P>
      <P>The Leonard family have been prominent traders in the fruit and vegetable business in the markets area of Dublin for many decades, an association which continues to this day. Tom Leonard shared that close association with the area throughout his career and lived in the area for much of his life. He continued to work there after moving from the area and continued to spend much of his social, personal and family time in that area during his retirement.</P>
      <P>He was a quiet man but provided a good and efficient service. He was a champion of his local community and kept to the markets area, his constituency base, for most of his political life. The historic revitalisation of the area in recent years was a source of great pride to him as he spent much of his political life fighting for it. It did not come about during his political life but, in his retirement, he saw the rejuvenation of much of the area which came under the Dublin Corporation HARP project. In leaner times, when the people of the markets area had few resources, Tom Leonard and his family were very helpful to the poor of the area through their business, and stories are told of this in the area to this day.</P>
      <P>Tom Leonard remained fully involved in Fianna F&aacute;il up to his death. He was honorary president of my constituency association and was active in the local community of Castleknock where he lived during his retirement. He was a deeply religious man and was involved in many organisations connected with the church which helped the poor. He was very proud of that work but carried it out quietly and never discussed it.</P>
      <P>On my behalf and that of the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and all its members in my constituency of Dublin Central, I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Carmel, his children, Dominic, Dorothy, Mary-Louise and Alison, his four grandchildren and two surviving sisters.

I remember Tom Leonard as a very kind and gentle Deputy, well liked on all sides of the House. In many ways, he was the quintessential Dubliner who served his native city for a number of years as an alderman on Dublin City Council. I also recall the very close involvement of Tom and his family in the fruit and vegetable trade, and the great affection and esteem in which he was held by those involved in the Dublin markets.</P><Col N="1193"/>

I also extend, on behalf of my party, our sincere condolences to Tom&rsquo;s widow, Carmel, his son, Dominic, and daughters Dorothy, Mary-Louise and Alison. In the uncertain and cynical world of politics, it can be said that Tom Leonard was a truly decent man. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer my questions about the proposals the Minister for Finance pledged to bring forward to control the costs of tribunals of inquiry. Will those proposals involve legislation? Can the Taoiseach say when they will be brought forward? This is the same combination of parties which gave an additional &euro;800 per day to the lawyers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When in front of the party faithful they profess to wanting to control the costs. Is there legislation or is this more old blather from the Minister for Finance? I believe it is.</P>
      <P>Has the Cabinet agreed to the Bill to permit the implementation of electronic voting? If so, when is it likely to be introduced to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just answered the second question.</P>
      <P>The Bill dealing with the new format for inquiries is before the House and has reached Committee Stage. The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s view is that when that Bill has passed we should have a new arrangement for financing and we should not continue with the present scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That Bill has nothing to do with this. It was debated here last Friday when the Minister was on his way out to City West. What kind of misleading of the people is being engaged in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had that Bill before the House. He published it nine months ago. It is before the House. What was being referred to? <Col N="1197"/>The Minister for Finance said he inherited these tribunals, which is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I may very well be but the Minister said he was bringing forward proposals to control costs. Is there any basis for that? Is it permissable that the Minister should conduct himself in this fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to be out of order. I ask Deputy Rabbitte to resume his seat. We want some order on the Order of Business. The Deputy asked his question and he got his answer. The Chair is not responsible for the answer. Allow Deputy Sargent to ask a question.</P>

	<P>Legislation has been promised which may, I hope, save many jobs in the wind energy sector which are threatened by the EirGrid decision not to allow any further wind energy on to the electricity grid.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The energy Bill is to amend the powers of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, regulate assets not owned by the ESB, facilitate the development of an east-west Ireland-Wales electricity interconnector, increase the borrowing limits of the ESB and give the Minister power to give general directions to the CER.

	<P>The Taoiseach will be aware of the difficulties schools are having getting Garda vetting for personnel such as caretakers and special needs assistants. The interdepartmental group was due to report on the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children Bill. This matter cannot be let go on any longer given the seriousness of the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children Bill be published and brought before the House? There are lessons which have been learned in Britain that we do not want to learn here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important matter. The cross-departmental working group has been working on this for some time to put forward proposals for the reform of vetting of employees by the Garda.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am sympathetic to the concerns about accountability outlined by Deputy Deasy, I am nonetheless reluctant to make specific provision in the legislation for the provision of information to the Minister for the specific purpose of replying to parliamentary questions. Section 16 provides that the authority should give the Minister such information regarding its performance as he or she might require and I am satisfied that is sufficient. It would not be appropriate for the Minister to be answerable to the House for every decision taken by the authority not to grant or renew a licence.</P>
      <P>The Bill will establish an independent appeals board to which the authority&rsquo;s decision may be appealed and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law is also foreseen in section 40. However, I have explained as best I can that I sympathise with the issue raised by the Deputy in the context of other Bills as well as this. I am mindful, in rejecting the amendment that, in respect of the non-independent functions of the <Col N="1205"/>authority, the Minister of the day should be fully accountable to the House for the manner in which it discharges its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason the amendment was tabled was, each time the Legislature establishes an authority or a board, it devolves power to other bodies that are largely unaccountable. Accountability must be preserved and bodies that are created must be answerable to the House. I accept the Minister is precluded in certain circumstances from replying to parliamentary questions on the non-independent functions of these bodies but this is also an issue for the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The House is repeatedly creating bodies and a number of Ministers use them as an excuse not to reply to parliamentary questions by saying boards and authorities do not come under their remit. The Ceann Comhairle should draft a protocol for replying to these questions because the current position is vague. The Minister referred to section 16 but that could be read any way and it could mean anything. It is at the discretion of the Minister or Department concerned. A protocol must be introduced because the Chamber is becoming weakened and powerless in certain circumstances when Members table genuine parliamentary questions. The Ceann Comhairle has a role in this regard in terms of introducing a protocol that defines, once and for all, what questions can be answered when power is devolved from the House to an authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Deputy Deasy. The Minister acknowledged the importance of the amendment, even though he cannot accept it. He can, under this section, demand from the authority all the information he wants in terms of its performance but he can deny it to the House in reply to parliamentary questions on the ground that it might relate to its independent functions. The Minister can intervene fully in the authority&rsquo;s independence but the House is not prepared to do so. No conditions or restrictions are provided in the section regarding what the Minister can do but he can come up with a reason to deny the provision of reasonable information in reply to parliamentary questions. Such a requirement should be placed on the authority and it would be worthwhile to provide for that under the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 18, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) The following is inserted in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997:</P>
      <P LI="3"><Miles com="cp" par="80"/>Private Security Services Act 2004.     
      Section 18.</P><Miles com="cp" par="100"/><P Just="Right">&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I wish to ensure the ban on providing information will not interfere with the disclosure of documents 
under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The amendment seeks to insert a provision to ensure there would be access to information under the freedom of information legislation. In many ways this is in tandem with Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s amendment. If Members and the public are to access information, mechanisms in the legislation should enable this. It is crazy the way we conduct business in relation to the freedom of information legislation &mdash; we have to include a specific section determining the legislation, whereas we should have an enabling principle that all legislation that comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, unless specifically exempted. We have the cart before the horse. I suggest that it should be done in that way which would be in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. A great deal of business would be avoided if the maximum level of information was made available to Members and the public. Each time a Bill comes before the House, we have to specify that it is subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1997. It should happen automatically, unless stated otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If it were suggested that there should be a general amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to the effect that all bodies should be covered unless exempted by <Col N="1207"/>specific legislative enactment or statutory decision made by the Minister, that would be one thing but I am not the Minister in charge of that legislation and cannot pretend that I am. There is a well established and widely understood procedure for designating bodies such as this authority, when it is established for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which involves the making of regulations by the Minister for Finance, not me. A decision on the application of this Bill will be taken in accordance with normal procedures and I see no reason to depart from present procedures in this case. It will be for the Minister for Finance to decide, having consulted presumably with my Department as to whether the Bill should apply to the authority.</P>
      <P>The data in possession of the authority will include data on convictions, character, proceedings pending &mdash; supplied by applicants for licences or licensees. Sensitive information will be given to the authority supplied by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other authorities in another member state on criminal convictions, character and alleged criminal links. There will also be sensitive information which may have a bearing on State security such as possible paramilitary involvement in the private security industry. It is not as if this is an automatic candidate for complete application of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. One will have to consider carefully if the Act is to apply to the authority, to what extent it should apply and what material should be exempt from it.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind what the Deputy has said, whatever view one takes on the presumption that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 should apply, in this case, I am faced with the situation that it does not apply unless it is applied by a statutory instrument. If it is applied, by reference to a statutory instrument, it will have to take into account that some of the material in the possession of the private security authority almost certainly will not be put in the public domain. Whatever view one takes of the Deputy&rsquo;s argument for a presumption in favour of Freedom of Information Act applicability, in this case, a carefully tailored decision will have to be made exempting what is coverable and what ought not to be. It is not a defensive position that I am taking but I can see that if it is applied by the Minister for Finance, I will be asking him to exempt certain categories of information. That should be done in the ordinary course rather than by way of a blanket decision taken blindly without clear regard to many of the private and personal interests that will be at stake, not to mention the public interest also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct me if I am wrong but the motions stating which legislation will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 do not state the categories. Provision is made in the Act to deal with sensitive items and security matters <Col N="1208"/>to be withheld. That mechanism is already in place. To finecomb all legislation to see what should be subject to the Act is not the way to proceed either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>For instance, if the Deputy was to object on certain grounds to a security firm or an individual being granted a licence, quite clearly if that objection was to be referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for validation or additional information, it would frustrate the whole operation of his objection if information from the garda supplying the information and the decision taken thereafter was flung out into the public domain to be examined by anyone interested in the matter. If a person is refused a licence under this legislation, and the reasons and basis for that decision are made available in public, it will inhibit proper decision-making in what is a very sensitive area. Without saying that these decisions should be done in total secrecy and without redress and the capacity for somebody adversely affected to seek redress from the courts, I strongly suggest to the Deputy that it would be more desirable that the freedom of information legislation should be applied by regulation and subject to such exemptions as are necessary rather than on a blanket basis and that I would have to retrieve from the wreckage such exceptions as I think are appropriate.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 19, line 26, after &ldquo;character&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, financial position&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The intention behind these amendments is to give the authority power to demand additional information on the applicant&rsquo;s financial position when dealing with his or her application for a licence. Provision is already made for the authority to demand such information on an applicant&rsquo;s character and competence. It is envisaged that additional information on an applicant&rsquo;s financial position might, for example, be required where an applicant is a company applying for a private security employer&rsquo;s licence but the company is known or suspected to have financial problems. It is unlikely that the authority would need to use this provision in relation to an individual seeking a licence.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 19, line 29, to delete &ldquo;affidavit&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;statutory declaration&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1209"/>
      <P FLI="0">This is a drafting amendment in which I am seeking to change the wording. It would be more appropriate for what is required in sworn evidence to be given as a &ldquo;statutory declaration&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;affidavit&rdquo;. That would be more proper language in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Costello&rsquo;s amendment seeks to replace the word &ldquo;affidavit&rdquo; with &ldquo;statutory declaration&rdquo;. I remind the Deputy that the term used in the Bill is &ldquo;by affidavit or otherwise&rdquo;. This wording permits the authority to verify information by affidavit or, where it considers it appropriate, by means of a statutory declaration. An affidavit is sworn in law and must be confined to such fact as the deponent is capable of his or her knowledge to prove and the means of such knowledge. A statutory declaration under the Statutory Declaration Act 1938 is a written statement of facts which the declarer signs and solemnly declares conscientiously, believing it to be true.</P>
      <P>On the question of means of knowledge, an affidavit is slightly more restrictive. The result of leaving the Bill as it is will be that the authority will be able to demand affidavit evidence, which is a higher standard of proof, if and when it is appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 19, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) When deciding whether to grant a licence the Authority shall take into account any information supplied to it under<i> sections 21, 33 </i>and <i>35</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Section 22 deals with the granting or refusal of a licence by the authority. Amendment No. 36 makes explicit what is already implicit in the Bill. In deciding whether to grant a licence the authority shall have regard to the information supplied by the applicant when applying for the licence under section 21, including any supplementary information sought by the <Col N="1210"/>authority on an applicant&rsquo;s character or financial position or competence. It shall also have regard to information provided by the Garda under section 33 on foot of a request by the authority. The authority will also consider offences notified by the applicant to the authority under section 35.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s amendment No. 37 raises the interesting issue of the eligibility of persons convicted of serious crimes for a licence. The 1997 consultative group recommended that an application to hold a licence should be refused outright by the proposed authority if the applicant had ever been convicted of a range of serious offences, including murder, rape, sexual assault, armed robbery, drug trafficking or any offence carrying a sentence of more than ten years in prison. The group recommended a ten-year gap between the granting of a licence to persons convicted of a range of other offences. The Bill does not incorporate the detailed and prescriptive approach recommended by the consultative group. Instead, it requires the authority to consider each application on its merits.</P>
      <P>As I have stated, section 35 provides that an applicant for a licence, or any licensee seeking a renewal, who has been convicted of an offence or against whom proceedings for an offence are pending, must notify the authority of the conviction or the proceedings in a prescribed manner. For its part, the authority may, having considered the applicant&rsquo;s character and competence, grant or refuse a licence if it considers that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service. In arriving at its decision, the authority may require verification of information provided by the applicant by affidavit or may require the applicant to supply a certificate provided by a member of the Garda not below the rank of superintendent. Furthermore, the authority may request the Garda Commissioner to provide any information for the due performance of its functions in respect of any applicant for a licence or licensee.</P>
      <P>The authority will seek to strike an appropriate balance by operating the licensing system in the public interest and in the best interests of the private security industry itself while recognising an individual&rsquo;s right to earn a living and support himself or herself or provide for dependants. It is relevant in this context that the membership of the authority will include a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years&rsquo; standing and a representative of the Garda not below the rank of assistant commissioner.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 37 not moved.</P><Col N="1211"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(iii) that the employees of the body are not employed in a manner which complies with relevant employment legislation,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I propose that in granting a licence cognisance is taken of whether employees of a body are employed in a manner which complies with relevant employment legislation. This is one of the key issues in the context of the private security services industry. People work very long hours for poor wages, both of which are very much tied together. According to a directive of the EU which is now the law of the land, there is a maximum working week of 48 hours. The industry completely abuses the provision. I would like to know how the Minister proposes to ensure that the directive is complied with. The best way is to ensure that the legislation incorporates the relevant provisions.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the minimum wage. There are many involved in an industry which has not been regulated and we have seen evidence in committee of a great many cowboy operators. Many non-nationals have been employed as have people of rather murky character, and many of the latter have held licences. Companies have seemed to disappear overnight and nobody could find out where 20% of companies which had operated had gone from one year to the next.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure that dealings with employees are properly organised and that existing legislative provisions are adhered to. Minimum wages, at least, must be paid and the maximum working week must be enforced. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While there are very few criminal offences relating to an employer&rsquo;s liability arising from the relationship with an employee, a very obvious one involves failure to pay at least the minimum wage. Any case involving such an alleged offence would involve a great deal of argument about what was &ldquo;on time&rdquo; and what was &ldquo;off time&rdquo;. Where such a criminal offence was established, it would be a matter to be taken into account by the authority.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment in the context of the civil law objectives of compliance with equality law etc. If a person objected to the authority that an employer was in breach of the civil provisions of the Employment Equality Act, should the authority conduct its own separate investigation or rely on what it is told by others? That is the crucial question. If it is not to rely on its own judgment, should there be a certification mechanism to allow other bodies to indicate whether an employer was compliant with equality or tax law? While such a provision is laudable in principle, it would permit the authority when <Col N="1212"/>making a decision to be put in a legal minefield. Having been established to decide issues under the Act, it might be dragged into determining discrimination issues involving, for example, female employees with which it is not equipped to deal.</P>
      <P>It is not a function of the Health and Safety Authority to issue certificates of compliance with health and safety legislation. In those circumstances, how could the private security authority satisfy itself that health and safety legislation is being complied with in a particular case? Many private security employees work in the premises of the company&rsquo;s clients rather than in those of the employing company. If employees were asked to work in dangerous or defective premises, should the authority refuse to give a licence to the company on the grounds that it proposed to send its workers into such premises?</P>
      <P>The authority will be able to insist on submission of a tax clearance certificate as the collector general issues such certificates. There is no equivalent mechanism on compliance with the broad generality of employment and employee safety legislation. Amendment No. 40 proposes a mechanism that will help to ensure that only bona fide companies will apply to the new authority for licences.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the gravamen of Deputy Costello&rsquo;s amendment. However, if this authority is to function it cannot get mired in arguments about other statutory codes. It is not in a position to inquire into or summon evidence before it to decide the rights and wrongs of the issue, or come to binding conclusions about whether the law means A or B in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the complexity of covering the issue adequately. Section 22 states that a licence shall be refused if the applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service. I presume this requires a subjective opinion by the authority. It could look at a broad range of issues that might come to, or be brought to, its attention. In amendment No. 42, the Minister seems to spoil his argument about not getting involved in statutory codes. It states the authority shall &ldquo;refuse to renew a licence, or at any time suspend a licence for a specified period or revoke it, if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the safety or welfare of any person or persons is or may be at risk&rdquo;. It seems that the Minister is requiring the authority to uphold the health and safety code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The authority would have to be satisfied by this and not simply have the issue brought to its attention. I do not want it to turn itself into a health and safety authority mark two.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose a proposed employer or licensee was not a fit and proper person. I can envisage two outcomes. The first is where it is arguable on the employment record of a company that it was discriminatory by failing to take on three people of a certain nationality or ethnic <Col N="1213"/>origin and had taken on three successive people. Determining whether or not discrimination exists is a matter for another tribunal. A competent authority well versed in this law must strike a delicate balance.</P>
      <P>If Bloggs security limited said it would have no black employees, the authority could say that it is not a fit and proper person. I do not want to reduce the authority to making decisions that the law has already entrusted to other competent tribunals. This authority is primarily designed to run the security industry. The phrase &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; could exclude someone who is manifestly and unarguably in breach of civil law and the authority may take this into account. I do not want the authority to have to deal with arguments about every employment statute from health and safety to equality and non-discrimination when it considers licence applications. It simply could not do this. If the Equality Authority was to decide on a number of occasions that a particular security firm was manifestly in breach of its obligations, I am sure the &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; provision could cover this.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The effect of this amendment would be that all companies, whether unlimited or limited, would be covered by the requirement in the section to provide a copy of the certificate incorporation of the company when applying for a licence or renewal of licence.

    <P>Amendment to amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Concerns were expressed on Committee Stage about unscrupulous companies, possibly with dubious origins or connections, which are active in the private security area and flout employment law provisions. Concerns were also expressed about such companies disappearing and leaving debts only to reappear under a new guise. This new section seeks to address this problem by requiring companies applying for licences or renewal to supply a certificate of incorporation certified by the registrar of companies under the Companies Acts and dated not less than four weeks before the date of application. Under this, companies will not be able to take an off the shelf company from a solicitor and start off again.</P>
      <P>Second, if a person is carrying on a business under a name that is not the name of the beneficial owner of the business, a certified copy of the registration of the person under the Registration of Business Names Act must be submitted to the authority with the application for a licence or renewal. I am confident these provisions will help ensure that only bona fide companies and businesses are granted licences by the authority. Similar requirements were imposed on applicants for intoxicating liquor licences under section 38 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the provisions have operated as an effective deterrent to phoenix-type licences and applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendment. Is a sole trader covered by the requirement that a certificate of incorporation be provided? A sole trader is not a company, limited or otherwise. What is the legal status of this? Many structures that will come into existence will be neither limited nor unlimited companies.</P>
      
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, a sole trader who is self-employed is obliged under the registration of business names legislation to identify himself or herself as the proprietor. One cannot simply come up with a name and apply it to the business unless one identifies the beneficial owner.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to a body corporate, one must supply the certificate of incorporation. There is no middle ground between these two categories. Either a company is being carried on by a person or persons who are natural persons or, alternatively, it is being carried on by a person who is a legal person incorporated under statute. If it is the former, the registry of business names covers hiding behind any particular business description and, if it is the latter, one must supply a certificate of incorporation. I do not think there is a chink <Col N="1215"/>between these two floor boards between which anything will fall.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 22, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;to the licensee&rsquo;s knowledge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Section 25 deals with the authority&rsquo;s power to refuse or grant a renewal of a licence. One of the grounds for not renewing a licence is that false or misleading information was supplied with the original application for the licence, or with the application for renewal. However, the current text refers to the licensee supplying information that was to the licensee&rsquo;s knowledge false or misleading.</P>
      <P>I propose to delete the words &ldquo;to the licensee&rsquo;s knowledge&rdquo; because it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the authority to prove such knowledge, or lack of it in certain cases. There must be a clear onus on the applicant for a licence or for a renewal to ensure that any information supplied by him to the authority in connection with an application for a new licence or renewal is neither false nor misleading. If it emerges subsequently that false or misleading information was supplied, the authority may refuse to renew the licence or decide to revoke or suspend it for a specified period. In other words, if we simply say it is to the knowledge of the applicant false or misleading, we raise a presumption which the authority would have to overcome before it acted on the knowledge that the material supplied to it was false or misleading.</P>
      <P>If it has acted on false or misleading information, it appears that <i>prima facie</i> it should be entitled not to renew or to revoke, as the case may be, unless the applicant shows to the authority the reason it should not happen. If we went with the original proposal, which requires that the authority demonstrates guilty knowledge on the part of the applicant, it would let the air out of the authority&rsquo;s tyres and leave it stranded in dealing with the matter. Unless there is a compelling reason to believe something was done deliberately, falsehoods or misleading material would have to be ignored by it. That is not a good idea.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, I ask Deputy Costello to withdraw his suggestion that the word &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo; be added to section 45. If one says something that is false or misleading, the presumption is that the authority should be able to act on that fact once it is established, without <Col N="1216"/>trying to inquire into the psychology, motivation or moral character of the applicant in making such a false or misleading submission.</P>

      <P LI="3">(i) refuse to renew a licence, or at any time suspend a licence for a specified period or revoke it, if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the safety or welfare of any person or persons is or may be at risk from the continuance in force of the licence, and</P>
      <P LI="3">(ii) notify the licensee of its decision.</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>)<i> Section 26</i> does not apply in relation to a decision under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Concerns were expressed justifiably during earlier discussions about the behaviour and activities of certain persons engaged in private security activities, including certain door supervisors. A number of cases involving violence or assault have already come before the courts. I am satisfied that an emergency power to prohibit the provision of a security service is, therefore, justified in circumstances where the safety or welfare of the public may be at risk.</P>
      <P>I propose to insert a new subsection (2) in section 25, which will, in turn, replace the current provision in section 26(5) in order to give the authority the power to refuse to renew, suspend or revoke a licence if it is satisfied that the safety or welfare of any person may be at risk from its continuance in force. Where the authority invokes this power, the licensee may appeal to the appeal board in the ordinary way. However, because of the risk to the public, I propose that the licensee cannot continue to provide the security service pending the outcome of the appeal. In order to ensure equal treatment between licensees and relevant persons, who are persons holding a licence from a comparable authority in other EU member states, I also propose appropriate amendments to the Third Schedule, which modifies the Bill in its application to such persons.</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to deal with what were legitimate concerns raised in regard to what can be done on a fire brigade basis to deal with people who are, on the face of it, a danger to the public in discharging their duties, without coming to a final conclusion as to whether they are guilty of a particular offence.</P>

      <P FLI="0">In a verbal amendment to amendment No. 66, I propose to update the reference to the new section, the collective citation of the Companies Acts, to take account of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, which was passed at the end of last year. The collective citation in subsection (3) of the new section should be amended to refer to the Companies Acts 1963 to 2003.</P>
      <P>In a verbal amendment to amendment No. 86 I propose to change the line references in the amendment to refer to lines 30 and 31 in page 46 instead of 32 and 33.

      <P FLI="0">Issues relating to the use of identify cards were discussed at some length in the select committee. I propose a number of changes to strengthen existing provisions. For reasons of clarity, I propose a new text to section 28, which incorporates these changes rather than presenting the changes separately. The changes I propose are as follows. First, the existing provisions whereby a person is given ten days to produce an identity card in a Garda station is being dropped. Second, the penalty for using the identity card of another person is being increased to &euro;3,000, or 12 months imprisonment, or both. The same penalty will apply to a new offence of forging or altering a card using such a forged or altered card. Third, the Garda power of arrest will be extended to cases where a garda, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person providing a security card is using an identity card issued to another person or a forged or altered card. These changes respond to the concerns which were raised on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s proposal in amendment No. 45 that identity cards be worn by licensees, provision has already been made in section 29 for an alternative, that is, the wearing of identity badges by prescribed categories of licensees which will carry the licence number&rsquo;s holder. I recently had some difficulty at a meeting in University College, Dublin, from which I had to fight my way out in the company of members of the Garda. A number of people present at the meeting with personal experience of the security industry were strongly of the view that they should wear some form of identification on them but should not be subjected to having their name and address blazoned across their chests. They believed that this could be used to intimidate them. That is why it is required to wear a card with a licence number and possess an identity card. More information will be contained on the former with a view to safeguarding employees from unlawful threats and intimidation. At the same time, it ensures that a garda who happens on a scene will be in position to see that not only is the person wearing the requisite external authorisation, but also carrying an internal security counter check and that they are the person to whom the authorisation relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying that an individual licensee would have a card that is not <Col N="1220"/>publicly visible. However, my amendment proposes that any identity cards should be visible to the members of the public. I do not necessarily want names and addresses on the cards. However, members of the public should be able to view an identification card number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Deasy provided a security service outside a venue, he would be required to have a badge which would have his license number on it. However, it would not identify him or his home address. It would be sufficient for a person to know that he was number 1,308 and make a complaint about him. If a garda comes on the scene, he can ask Deputy Deasy not only to show him what is on his uniform, but also to prove who he is and that there is a correspondence between what is worn and his private identity. All the advice available to me from the security industry states that this is the appropriate way for this measure to work.</P>
      <P>Garda&iacute; are obliged to have a number on their epaulettes, such as F108. However, they are not required to put their names and addresses on their uniform lapels. This amendment is to bring about the equivalence of certainty. With regard to the Garda, one knows that no two members will have the number F108. However, this amendment will enable garda&iacute; to establish the identity of the person they are dealing with and ensure that whatever badge is worn corresponds to the individual identity.</P>
      <P>An alternative system would be to require all security people to have clear identification on their uniforms showing that they were not merely licensed but also who they were by way of name and address. The advice available to me is that this would expose them to unwarranted threats and interventions, such as their homes or families being threatened. A balance has been struck so that they must carry the relevant material on them while they can be publicly identified by their licence number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying that all people across all categories will carry whatever is required to establish their identification on them. Will there be a format put in place or is this a matter for the authority to determine? I understand only prescribed categories will have badges affixed. Will these be prescribed by the authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>For the record, I wish to make clear that the form of both categories will be prescribed by the authority. If one was doing private surveillance, such as a store detective, displaying a big badge on one&rsquo;s lapel would make such an exercise redundant. Store detectives in large firms might not be required to carry a badge on their breast pocket. However, they would be required to be in possession of a card. On the other hand, a bouncer at a pub would be required to carry a badge and a card. A security man in uniform at a factory would also be required to <Col N="1221"/>carry the badge and the card. That is a common sense distinction between the two categories. If it was not made, it would make a nonsense of the legislation. It will be made in statutory form.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the register of licensees and proposes that it should be published on the Internet. Section 32(3) states: &ldquo;The Register shall be kept at the offices of the Authority and be made available for inspection by any person free of charge during office hours.&rdquo; It is not intended that the register should be in any way a security document that could not be made available. It would be appropriate for the list of all in the private security services business who are registered with the authority to be as accessible to the public as possible, and the Internet would be the obvious mechanism for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some sympathy with this amendment. I am not against the principle of it, but it is unnecessary, because the Electronic Commerce Act 2000 already provides that, if a public body &ldquo;is required ... or permitted to give information in writing,&rdquo; the body concerned &ldquo;may give the information in electronic form&rdquo;. However, in this context, the safety of private security personnel and their families must also be taken into account in making the register available. Although it would be reasonable to have the names and addresses of approved security equipment companies on a website, to publicise the names of security guards who might be involved in cash and transit operations or transporting valuable consignments could put the guards&rsquo; safety and that of their families at risk.</P>
      <P>At present, the Bill provides for a register that anyone can consult. That allows somebody to have an eye to whether and why an individual is consulting the register, but if the information was simply available on the Internet and nobody knew who was consulting the register or why they were consulting it, that would raise the odds that somebody would do it for a malign purpose and in complete privacy. The matter should be left to the authority to decide. If it wanted to put the names of companies that supply security services on the Internet, that would be one thing, but if it wanted to put up the names of private individuals who engage in cash and transit protection services that would be another. It is better to have a more flexible approach rather than to require everything to be placed on the Internet and consulted by malign people without our having any possibility of knowing who was scrutinising the register and why. The authority would not refuse to put on the Internet material that should <Col N="1223"/>be publicly available without any limitation, but there is a balance to be struck on material that should be made public but should be kept in a form that means that whoever consults it would be known to the registrar and subject to scrutiny. In view of this, I prefer not to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>As there would therefore be no way of knowing, the information might as well be on the Internet. Anybody can inspect it and is entitled to do so free of charge.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, section 32(4) states: &ldquo;A copy of an entry in the Register shall, on request, be issued by the Authority on payment of such fee ... as may be prescribed.&rdquo; It would be available for nothing if it was on the Internet, but under this provision, people will have to go to the authority&rsquo;s offices and pay a fee if they want copies. I would like the Bill to include a provision to the effect that the register should be freely available. The obvious place to publish it would be the Internet unless there was any specific reason for not including every licensee. If every licensee is dealt with properly and is above board, that should not be a problem.</P>

	<P>It is a matter of judgment, not a matter of high principle, as far as I am concerned. For instance, the name and address of every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not available on the Internet. Nor is the name and address of every member of the Defence Forces. In certain circumstances, it is possible for a person to ascertain the identity of an individual garda who they allege assaulted him or her by reference to the garda&rsquo;s shoulder numbers. However, it would not be a good idea to put every guard&rsquo;s address on the Internet in the interests of general openness, transparency and accountability I agree with Deputy Costello on companies that are registered with the authority. There should be no problem with that, but to put the names of individuals on the Internet so that people can consult those names at their leisure would probably achieve few positive results and could achieve significant negative ones. In view of this, I ask Deputy Costello to withdraw the amendment.</P>

The new subsection that I propose in amendment No. 53 introduces a defence for a person who has contravened that provision and is being prosecuted. The defence is that the individual or company who is providing the security service produced an identity card or licence. That is a reasonable provision to protect a private individual, such as a person who is having an alarm installed in a domestic dwelling and who may have inadvertently employed an unlicensed individual or company despite having sought production of an identity card or licence and having had a licence or card produced to him or her. It is a defence for the innocent purchaser or requisitioner of services.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;that the complainant has a personal interest in the subject matter of the complaint&rdquo;. It is difficult to argue the case for them. It is exceedingly hard to demonstrate that there is a personal interest in a complaint and it is required that there be a personal interest for a complaint to be lodged. The Bill seems to be contradictory: to act, the authority must be satisfied that the complainant has a personal interest and that the complaint is made in good faith. I would have thought that &ldquo;that the complaint is made in good faith&rdquo; would be sufficient. The requirement for a personal interest seems to be at least tautologous as well as undesirable.</P>

      <P>The authority may form an opinion on foot of a complaint that an emergency response is called for. This is now being provided for. The authority may revoke or suspend the licence and the licensee will not be allowed to continue to provide the security service concerned until an appeal against its decision has been completed. Therefore, a person against whom a strong <i>prima facie</i> case has been made that he or she should not be allowed to provide a security service will face having his or her status frozen and his or her licence effectively suspended until a considered decision has been made, on appeal, in the other direction.

	<P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 29, to delete lines 12 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;40.&mdash;(1) Within 3 months after the date on which an appeal is determined by the Appeal Board any party to the appeal may <Col N="1227"/>appeal to the High Court on any question of law arising from the determination.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">During Committee Stage discussions of the appeal arrangements set out in the Bill it was pointed out with some degree of force that while Schedule 2 provided that the authority would be a party to an appeal to the appeal board, no such provision had been made for licensees in cases in which the appeal was being taken by a complainant whose complaint against the licensee had not been upheld by the authority. A similar problem was encountered in the matter of appeals to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
      <P>Having considered the issues raised at that session, I am now proposing the following amendments: first, the right of an appeal to the High Court on a point of law is extended to any party to the appeal; second, a new subparagraph 14.7, providing that the appeal board shall serve notice of its decision on each party to the appeal, is inserted in Schedule 2; third, a new paragraph 18 is inserted in Schedule 2, making specific provision for cases of complaint against licensees under section 38. It also applies the provisions of paragraph 17, which permits the authority to make submissions or observations on an appeal to the appeal board, to licensees and complainants. These changes are an adequate response to the concerns raised on Committee Stage and deal with the subject of Deputy Costello&rsquo;s two amendments to section 40 and Schedule 2.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 29, line 37, before &ldquo;is&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;proposes to provide or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">During the discussions on Committee Stage concerns were expressed by Deputies that persons who would not qualify for a licence here because of criminal convictions might be able to obtain by whatever means a licence from a corresponding authority in another member state. Such a circumvention of our standards and procedures would be a serious matter. If a person was knocked out of the process in Ireland and simply appealed to another authority in Europe, he or she might get back in by the back door.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring this does not happen, I propose to insert two new provisions in Part 6 of the Bill in the form of sections. The first provides that before providing a security service here a relevant person &mdash; that is, a person who holds a licence from a corresponding authority &mdash; must notify the authority of any criminal convictions or proceedings on their way and supply details of them. A person applying for a <Col N="1228"/>licence here on foot of an authorisation by a foreign state must provide the Irish authority with details of convictions or pending proceedings and the type of offences. The authority may then decide on the basis of that information that the relevant person is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service here and may prohibit that person from providing such a service or prohibit the provision of the service for a specified period. A relevant person who contravenes a prohibition decision will be guilty of an offence and subject to a penalty on conviction of a &euro;3,000 fine or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment or both.</P>
      <P>The second new section provides that the authority may at any time, if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a relevant person is not or no longer a fit and proper person to provide a security service in the State, prohibit the person from providing a security service or prohibit the provision of the service for a specified period. Amendment No. 63 provides that the authority shall inform the appropriate corresponding authority of any decision taken in respect of a relevant person.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Committee Stage amendment, the Department went into deep contemplation on this issue to come up with a solution compatible with European law while being workable. We did not want to create a law in Ireland which would encourage people to go abroad because they were ineligible in Ireland to a member state of the European Union which might not have the knowledge or the means to work out whether they would be suitable to provide this service in Ireland and might, therefore, inadvertently grant them an authorisation which would under European law entitle them to operate here.</P>
      <P>This is a defence against people circumventing our protections by engaging in offshore transactions to authorise them to provide services in Ireland. It is a sensible approach and one which will not inhibit freedom of establishment and freedom to trade under European Union law but will give the Irish authorities some protection against those who decide in bad faith to circumvent Irish law by duping a European member state authority into giving them an authorisation which they know would have been refused here.</P>

In essence, when the three spokespersons are here it is the same procedure being visited again but on the other hand, valuable work has been done between Committee and Report Stages.

      <P>Is iontach an smaoineamh &eacute; agus bh&iacute; &aacute;thas orm nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; mar Aire St&aacute;it sa Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oile&aacute;in go raibh s&eacute; dhe phribhl&eacute;id agam an ch&eacute;ad dheontas ariamh a thabhairt do Sheachtain na Gaeilge. C&eacute; go mbaineann an Ghaeilge leis an mbliain ioml&aacute;n, is smaoineamh maith &eacute; go mbeadh seachtain faoi leith ann gach bliain ina dtabharfa&iacute; aird faoi leith ar an dteanga. Ar nd&oacute;igh is tr&aacute;thi&uacute;il an rud &eacute; go mb&iacute;onn an tseachtain sin ann thart ar L&aacute;&rsquo; le P&aacute;draig.</P>
      <P>D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh daoine a r&aacute; gur iarsma den stair &iacute; an Ghaeilge agus nach bhfuil luach ar bith l&eacute;i sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann. N&iacute; chreidim &eacute; seo. T&aacute; tuiscint n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; ariamh ann anois ar th&aacute;bhacht an cult&uacute;ir agus na hoidhreachta le socha&iacute; ioml&aacute;n s&aacute;s&uacute;il a choth&uacute;. T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht le ruda&iacute; &aacute;bhartha ach t&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht ag pobail le luachanna agus le hoidhreacht a cheangla&iacute;onn le ch&eacute;ile iad. T&aacute; rud &eacute;igin l&aacute;idir sa duine daonna a shanta&iacute;onn an moth&uacute; gur cuid de phobal &eacute;, n&iacute; amhain pobal at&aacute; ann anois ach pobal a bh&iacute; ann agus a bheidh ann.

      <P>Ar fud an domhain tuigimid anois an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le caomhn&uacute; na hoidhreachta fisici&uacute;il agus na hoidhreachta cult&uacute;ra.

N&iacute;l stair chomh fada sin ag TG4 ach n&iacute;l aon amhras faoi ach go bhfuil lucht f&eacute;ach&aacute;na nua ar fad faighte go lean&uacute;nach ag TG4 do chl&aacute;racha Gaeilge. T&aacute; TG4 thar a bheith ceangailte leis an saol nua. Smaoin&iacute;mid ar chl&aacute;racha ar n&oacute;s Ros na R&uacute;n agus na cl&aacute;racha sp&oacute;irt. Is aisteach le r&aacute; &eacute; gurb &eacute; an chl&aacute;r is m&oacute; go mb&iacute;onn lucht feach&aacute;na aige ag TG4 chuile bhliain na Cluiche Ceannais Peile na mB&aacute;n.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Historians, when they come to write the authoritative history of independent Ireland in the 20th century, will highlight two key dates as having a special significance: 24 December 1955, when Ireland joined the United Nations and 1 January 1973, when Ireland joined the European Economic Community. When Ireland joined the United Nations we entered into an important international agreement, under the terms that are stipulated in Article IV, Chapter 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, which states: &ldquo;Membership in the United Nations is open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations of the Charter and, in the judgement of the organisation, are willing and able to carry out these obligations.&rdquo; In this way, Ireland aligned itself with the peaceful nations of the world and recognised we have responsibilities that extend beyond our geographical borders. In matters of international peace and security, Ireland gladly accepted the role that comes with full and active participation within the United Nations. Importantly, this act seemed to signal an end to the policies of isolation that preceded it. Irish neutrality in the Second World War was not then, and should not be seen now, as a matter for national pride. Ireland has never fully confronted the significant moral questions that arise from our inaction in the face of the unspeakable evil that swept Europe in the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
       <P>No country can exist and no society can live in splendid isolation from everyone else. The interdependence of the modern world, and our growing connectivity in terms of language, culture, trade and common experience, has helped Ireland to realise that we have an <Col N="1241"/>important role to play on the international stage, at European and United Nations level. When Ireland took the historic step of becoming a member of the European Economic Community in 1973, it was another significant milestone. In the same way that Ireland had recognised our place within the United Nations, we now forged an alliance with our European neighbours that was to shape our future. Through membership of the United Nations and the EEC, Ireland took a place on the world stage. Ireland realised that we have responsibilities to other states and peoples, and that separation from our neighbours was not an option.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In joining the United Nations, Ireland undertook to assist the work of the UN in every possible way. The Irish Defence Forces have continued to meet this undertaking, and meet it courageously, without fail. Since 1958, the Defence Forces have had a continuous presence on peacekeeping missions, and from the Middle East to Central America this presence has been valued and respected. However, the manner in which a contingent of the Defence Forces may be deployed on service to the United Nations is of concern to Fine Gael. The participation of the Defence Forces is subject to what is commonly known as a triple lock, which in effect places an excessive restriction on Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions. It may even put them in line for more dangerous duties and out of consideration for less dangerous ones.</P>
      <P>Under the triple lock system, before a contingent of the Defence Forces may be deployed, three conditions must be satisfied: the action they are taking part in must be endorsed by a full United Nations mandate establishing or authorising such an international UN force; the deployment must be agreed within the Government itself; and the deployment must be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The triple lock system is too restrictive and needs to be reformed. It means that, although the Government has committed 850 troops to the EU Rapid Reaction Force, an EU capability designed to undertake humanitarian and crisis management tasks, these forces will only be deployed under the triple lock system. This means, for Ireland, that any potential military action must be endorsed by a full United Nations mandate establishing or authorising such an international UN force, approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and agreed within the Government.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s International Peace Missions Deployment Bill 2003, in my name and that of Deputy McGinley, aims to reform the outdated triple lock. By applying such a restrictive code upon the involvement of Irish forces in even European operations, the Government has ruled out Irish participation in certain peacekeeping activities that, while being in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the <Col N="1242"/>United Nations, may lack a specific UN resolution.</P>
      <P>Chapter VIII, Article 52, of the Charter of the United Nations sets out the position with regard to regional arrangements as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Bill will allow for continued participation in an international UN force and will also allow for participation in other peace missions that are in keeping with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Moreover, given the long and proud tradition of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping and peace enforcement activities internationally, reform of the triple lock system is especially critical. Without reform, the triple lock will continue to prohibit participation of the Defence Forces in certain peacekeeping activities.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the triple lock is excessively restrictive. For example, the Defence Forces could not take part in an EU peacekeeping force such as Operation Concordia, sent to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, even though this force replaced NATO forces in the region and had both UN and EU support, although not a formal UN resolution.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in getting a UN resolution establishing or authorising an international UN force can relate to the self-interests of members of the UN Security Council. The Security Council is made up of five permanent members and ten rotating members. It normally takes nine Security Council members to carry a resolution, so long as none of the permanent members &mdash; the US, Russia, China, the UK and France &mdash; vote against. In the case of Macedonia, however, such a resolution fell foul to the self-interests of one of the permanent members.</P>
      <P>The member that stood between Macedonia and a formal UN resolution was China. This resulted in the withdrawal of UNPREDEP, the UN Preventive Deployment Force in Macedonia, which was to be extended to the region. Macedonia had recognised Taiwan, so China retaliated by blocking the UN peacekeeping force resolution, a selfish act on the part of the Chinese Government. The only reason China could have had for voting against the resolution was to send a message across the globe, the message being: &ldquo;If you recognise Taiwan, we will thwart any resolutions of assistance to you at the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We can argue about the structures and decision-making processes at the United Nations another day. The simple fact is that Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces were grounded and prevented from going to the assistance of another country because of the petty approach adopted by China <Col N="1243"/>at the United Nations. By having an automatic triple lock we have given self-serving members of the UN Security Council which may be operating to a narrow national agenda the right to pre-empt our free decisions. This is neither healthy nor wise. If it is China today, it could be Russia, the United States, France or Britain some other day. That is not right. Importantly, it also takes from our right as a free Parliament to take sovereign and independent decisions as we see fit and in keeping with our beliefs.</P>
      <P>This triple lock is too restrictive and imposes a political straitjacket on Ireland&rsquo;s long tradition of peacekeeping. Although the Government has committed 850 troops to Liberia, Irish forces can only be deployed under a UN mandate. There can, therefore, be no European Rapid Reaction Force under Chapter 8. Party politics should not play a part in this, nor should the Government be cowed by fear of extremists. Fine Gael wants an end to the triple lock and a principled basis to be established on which deployment decisions are made.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have embarked on a challenging and dangerous mission to Liberia. There should be no prohibition on Defence Forces involvement in the ongoing action in Macedonia or, as is likely, a force that may be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near future. The Defence Forces should be allowed to act in both Macedonia and Bosnia Herzegovina, probable future member states of the European Union, but the triple lock straitjacket prevents us taking part.</P>
      <P>The International Peace Missions Deployment Bill 2003 is specifically drafted to recognise the primacy and importance of the United Nations and, within this country, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Even though Fine Gael seeks to remove the need for a specific UN resolution before a contingent of the Defence Forces can be dispatched, the Bill makes specific reference to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. For example, section 3 would amend the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act of 1960 to clearly state a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be dispatched for service outside the State as part of a particular international United Nations force or international peace mission if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was satisfied that the international peace mission accorded with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Bill goes on to state a resolution approving of the dispatch would also have to be passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>The purposes and principles of the United Nations are set forth in Articles I and II of the UN Charter. They are the overarching aims of the United Nations and the broad and noble aspirations that we, as a member of the United Nations, are pledged to uphold. The main purposes of the United Nations are to affirm the importance of international peace and security and, to that end, take effective collective <Col N="1244"/>measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace; to suppress acts of aggression; and to bring about, by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, settlements of international disputes. Furthermore, the United Nations exists to promote the need for the development of friendly relations among states based on respect for equal rights and the self-determination of peoples, and to achieve international co-operation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. In addition to these fundamental purposes, the principles of the United Nations include the affirmation of the sovereign equality of all members, the requirement that all members settle international disputes peacefully, and the obligation that members shall give the United Nations every assistance in its actions.</P>
      <P>I am proud that this Bill, brought forward by Fine Gael, recognises and upholds these purposes and principles. While it would allow for a contingent of the Defence Forces to be deployed without a specific United Nations resolution, it particularly denotes that any such action would have to be in keeping with the purposes and principles to which we, as a member of the United Nations, wholeheartedly subscribe.</P>
      <P>All too often when we talk about Irish security policy, opponents of greater engagement talk about the need to preserve Irish sovereignty. However, there is nothing sovereign about the current situation. The reality is that under the triple lock we abdicate our freedom to decide for ourselves and leave it in the hands of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Fine Gael wants to end this barrier to Ireland acting as an independent sovereign state. The purpose of the Bill is to end this restriction on our sovereignty. The Bill seeks to amend the Defence Acts to allow Ireland to send troops to participate in peace missions, once the D&aacute;il was satisfied that those missions were in keeping with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>Chapter 8, Article 52 of the UN Charter deals with regional arrangements. Section 3 of the Bill would allow the dispatch of Irish troops as part of an international peace mission if a UN resolution had been passed by the D&aacute;il and it was in keeping with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as set out in Chapter 8, Article 52. In other words, in peacekeeping and enforcement we would decide for ourselves what did and did not meet the UN Charter requirements and we would not in future be vetoed on this issue by Security Council members acting selfishly.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council is the authority under international law which can sanction action against aggressors under Chapter 7 of the Charter. Fine Gael did not support the recent war in Iraq because it did not have the sanction of proper authority in international law, that is, the Security Council. The triple lock did not prevent the use of Irish airspace and facilities by the <Col N="1245"/>United States. This is a separate issue and relates to the deployment of our own troops in peace missions as and when we decide.</P>
      <P>The D&aacute;il is the proper authority in constitutional law permitted to decide on the deployment of our troops in lawful peacekeeping or peace enforcement activities but it was sidelined on Macedonia by another state acting selfishly, although 13 other EU member states and 14 non-EU states participated. They were not sidelined in this manner. This is in keeping with the UN Charter which we consistently seek to uphold. Where the United Nations clearly supports the deployment of EU troops, as in Macedonia, it is nonsense that we cannot participate. Serving in Macedonia and, in the future, Bosnia-Herzegovina, would present less danger to Irish troops than the current deployment of Irish troops in Liberia.</P>
      <P>This ludicrous situation has been openly acknowledged by members of one of the Government parties, the Progressive Democrats, notably Senator Minihan on 30 March 2003 when he told the press that it was &ldquo;complete nonsense&rdquo; that Ireland had to decline to take part in the EU peacekeeping mission in Macedonia. Furthermore, he said: &ldquo;While we want the UN to be central to our foreign policy aims, our own law has left us in an absurd position in relation to peacekeeping in Europe.&rdquo; I share these views. What is important in all of these matters is that we take the decision, in our sovereign Parliament, based on the UN Charter, not the agenda requirements of one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>When I launched the Fine Gael policy document, Beyond Neutrality, last May, I undertook to bring forward a Bill that would correct the triple lock anomaly. The position of Fine Gael is amply illustrated within this document. It states: &ldquo;The &lsquo;triple lock&rsquo; system is ... a political straightjacket&rdquo;. The fact that there is no support from Ireland for the peacekeeping forces in Macedonia illustrates the need to revisit security and defence issues within an EU framework, in line with the commitments made in Beyond Neutrality, we have introduced this Bill.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a sovereign State and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is Ireland&rsquo;s independent Parliament. Neither China nor any other state should have a veto on whether we send our Defence Forces for service overseas. To allow this situation to continue into the future is to turn our backs on the important responsibilities that come with independence. Fine Gael will continue to raise the issue of defence and security in the hope that we can at last have a healthy debate on what are issues of major national importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of this Bill is a logical follow through on the policy document issued last May and of which my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, was the main architect. It is appropriate and opportune that the Bill is introduced in the D&aacute;il at this time.</P><Col N="1246"/>
      <P>The United Nations came into being on 24 October 1945 with Ireland becoming a member in 1955. Since its establishment, the United Nations has become synonymous with the application of a fair and just international law. Born of the dreadful conflict that was the Second World War, the name United Nations was first used in the Declaration by United Nations of 1 January 1942, when representatives of 26 nations pledged their governments would continue fighting together against an evil that threatened Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>When Ireland joined the United Nations, we undertook an onerous responsibility. Members of the United Nations do not simply sign on the dotted line. They undertake to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours; to unite to maintain international peace and security; to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest; and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.</P>
      <P>In addition, members of the United Nations pledge support for the UN through their armed forces when called upon by the UN for assistance. It is right and proper that we remind ourselves of the bravery and the selflessness of our Defence Forces when called to the service of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>A contingent of Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces is currently serving on one of its most challenging and dangerous missions in Liberia. The Minister has first-hand knowledge of, and information on, the conditions and dangerous situation in which they are operating in that country. These members of the Defence Forces are following in a long and proud tradition. Ireland has a long history of service under the flag of the United Nations and this must be a source of considerable pride to the Irish people. Since 1958, the Defence Forces have had a continuous presence on United Nations peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East. However, in recent years, Defence Forces&rsquo; personnel have also found themselves in many other parts of the globe as peacekeepers.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s first observer mission with the United Nations was in 1958, when a contingent of the Defence Forces travelled to the Lebanon. The first peacekeeping mission to which an armed Irish contingent was committed was to the Congo from 1960 to 1964. Indeed, an Irish officer, Lieutenant General Sean McKeown, was force commander in the Congo from January 1961 to March 1962. Over 6,000 Irishmen served on this mission, 26 of whom died while on service to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s role in the United Nations has continued to evolve. The first enforcement mission was to Somalia in 1993, and the Defence Forces are involved in an ongoing stabilisation force in former Yugoslavia, known as SFOR.</P><Col N="1247"/>
      <P>Defence Forces personnel have served as observers in central America, Russia, former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Namibia, Western Sahara, South Africa and East Timor. This displays clearly the Irish commitment to important peacekeeping work, a commitment that was strengthened in 1993 when the then Government restated the roles of the Defence Forces and defined one of them as being &ldquo;To participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace.&rdquo; This was further affirmed in the 1996 White Paper on Foreign Policy which states, &ldquo;Given the unique role and authority of the United Nations and the fact that its peacekeeping activities have proved an important element in containing conflict, the Government are committed to sustaining the overall level of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to peacekeeping.&rdquo; However, this contribution has had a high cost. In the cause of peace, 82 members of our Defence Forces have given their lives &mdash; a huge contribution and sacrifice from a small country.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have had a high degree of success in the troubled parts of the world where they have served. By definition, the role of the peacekeeper is a difficult one. Peacekeepers are sent to those areas where acts of violence are a daily occurrence and where local and international agreements are being breached. Those serving as peacekeepers are equipped with defensive weaponry, but can only use force in self-defence.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as a country without colonies, is free of the historical baggage that weighs heavily on other forces which may be called to assist in the world&rsquo;s trouble spots. The independence of those from Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces who serve with the United Nations is above question, and is apparent from the high level of success that they have achieved on many trips to the troubled regions of the world.</P>
      <P>The traditional type of peacekeeping missions in which the Defence Forces were involved from the late 1950s have become ever more diverse and onerous. Today, the Defence Forces on missions with the United Nations are involved in multifaceted operations, which include the investigation of human rights abuses; disarming and demobilising forces; monitoring elections; mine clearance; protection of humanitarian aid; establishment and protection of safe areas; assisting the civil administration; and dealing with other UN agencies and non-governmental organisations on an increasing basis.</P>
      <P>Despite the range of responsibilities that the Defence Forces may find on mission with the United Nations, the manner in which a contingent of the Defence Forces can be deployed for service abroad remains tied to an antiquated provision of existing legislation. The provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1960 mean that three criteria must be met before a contingent of the Defence <Col N="1248"/>Forces may be dispatched for service. Section 2 of the Act provides for the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces for service outside the State if such action is endorsed by a full United Nations mandate establishing or authorising such an international UN force; approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and agreed within the Government.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, this may seem like a reasonable set of provisions. The dispatch of any contingent of the Defence Forces is a serious matter requiring appropriate care and consideration. However, by applying such a restrictive code, usually referred to as the triple lock system, on the involvement of Irish forces in even European operations, the Government has also ruled out Irish participation in some peacekeeping activities.</P>
      <P>For example, Ireland could not participate in the EU peacekeeping force sent to Macedonia, a probable future member of the EU, even though this force replaced NATO and had both EU and UN support set out in resolution 1371. It now seems likely that EU troops will replace NATO in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself.</P>
      <P>Individual political positioning at the United Nations can affect whether the UN is able to reach a decision regarding a formal resolution endorsing a peacekeeping force. The self interests of members of the Security Council can play a negative role, as they did in the case of Macedonia. The Security Council is made up of five permanent members and ten rotating members. It normally takes nine Security Council members to carry a resolution, so long as none of the permanent members &mdash; the US, Russia, China, the UK and France &mdash; votes against. However, in the case of Macedonia, such a resolution was not carried because it did not suit the interests of China. Macedonia had recognised Taiwan, so China consequently retaliated by blocking the UN peacekeeping force resolution. Therefore, by having a triple-lock, we have given self-serving members of the UN Security Council, who may be operating to a narrow national agenda, the right to pre-empt our free decision. Obviously, this situation is neither healthy nor wise.</P>
      <P>Under the triple-lock system we abdicate our freedom to decide for ourselves and we leave it in the hands of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. There should not be a barrier to Ireland acting as an independent State. It is absurd that our sovereign decision can be manipulated by a world power, as happened in the case of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Developments at EU level have also thrown into focus the Defence Acts and the manner in which a contingent of the Defence Forces can be deployed. In 1999, EU leaders agreed to create a rapid reaction force to which Ireland committed troops but these troops continue to be bound by the restrictions of the triple-lock system.</P><Col N="1249"/>
      <P>The provisions of the current legislation require immediate reform. In fact, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs commented on the matter in the House last May, he made an interesting remark regarding the Defence Acts:</P>
      <P LI="1">The provisions of the Defence Acts date from a period in which it was not envisaged that the UN would become increasingly reliant upon regional organisations to provide assistance with such operations. In view of the fact that UN reliance on organisations such as the EU is likely to increase rather than diminish, we will continue to monitor and assess the developing situation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Earlier last year, on 9 April 2003, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made an even more interesting comment regarding the Defence Acts:</P>
      <P LI="1">It may be necessary to reflect on the implications of the current position and on ways by which we can overcome the problems which have arisen in this case.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Prior to that, on 30 March 2003, a Government Member of the Seanad, Senator Minihan of the PDs, stated that it was &ldquo;complete nonsense that Ireland has to decline to take part in the EU peacekeeping mission in Macedonia&rdquo;. It seems clear the Government is in agreement with the Fine Gael position on that matter.</P>
      <P>The Defence Acts, which stipulate that a formal UN resolution is required before a contingent of the Defence Forces is dispatched, require amendment. The International Peace Missions Deployment Bill 2003 is the way to effect this change. This Bill would end the triple-lock system and amend the Defence Acts to allow Ireland to send troops to participate in peace missions, even where those missions are not set up as an international UN force. However, the Bill specifically requires that any deployment should be in accord with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. This is detailed in section 3 which states clearly that a contingent of the Defence Forces may only be dispatched &ldquo;where D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is satisfied that the international peace mission accords with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter&rdquo;. In this way, while the mission would not require a formal United Nations resolution, it would be bound by the purposes and principles of the UN. This would remove the current triple-lock system under which Irish participation in peacekeeping missions can continue to be vetoed, but would also ensure that missions would be in accordance with the overarching aims and ambitions of the UN.</P>
      <P>The purposes and principles of the United Nations are laid out in Articles I and II of the United Nations Charter. There is nothing in these articles to which any Member of this House could object. The commitment that any future mission the Defence Forces might participate in would be in accordance with these articles, is in keeping <Col N="1250"/>with the will of the Irish people and the will of this House.</P>
      <P>At European level there are significant movements towards the establishment of a common security and defence architecture. In calling for reform of the triple-lock system, the Bill is in keeping with long-standing Fine Gael policy as set forth by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the document entitled Beyond Neutrality. In that document, Fine Gael called for Ireland not only to become a member of a European common defence and security arrangement, but advocated that Ireland should become an architect of the emerging system. Our reasons for this are clear. With the attempts to reach agreement on a new constitutional treaty for the European Union, matters relating to common defence and security have been discussed. The Government has utterly failed to involve Ireland in these discussions in any meaningful way. It is clear that if we maintain our current position, a common security and defence arrangement will be agreed that reflects the needs and concerns of other European Union member states, but not Ireland&rsquo;s.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael advocates that Ireland should now embrace an open and honest debate on the future of Irish neutrality and we have put forward five key recommendations that should form the bedrock of a future European defence arrangement. In light of developments at European level in recent months and the continuing quest for agreement on a future constitution for the EU, that has eluded us so far, it would be apt to quote each of these five key principles, as follows: 1. adherence to the fundamental principles of the United Nations; 2. a commitment to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and to a solemn undertaking by the European Defence Union, acting as an entity, not to use nuclear or biological weapons; 3. a commitment to mutual defence and support among all EU member states but based on Article V Protocol opt-in arrangements for those states which do not want to make this an automatic provision; 4. a commitment, as a priority, to the provision of resources to peace-keeping and peace-making operations and to the Petersberg Tasks; and, 5. respect for the right of other member states to be involved in other military alliances, such as NATO, if they so wish.</P>
      <P>The first of these five key recommendations is the commitment that any future defence entity should adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations. This commitment is echoed in the International Peace Missions Deployment Bill 2003, which specifically states that missions must be in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The triple-lock mechanism dates from a period when it was not envisaged that the United Nations would become more heavily reliant on regional organisations, such as the European Union, to achieve peace and stability in troubled <Col N="1251"/>areas of the world. This three-part mechanism, whereby the Defence Forces can only take part in military operations that are specifically endorsed by a United Nations resolution, approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and agreed within the Government, is an excessive restriction that has, so far, restricted Defence Force involvement in operations in Macedonia, which have the support of the UN.</P>
      <P>The International Peace Missions Deployment Bill is the mechanism whereby we can amend the Defence Acts, so that the Defence Forces can continue to take part in international United Nations missions. The Bill would also allow them to participate in other peace missions that are in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</P>

	<P>C&eacute; nach n-aonta&iacute;m leis an mBille at&aacute; os comhair na D&aacute;la, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas do na Teachta&iacute; Gay Mitchell agus McGinley as ucht na caoi a thug siad seans don D&aacute;il nithe at&aacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;. Ireland has accorded central importance to the United Nations since it became a member in 1955 and, within the UN system, has supported effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights. Ireland has a long and honourable history in providing personnel to support UN peacekeeping operations throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Ireland made its first contribution to a peace support operation in 1958 by contributing personnel to the observer missions in Lebanon and to UNTSO. Ireland&rsquo;s first troop contribution came shortly after in 1960 with the UN mission in the Congo. Since then, Defence Forces personnel have served all over the world in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the far east and south America, completing more than 50,000 tours of duty with UN led or UN authorised missions. This represents almost 25,000 man years of effort on the part of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The basis of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in international peacekeeping is firmly grounded in the UN. Ireland is, and always has been, a strong and committed supporter of co-operative multilateral arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the UN. Successive Governments have confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s position regarding the UN as the international authority for co-operative arrangements for collective security. In tandem with this, Ireland has recognised and defended the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s policy in this regard was most recently reinforced in the adoption by the people of the Nice treaty. Ireland&rsquo;s act of ratification of the Treaty of Nice has associated with it a national declaration &mdash; the Seville Declaration &mdash; reiterating that the participation of contingents of <Col N="1252"/>the Defence Forces in overseas operations, including those carried out under the European Security and Defence Policy, requires the authorisation of the operation by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations, the agreement of the Government and the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with Irish law.</P>
      <P>In acknowledging Ireland&rsquo;s national declaration, the European Council in Seville in 2002 confirmed that the policy of the Union shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states, in particular Ireland. It also recognised that Ireland would retain the right to take its own sovereign decision, in accordance with its Constitution and laws, on whether to commit military personnel to participate in an operation carried out under European security and defence policy.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government, in emphasising the role of the UN as the international arbiter in the maintenance of international peace and security and the source of legitimacy in international relations, is one which has found favour with the Irish people in their acceptance of the Nice treaty. It is not a position from which we should easily depart.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to move away from Ireland&rsquo;s long held policy in relation to the UN and in relation to our conduct of international relations. The proponents of the Bill suggest that the UN and its decision-making structures are inherently flawed and ineffective. No one is suggesting that the Security Council is the perfect mechanism or that it always functions as effectively as it might. The Secretary General of the UN has acknowledged as much and is committed to further and ongoing review of the role and the effectiveness of the UN and of its structures. However, a failure on the part of the UN is a failure of the members and for the members. As a member of the UN, Ireland is obligated to work to correct the perceived deficiencies and improve the effectiveness of the system and all our efforts, in the first instance, must be directed towards this goal.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, international peacekeeping operations have gone through a sustained period of dramatic change, both qualitative and quantitative. Since the end of the Cold War, international and ethnic tensions, poverty, the struggle for resources, the actions of criminal regimes, destructive political ambitions, human rights abuses and general bad governance led to a fresh series of conflicts and to a major increase in the number of international peacekeeping operations and peace enforcing actions mandated or authorised by the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>Many of the new conflicts have arisen not from international tensions of the kind envisaged in the UN Charter, but from internal conditions. Considerations of sovereignty led to a reluctance on the part of some members of the Security <Col N="1253"/>Council to allow its involvement in civil wars. However, it quickly became clear that civil wars do not necessarily stop at borders; they often spill over into neighbouring countries and threaten international peace and security. This has been well demonstrated in, for instance, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The Security Council, therefore, has increasingly concerned itself with internal conflicts. It has also recognised the need for peace and security to be addressed in a more integrated and long-term way, through the promotion of conflict prevention and peace building, of which good governance, respect for human rights and economic support are key elements.</P>
      <P>The challenges presented by the new conflicts have led to a change in the approach of the international community to them. Peacekeeping during the Cold War had for the most part been approached almost entirely in the context of Chapter VI of the UN Charter, which governs the peaceful settlement of disputes. Military action is not envisaged under Chapter VI and the concept of a UN peacekeeping force, under the ultimate command and control of the UN Secretary General acting in accordance with a mandate enshrined in a Security Council resolution, evolved in the 1950s and early 1960s in response to need.</P>
      <P>This form of peacekeeping, by definition, requires the consent of the parties or, if intra-state, that of the lawful government. Typically, these peacekeeping forces were engaged in support of a ceasefire or truce, or to monitor the implementation of a peace settlement. Where a peace agreement or settlement proved elusive, they prevented conflicts from widening and drawing in the super powers and made life more tolerable for the people in the conflict area, pending political conditions more conducive to the success of a peace process.</P>
      <P>Following the acute situations that have arisen since 1988, the Security Council has resorted more to Chapter VII of the Charter, which is concerned with the restoration of international peace and security in situations where the dispute settlement process has failed. This chapter provides for a series of steps culminating in a mandate to the member states to take such action by land, sea and air as may be necessary to restore international peace and security &mdash; article 42. This robust mandate may be accorded to a traditional peacekeeping force. However, some of the situations have been so serious that they have required the deployment of major military assets led by the more powerful member states. This kind of &ldquo;peace enforcement&rdquo;, authorised by the Security Council and implemented by member states prepared to make military assets available, was envisaged by the framers of the UN Charter in Article 42.</P>
      <P>The UN and the international community have responded to the dramatic changes which have taken place in the world order since the close of <Col N="1254"/>the Cold War and to the challenges which these changes have heralded for international security co-operation and peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>The reliance of the UN on regional organisations to take the lead on UN authorised missions is one of the major developments in the changing environment of UN peacekeeping over recent years. The UN recognises the advantages presented by the existence of regional organisations to which it can assign a mission. Article 53 of the UN Charter envisages the use of regional organisations for enforcement action in the event of threats to international peace and security, subject to the approval of the Security Council for any such action taken by them. There is strong support from regional organisations for these developments. The European Union is supportive of this development and provided the lead role in the recent mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Operation Artemis. The Union is also seeking to improve its early warning and conflict prevention systems. The African union, for instance, has an early warning and conflict prevention unit, and envisages action by African sub-regional bodies, for example the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, in West Africa, and SADC in Southern Africa. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, was established to assist particularly with conflict prevention and peace-building in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War &mdash; the Commonwealth of Independent States, CIS, likewise.</P>
      <P>The Standby High Readiness Brigade, SHIRBRIG, was formed at the initiative of a number of European countries intended to provide a substantial peacekeeping capability to the United Nations. NATO, though primarily a collective defence alliance, is leading certain peace-enforcement actions in KFOR, SFOR, and ISAF with Security Council approval. Ireland is participating and supporting these developments and members of the Defence Forces have served on many of these missions and with these organisations.</P>
      <P>Another key development in UN peacekeeping has been the increasing use of Chapter VII missions under the Charter, commonly referred to as peace making or peace enforcement. This development is one of the factors which has led the UN to mandate to a greater extent the use of regional organisations and coalitions of the willing to enforce its mandates.</P>
      <P>In addition to more robust mandates, UN peacekeeping missions are also becoming significantly more complex involving the full range of responses to a crisis situation. Along with the military task, other elements form a core part of an operation including disarmament, disbandment and reintegration of combatants, the promotion of national reconciliation and respect for human rights; organising and monitoring elections; humanitarian tasks; the re-<Col N="1255"/>establishment of policing, judicial and other state institutions and the restoration of civil society. Peacekeeping is, therefore, now seen in a more holistic manner involving the full spectrum of responses required to build peace and establish a functioning civil society based on respect for international law and human rights.</P>
      <P>There has also been a growing understanding among the international community in recent years of the importance of taking measures in good time to prevent conflict arising in the first place. On 31 January 1992, the Security Council met for the first time at the level of heads of state or governments to consider the new opportunities for international peace and security. Arising from that meeting, the Secretary General responded to a request by the council and submitted a report in June 1992 entitled Agenda for Peace. Since then, there has been increasing recognition of the need, not just for short-term measures to meet immediate crises but also for long-term measures that address the root causes of conflict, involving a multidisciplinary approach that promotes equitable economic and social development, the strengthening of institutions and respect for human rights. Conflict prevention was also a major theme at the UN Millennium Summit.</P>
      <P>In March 2000, the Secretary General of the United Nations convened a high-level panel to undertake a thorough review of the United Nations peace and security activities, and to present a clear set of specific, concrete and practical recommendations to assist the United Nations in conducting such activities better in the future. The panel, comprising a number of eminent personalities with a wide range of experience in the fields of peacekeeping, peace-building, development and humanitarian assistance, was established in response to the failure of the UN in Rwanda and in Srebrenica. The report of the panel, the Brahimi report, recommended structural, financial and systems changes in the manner in which UN peacekeeping operations are planned, supported and implemented.</P>
      <P>The reforms proposed in the Brahimi report continue to be implemented. Moreover, the more recent difficulties experienced by the UN have focused further attention on the need for reform within the UN system and this challenge is being taken up by the UN and the member states and Ireland is fully supportive of this reform process.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With all its flaws, the UN and the Security Council are the mechanisms which we have for the resolution of international conflict and they have stood the test of time. While recognising their limitations, we must also recognise their benefits and seek to ensure that the process of reform addresses the deficiencies which all recognise. Just because the system may have been deemed to have failed in a number of situations, we should not simply seek to discard it. The failure of the system should be a catalyst engendering greater support for the <Col N="1256"/>reform measures and an encouragement to drive forward the reform process more effectively and more expediently. This is the position and policy of the Government. This is the considered approach. It is the proper and correct approach to see how we can make the system work better.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not seek to improve the workings of the UN. It does not support the reform of the UN. If anything, it undermines and represents a turning away from the UN&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>: &mdash;and in the capacity of the UN to deliver and to be reformed. This is not a position which we can or should endorse. Ireland&rsquo;s primary objective at this time should be to reinvigorate the UN and strengthen its structures to allow it the scope to fulfil its mission and the vision of its founding principles which are contained in the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>There has been some suggestion that the Defence Forces have been precluded from participating in missions as a result of the requirements which underpin our involvement in peace support operations. The role of the Defence Forces in peace support operations is set out in the White Paper on Defence. The Defence Forces are assigned the role of participation in multi-national peace support, crisis management and humanitarian operations in support of the United Nations. In furtherance of Government policy to commit Defence Forces personnel in support of UN mandates, Ireland has signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations which commits up to 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system. Ireland has also committed 850 troops to the EU rapid reaction element and participates in the Partnership for Peace. In March 2003, Ireland signed up to the first two stages of membership of the standby high readiness brigade, or SHIRBRIG, which is a brigade strength force available to the United Nations for peacekeeping duties.</P>
      <P>The above commitments are complimentary and mutually reinforcing. Ireland&rsquo;s focus in participating in these arrangements is the development of a capability within the Defence Forces to undertake multi-national peace support operations at the optimum level of inter-operability with participating countries. Ireland&rsquo;s participation should reflect its commitment to collective international peace and security. The enhanced capability being developed arises from our preparations for the EU rapid reaction force. It will therefore serve Ireland&rsquo;s effective <Col N="1257"/>involvement in peace support operations irrespective of who provides the leadership role in a mission.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have risen to the continuing challenges and developments of peacekeeping. Over 65% of Defence Forces personnel have served overseas, a figure which rises to over 85% among officers and NCOs. By participating in UN-authorised peace support operations, the Defence Forces have brought great honour to Ireland. Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well on the nation as a whole and contributes to the excellent reputation which Ireland enjoys among peacekeepers throughout the world. Our commitment to the UN system has not inhibited our capacity to participate in and support new developments in the area of peacekeeping, peace enforcement, conflict prevention and the increasing use of regional organisations. Indeed, our current contribution to UN authorised peace support operations is at its highest level since our withdrawal from UNIFIL in 2001. Ireland participates in 21 missions at present and has 800 personnel serving overseas.</P>
      <P>Other than in the recent case of the EU mission in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, the current regime has not precluded the participation of the Irish Defence Forces in overseas peace support operations. The circumstances which prevented the participation of the Defence Forces in this mission are unlikely to recur. These circumstances, it will be recalled, related to the fact that while United Nations Resolution 1371 welcomed international efforts to support the implementation of the Ohrid peace agreement in Macedonia, it did not authorise an international United Nations force. This latter condition is required by the Defence Acts. This was a particular scenario and I expect future EU Petersberg Tasks missions to have the required UN authorisation. Such authorisation will enable the Government to consider Defence Forces participation on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>The current basis for participation does not, in practice, impede our potential to participate in and contribute to international peace support operations. However, the demand for peacekeepers of the high calibre of the Irish Defence Forces for service on UN authorised peace support operations is significantly in excess of what we can reasonably support within available resources. Our current commitment to Liberia and KFOR, together with the smaller contributions to a wide range of other UN authorised missions, means we are more or less at the limit of our capacity for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Of key concern to my Department and the Defence Forces when considering any mission is the safety and security of our personnel. In considering any mission, one must have regard to the degree of risk involved, the existence of realistic objectives, the requirement for a <Col N="1258"/>sufficiently robust mandate and the adequacy of resourcing the mission. Participation in peacekeeping operations is not without risk. We should recall the 84 members of the Defence Forces who have lost their lives while serving on UN authorised operations. The fact that a mission has been authorised by the UN lends it a legitimacy which is recognised throughout the world by Governments and the protagonists of conflicts. While obviously not an absolute protection, as we have unfortunately seen in recent times, the legitimacy which the UN conveys is respected and accepted as a general principle in most circumstances. There is no other international organisation in the international security arena whose decisions convey a similar authority or legitimacy.</P>
      <P>In the context of the EU Presidency, I would like to expand on the importance the EU attaches to its relationship with the UN, not least in the development of security and defence policies. The centrality of the UN and the primacy of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security is explicitly recognised by the EU. The General Affairs and External Relations Council of 8 December 2003 reaffirmed the deeply rooted commitment of the European Union to make effective multilateralism a central element of its external action. At the heart of this multilateralism is a strong UN. The EU is determined to play a major role within the UN system in line with its objective of developing a stronger international community, international institutions which function well and international relations based on the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>The EU has reaffirmed its intention to contribute actively to the ongoing UN comprehensive reform process. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of UN bodies, policies and processes is a priority for the EU. The Council concluded that the EU&rsquo;s role in UN affairs should be further developed and made commensurate with its present and future contribution in light of enlargement of the Union. This role should be conducive to the achievement of effective multilateralism by building upon the contribution the EU has already made to UN activities. To help the multilateral system to deliver on its core objectives, the Council reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s willingness to improve co-operation with the UN in areas where its contribution may produce significant added value for UN activities. While the European Union has progressively consolidated its contributions to sectors of UN activities, including human rights and economic and social issues such as sustainable development, further efforts should be made to raise its profile. This should be done in respect of all the components of a comprehensive approach to peace, security and development, which are inter-related. The components of this approach include conflict <Col N="1259"/>prevention, crisis management, peacekeeping and peace-building.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Council tasked the Secretary General and Higher Representative to seek to implement the terms of the EU-UN joint declaration of 24 September 2003 on co-operation in crisis management. Practically speaking, the joint declaration implies that EU member states, the Council secretariat and the Commission should intensify their co-ordinated contacts with the UN Secretariat and its departments in this area. Work on the implementation of the joint declaration is under way in terms of planning, training, communication and the development of best practise. Better co-ordination should be achieved between the EU and the UN in addressing disarmament, non-proliferation and terrorism. This should involve joint initiatives, projects and provision of assistance to third countries in the fulfilment of obligations under multilateral instruments and regimes.</P>
      <P>The recently adopted European security strategy recognises that the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It further recognises that strengthening the United Nations and equipping it to fulfil its responsibilities and act effectively is a European priority. As holder of the Presidency, Ireland has been tasked by the European Council with conducting follow-up work in the areas of effective multilateralism, the fight against terrorism, the strengthening of relations with the Middle East and the Arab world and, not least, the development of a comprehensive strategy for Bosnia-Herzegovina. For the purposes of this debate, my focus is on effective multilateralism. As holder of the Presidency as well as in terms of national policy, this is an area to which Ireland attaches particular importance.</P>
      <P>Multilateralism is a recognition that global security can only be achieved through collective action by the international community as a whole. In its security strategy, the EU makes it clear that the United Nations is the crucial organisation in this context. The primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council to ensure international peace and security is clearly endorsed. As holder of the Presidency, Ireland wishes the EU to use its voice at the UN to better effect and to contribute to the current process of UN reform. The European Union constitutes one of the best examples of effective multilateralism in practice. It is natural that the EU should support the principle of multilateralism and work closely with the UN on crisis management issues. The United Nations itself acknowledges the growing benefits of fostering this co-operation to the benefit of both organisations. Mr. Kofi Annan has welcomed the EU&rsquo;s developing civil and military crisis management capabilities.</P><Col N="1260"/>
      <P>As holder of the Presidency, Ireland wants to build on the synergy between the activities of the UN and the EU. There are practical steps which we can take. More effective contacts and co-ordination between the two organisations, which are being put in place, will enable the EU and the UN to respond to challenges which require a rapid response from the international community. The strategy is already paying dividends in terms of EU and UN co-operation as well as in the field of conflict prevention, which lies at the heart of the security strategy. The security strategy clearly states that conflict prevention and threat prevention cannot start too early. The development of a security and defence policy for the EU is therefore consistent with enhancing the UN&rsquo;s capabilities for crisis management and in line with Ireland&rsquo;s proud tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for giving us the opportunity to discuss an important area of Irish foreign policy. I have listened with great care to what he, Deputy McGinley and the Minister for Defence have said. International relations and foreign policy have not been at a lower ebb since the Second World War. I have listened to language such as sustainable development, economic development and human rights etc. There is an enormous disappointment in all these areas.</P>
      <P>In 1999 I launched a book on critical development theory, which had a chapter in it by a colleague, Boaventura de Sousa Santos. In it was an interesting quotation on page 30:</P>
      <P LI="1">With respect to the promise of perpetual peace that Kant formulated so eloquently, while in the eighteenth century 4.4 million people died in 68 wars, in the twentieth century 99 million people died in 237 wars. Between the eighteenth and the twentieth century the world population increased 3.6 times, whereas war casualties increased 22.4 times. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, the peace that many thought at long last possible became a cruel mirage in view of the increase of conflicts among states and inside states.</P>
      <P FLI="0">My beginning point on the present position of foreign policy and international relations has a definition of realism that includes not just a description of what is, but also allows for the possibility of what might be.</P>
      <P>If that is the position on war, it is interesting to note what Boaventura de Sousa Santos had to say about the kind of economy that has arrived internationally:</P>
      <P LI="1">The advanced capitalist countries, amounting to 21 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population, control 78 per cent of the world production of goods and services and consume 75 per cent of all the energy produced. Textile or electronics workers in the Third World earn <Col N="1261"/>twenty times less than workers in Europe and North America doing the same jobs with the same productivity. Since the debt crisis emerged in the early eighties, Third World countries in debt have been contributing to the wealth of the developed countries in liquid terms, by paying them each year an average of $30 billion more than what they get as new loans. During the same period, available food in Third World countries decreased by about 30 per cent. However, the area of soya bean production in Brazil alone would suffice to feed 40 million people if corn and beans were cultivated there instead. More people died of hunger in the twentieth century than in any of the preceding centuries. The gap between rich and poor countries has not stopped widening.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I mention this because today is the 60th anniversary of the publication of <i>The Road to Serfdom </i>by Freidrich A. Hayek. His great fans, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, consider Mr. Hayek a prophet. He is described as a prophet in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. He was wrong in what he said about centrally planned economies. He founded the view of an international economy that has produced misery, death and destruction. This is presented to us as being inevitable. The quotations I have made illustrate something that is important, namely, the moral necessity of rejecting the inevitability of war and the inevitability of a single paradigm of economic development that has produced so much misery and destruction in terms of production, debt and life chances.</P>
      <P>It is also important to restore something that has not been possible in academic circles for nearly 30 years, namely, a normative theory of foreign policy and international relations. This is one that can take interests into account, but argues for a set of transcendent principles that go beyond narrow national interests. One must ask the question of how Ireland is best served. In this we come to a dilemma.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell about the abuse by China of its position over the Macedonian vote. However, other areas of the world are not considered owing to the abuse of the veto. Chechnya is not often discussed because of Russia&rsquo;s position; Tibet is not often discussed because of China&rsquo;s position; and despite the greatest illegalities, Israel is never remonstrated with because of the protection the United States affords it on the Security Council. The veto is used.</P>
      <P>In 1991, one of Ireland&rsquo;s most distinguished foreign servants, the late Erskine Childers published a book with Brian Urquhart on reform of the UN. A second volume was published and Childers worked through the Ford Foundation but also through the Dag Hammarskjold foundation. The debate about reform of the UN was live and vibrant and was getting somewhere. There was also an atmosphere in the time of Olaf Palme and others, and at the time of the Brandt <Col N="1262"/>report in which it seemed that there might be a positive debate about the new international economic order.</P>
      <P>Today, the UN has been tragically damaged. Imperfect as it is, the UN is our only multi-lateral organisation. There was always the prospect of peace in the founding Charter and its principles have been quoted. The American secretary of state, Colin Powell, read matter that was untrue, concocted by the British intelligence services and stolen from a student&rsquo;s PhD thesis. It was invented and twisted for the purpose of facilitating a war. This presentation in February 2003, and the one in November 2002, are the low points since the foundation of the UN when untruths, deceit and propaganda replaced the stuff of statesmanship and diplomacy. International law, theory and foreign policy were degraded and diplomacy would never be the same.</P>
      <P>If integrity is to be restored, it is necessary for Irish foreign policy and international relations that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs go through all the speeches written for Ministers and Ministers of State, and submissions made to the foreign affairs committee, and make certain that they qualify all the statements made about chemical weapons, weapons of mass destruction etc.</P>
      <P>We are faced with a choice. We were preparing for the second Nice treaty referendum when we debated the European Union Act 2001. The explanatory memorandum told us that the first purpose of the Bill was to facilitate scrutiny of European instruments in this House. It continued:</P>
      <P LI="1">The second purpose is to amend the Defence Acts to provide for participation by contingents of the Defence Forces with the EU&rsquo;s Rapid Reaction Force (&lsquo;&lsquo;RRF&rsquo;&rsquo;). The Bill proposes that such participation should be authorised only where the RRF is operating under a mandate given by the Security Council or General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This was an attempt to meet the accountability that the public wanted for defence matters and foreign policy. I have been through all of this argument, most recently regarding the Iraq war. In the course of that, one notices, not just in Ireland or Europe but in the United States and throughout the world, is an incredible difference between the moral instinct and aspiration of people for peace and its unavailability. There is an appalling increase in the proportion of gross domestic product spent on armaments in the United States and in its expenditure on military defence compared with what it spends on overseas development aid. It is a scandal which flies to Heaven. In my other life as an academic, I wonder when new international theories and policies are being constructed whether one can see the great betrayal of the promise of modernity.</P><Col N="1263"/>
      <P>I think about the dangerous period in which we now live. After the war in Iraq and the United States position, there is talk of a multilateralism which that country governs. We are talking about a new imperialism and a contest between imperialisms, namely, that one is either with it or against it in the classical sense. It is not that the United States foreign policy has retreated within the United States or withdrawn from the world. It is reaching out to the world with a definite notion of hegemony that will be imposed at certain costs. We have our own difficulties. We sometimes appear pathetic as we seek to balance an independent foreign policy against what we feel must be the dutiful forelock tugging of a country that relies so much on foreign direct investment. I have often noticed this. One does not need to repeat it again and again without boring oneself.</P>
      <P>It is clear as we listen to the Minister for Defence that, during our Presidency of the EU, one of our great losses has been our inability to deal with the dialogue between Islam and the West. The United Nations recognises this in its structured dialogue between civilisations. The rabid new colonialism is revealed when people speak about imposing democracy and introducing freedom to the Middle East, which has thousands of years of history and its own concept of governance. There are old concepts in China and the Arab world of people working in different types of partnership. Sticking with Friedrich von Hayek, the right that was presented by Reagan and Thatcher spoke about freedom being defined on individualism. This is when one loses the freedom of the person and one speaks of the freedom of the individual, this isolated fear-ridden person who is now at the high point of our civilisation. The language of anti-terrorism is a language of introducing fear to the heart of domestic and foreign policy. We should be afraid and spend more on armaments and militarisation. There is the notion of co-operating in sharing fear and responding to it.</P>
      <P>I cannot support the Bill because I believe we should begin reconstructing foreign policy and international policy by seeking to strengthen the United Nations. This will be a difficult task. It is unlikely that those who already hold veto powers in the Security Council will easily cede those powers. There are possibilities for reform of the General Assembly. There were possibilities through the history of the United Nations. There were strategies such as &ldquo;united for peace&rdquo; and so on. Other reforms are possible but, more importantly, there are other redefinitions throughout the work of the United Nations which would bring some prospects. For example, there is the concept of humanitarian intervention. Let us assume we go the other way and participate without the triple lock in military interventions. They will be called humanitarian interventions. As Dr. Sanoon recently wrote in the international <Col N="1264"/>law journal, humanitarian intervention as a concept has, in fact, been abused since the time of Mussolini in North Africa. Everyone uses humanitarian intervention as a justification. It would be much better to begin to think of a concept of human rights protection. What is the difference? On the one hand, one is invited to protect human rights and to try to establish a scheme of universal rights and, on the other, one is deciding the basis for one&rsquo;s intervention. One has a legacy of history and colonialism behind it while the other does not.</P>
      <P>The Brahimi proposals are rather vague. However, we must support this work. I disagree with Deputy Gay Mitchell&rsquo;s fundamental document, Beyond Neutrality, which is the source of the Bill. It is only consistent that he would produce legislation such as this out of the document. He knows that I fundamentally disagree with Beyond Neutrality. In the 1970s, my writings on neutrality used the concept of positive neutrality. I never regarded it as a burden, nor do I now. The origin of the Neutrality League, founded in Ireland for the first time, dates much further back than Mr. de Valera&rsquo;s extraordinary definition of it. It was based on the principle that it is working people who die in war.</P>
      <P>In the recent war in Iraq, just one person from the United States Congress had a son or daughter in Iraq. Just six have any connection with the war. Wars are fought with other people&rsquo;s children. They are fought with the children of minorities and working people. The people who founded the original Neutrality League saw that. They also saw the horror of war. The major difference with the First World War, which was around the time of that thinking in relation to human casualties, is that after that war, civilians rather than combatants would die.</P>
      <P>We must begin to make the case not just against war but for forms of co-operation and genuine multilateralism that will bring us the prospect of peace. We must also question inevitability. There is no case of having a single economic model which has not been a great oppression on the world. That means being free to challenge the neo-liberal model and the development theory.</P>
      <P>One of the most tragic aspects of the European Union is the way the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; defined in a military way is coming into usage. If one goes back to Kant in the 18th century and the prospect for peace, it was a recognition of our mutual interdependence on each other and the possibility of constructing recognitions and ethics of freedom and so on. From this came a strong philosophical tradition. We are now dealing with a terror in which those who seek to oppose terror practice destruction of freedom of both the person and society. Why should we structure our policy on either fear or the inevitability of a military response or a military definition of security? If we are to define security, even as it is, it would take several generations. The <Col N="1265"/>elimination of the experience of poverty, death and destruction and the crushing of different cultures, languages and experiences is the way we must go. We should put our energies into trying to reform the United Nations. We should then look at the appropriate relationship between regional structures and the United Nations.</P>
      <P>We should not forget easily those who said they will operate without a UN resolution but act in accordance with the principles of the Charter. That was what Colin Powell said on the eve of the Iraq war. It was also what Mr. Blair&rsquo;s representative said when retreating from the requirement of obtaining a second resolution on the war in Iraq. They suggested that their actions, with the coalition of the willing, would be in accordance with the Charter and the principles. If the connection is written off between the UN General Assembly, the decisions of the Security Council, however imperfect, and the UN Charter and its principles, one moves oneself to the side of the line of those who have deeply harmed the UN. However difficult and uncomfortable it is and however bleak the prospects might be in the short term, we must be at the other side of that line. We must seek to convince other nations that the only way to ensure genuine multilateralism is when these hegemonies of the militarily strong, those with the new imperial mission and those who, to their credit, have most recently damaged the UN are opposed. On behalf of the Labour Party, I oppose this Bill.</P>

	<P>Sula cuireadh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar athl&oacute; bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint ar th&aacute;bhacht na Gaeilge agus ar th&aacute;bhacht na seachtaine seo. Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m, uair amh&aacute;in eile, leis na daoine a chuir an smaoineamh seo ar aghaidh. Beidh m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht go cruinn agus go c&uacute;ramach lena mbeidh le r&aacute; ag an bhFreas&uacute;ra.</P>
      <P>Is aisteach an rud &eacute; nach mb&iacute;onn n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; sa Teach seo ar an nGaeilge. Scait&iacute;, ceapaim go mb&iacute;onn fait&iacute;os ar dhaoine ceist na Gaeilge a phl&eacute;. Creidim go bhfuil todhcha&iacute; ag an nGaeilge. Ceann des na ruda&iacute; is m&oacute; a thugaim faoi deara &aacute;it ar bith sa t&iacute;r n&aacute; go bhfuil daoine &oacute;ga le Gaeilge agus a bhfuil sp&eacute;is acu sa Ghaeilge. B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil sin ann de thoradh na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta ach s&iacute;lim f&eacute;in go bhfuil s&eacute; ann ar ch&uacute;is eile freisin, is &eacute; sin, go bhfuil an sean droch-mheas a bh&iacute; ag &Eacute;ireannaigh orthu f&eacute;in agus an tuairim a bh&iacute; ag go leor daoine go gcaithfear dul <Col N="1266"/>ar imirce le maitheas a dh&eacute;anamh, imithe imeasc an aosa &oacute;ig. Creideann aos &oacute;g na t&iacute;re seo anois go bhfuil todhcha&iacute; acu ina dt&iacute;r f&eacute;in, gur f&eacute;idir leo dul thar s&aacute;ile &mdash; go deimhin, is beag duine &oacute;g sa t&iacute;r nach raibh thar s&aacute;ile ag am &eacute;igin &mdash; ach ag an am gc&eacute;ana creideann siad go bhfuil a dtodhcha&iacute; sa t&iacute;r seo m&aacute; roghna&iacute;tear &eacute; sin, agus roghna&iacute;onn a bhformh&oacute;r m&oacute;r &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
      <P>Rud amh&aacute;in go bhfuil m&eacute; buartha faoi n&aacute; go bhfuil dh&aacute; aicme ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os sa t&iacute;r. T&aacute; dream le Gaeilge an-mhaith &mdash; agus t&aacute; siad i ngach uile choirn&eacute;al den t&iacute;r &mdash; agus feictear dom go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ann anois nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith acu. Is deacair dom a thuiscint c&eacute;n chaoi is f&eacute;idir le daoine 13 bliana a chaitheamh ar scoil agus gan an Ghaeilge a thabhairt leo. Is ceist &iacute; sin go gcaithfimid breathn&uacute; air go dearfach agus ceist a chur orainn fein c&eacute;n chaoi a dtarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin. C&eacute;n chaoi gur f&eacute;idir leis tarl&uacute; go mbeife&aacute; ag su&iacute; istigh i rang ag &eacute;isteacht le Gaeilge l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae, seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine agus bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus nach dtabharf&aacute; fi&uacute; cupla abairt leat? Is ceist mh&oacute;r teangeola&iacute;ochta &iacute; sin, chomh maith le gach uile sh&oacute;rt eile.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ag fanacht i mo theach f&eacute;in san nGaeltacht ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus, tar &eacute;is b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir seacht n&oacute; ocht n&oacute; 10 mbliana ar scoil, gan iad in ann tr&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre abairt a chur le ch&eacute;ile. Ach tar &eacute;is tr&iacute; seachtain&iacute; bh&iacute;odar r&eacute;as&uacute;nta l&iacute;ofa agus in ann iad f&eacute;in a gcur in i&uacute;l agus comhr&aacute; a choinne&aacute;il. M&aacute; bh&iacute;odar in ann an m&eacute;id sin a fhoghlaim i dtr&iacute; seachtain&iacute; le caitheamh aimsire agus le spraoi agus sp&oacute;rt, ba dheacair dom a thuiscint c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach shin an chaoi a rabhamar ag m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna? Is minic a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; ina dhiaidh sin go mb&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mba cheart d&uacute;inn &eacute;ir&iacute; as bheith ag m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge mar at&aacute;imid &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agus go mb&rsquo;fhearr teilif&iacute;se&aacute;in a gcur isteach sa rang scoile agus cupla cart&uacute;n a chur air agus go mb&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfoghlaimeodh na gas&uacute;ir an Ghaeilge i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr ar an mbealach sin. Go deimhin, is &eacute; an chaoi a fhoghlaim&iacute;onn gas&uacute;ir teanga n&aacute; &oacute; bheith ag &eacute;isteacht le ruda&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile.</P>
      <P>Is minic a chonaic muid daoine a raibh Gaeilge mhaith acu ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il na scoile ach gur imigh siad as cleachtadh. Nuair a castar orthu deich mbliana ina dhiaidh sin n&iacute;l an d&aacute; fhocal f&eacute;in fanta acu. &Oacute; tharla go bhfuil TG4 ann agus i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine le Gaeilge ag breathn&uacute; ar chl&aacute;racha Gaeilge agus ar chluich&iacute; peile ar TG4, beidh s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il a fheice&aacute;il an gcoinneoidh siad sin i dti&uacute;in i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; leis an nGaeilge n&aacute; mar a choinnigh an ghl&uacute;in nach raibh aon teagmh&aacute;il acu le Gaeilge nuair a d&rsquo;fh&aacute;g siad an scoil. Ceann des na ruda&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha a bhain leis an Acht teanga go mbeadh an Ghaeilge feice&aacute;lach, go mbeadh s&iacute; mar chuid den saol taobh amuigh den scoil agus mar ghn&aacute;th chuid de shocha&iacute; na t&iacute;re. Thar aon mhe&aacute;n eile, t&aacute; an teilif&iacute;s cumhachtach. Arda&iacute;onn s&eacute; mo chro&iacute; an m&eacute;id daoine a bhreathna&iacute;onn ar na cluich&iacute; agus ar a leith&eacute;id de Ros na R&uacute;n agus na cl&aacute;racha eile a bh&iacute;onn ar TG4. S&iacute;lim go mbeidh tionchar aige sin ar thuiscint dhaoine a <Col N="1267"/>chaillfeadh an teanga murach &eacute; agus, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, ar a gcumas &iacute; a labhairt.</P>
      <P>I ngach uile choirn&eacute;al den t&iacute;r feicimid daoine at&aacute; in ann agallamh a dh&eacute;anamh i nGaeilge. Scait&iacute; b&iacute;onn siad s&aacute;ch briotach agus scait&iacute; eile b&iacute;onn siad thar cinn. Ach n&iacute;l rud ar bith a tharl&oacute;dh sa t&iacute;r n&oacute; &aacute;it ar bith a dtiocf&aacute; nach bhfaighf&iacute; daoine le Gaeilge, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir daoine nach Gaeilgeoir&iacute; iad ach at&aacute; in ann agallamh a dh&eacute;anamh tr&eacute; Ghaeilge agus iad f&eacute;in a chur in i&uacute;l.</P>
      <P>Is rud maith &eacute; go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ann agus go bhfuil aird an T&iacute; d&iacute;rithe ar cheist na Gaeilge, ar th&aacute;bhacht na Gaeilge agus ar an st&aacute;das at&aacute; ag an nGaeilge sa t&iacute;r seo, is &eacute; sin, gurb &iacute; an ch&eacute;ad teanga oifigi&uacute;il agus teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na t&iacute;re &iacute;.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo an-th&aacute;bhacht ar fad. Aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire nuair a deir s&eacute; go mba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; sa Teach as Gaeilge. Gan aon dabht, t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt n&aacute; mar a labhra&iacute;tear sa tsean-am.</P>
      <P>Since we got our independence we have spent a great deal of money on the Irish language. T&aacute; na milli&uacute;in punt caite ins na scoileanna, ins na Gaeltachta&iacute; agus ins na me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide. T&aacute; feabhsanna tagtha &oacute; thaobh na Gaelainne de agus t&aacute; st&aacute;das n&iacute;os fearr, st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il, aici sa t&iacute;r. T&aacute; airgead faighte ag Conradh na Gaeilge agus na dreamanna a bhfuil suim acu san nGaelainn agus chun an Ghaelainn a chur ar aghaidh. T&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; go maith le Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus ag TG4. Ag an am gc&eacute;ana n&iacute;l an Ghaelainn ag dul ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht. N&iacute; fheadar an bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine &oacute;ga ag labhairt na Gaelainne anois n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; 20 bliain &oacute; shin.</P>
      <P>We must consider how the Irish language has progressed since the foundation of the State. Statistics show that in 1926 there were 530,000 Irish speakers while from the recent census more than 1 million people claim to have a reasonable knowledge of the language. However, the number of Gaeltacht speakers has reduced alarmingly, despite the great investment and financial support successive Governments have given to the Gaeltacht. The Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta report shows that young people in Gaeltacht areas are not as attracted to the language as they used to be. It is feared that many of these areas will disappear in one, two or three generations&rsquo; time. This is the one issue we are all trying to address and prevent from happening.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of money, State support or goodwill in the communities. For some reason the language is not as attractive as it used to be. There were economic reasons in the past. When people emigrated, the language was not seen as much use in securing a job abroad. The language is now useful to people, but that psychological barrier still remains when attempting to increase its usage. I have three sons who went to the Kerry Gaeltacht in the summer, where they had a good time; bh&iacute; am an-mhaith acu. Caithfimid m&eacute; a r&aacute; <Col N="1268"/>nach labhra&iacute;onn siad Gaeilge anois. Iarraim orthu Gaeilge a labhairt agus an rud beag seo a dh&eacute;anamh, ach n&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaidh siad &eacute;. N&iacute;l siad buartha f&aacute; Gaeilge a labhairt. They are not concerned about speaking Irish. Perhaps it is because they are young or perhaps it is because they do not realise the importance of a historic language or the richness and wealth of the culture, such as its beautiful poetry and writing, but the reality is that they are not speaking it.</P>
      <P>As I said, despite our best will, that is a significant issue for the parents who are driving and helping in the issue &oacute; thaobh na nGaelscoileanna d&eacute;. The number of Gaelscoileanna has increased successfully, but the reality is that it is a primary school movement at the moment, and if a student wants to continue his or her secondary education in Irish, it is not possible to do so. I think that only about five post-primary schools have Gaelscoileanna. That issue must be addressed because when students who learn all their subjects through the medium of Irish in primary school go into the post-primary sphere, the opportunity to go to a Gaelscoil does not exist for the vast majority of them. The Gaelscoileanna movement is an active and progressive movement. It links in with post-primary schools throughout the country to try to press the issue and make progress on it, but the reality is that there is not an equal driving force in the Department of Education and Science that puts forward that agenda successfully. That must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Another issue that must be addressed is the availability of textbooks in Irish. An ceann is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; focl&oacute;ir. Where do our focl&oacute;ir come from? If one goes into the main bookshop in Dingle to which I go, the most recent focl&oacute;ir one can find goes back to some time in the 1980s &mdash; I cannot give the exact year. We are about 20 years behind. If somebody wants to use a modern dictionary, such is not available. Efforts are being made in that regard, and an important, academic and worthwhile project is under way, but we should do more on the Idirl&iacute;on. I would like to have greater access to a general knowledge focl&oacute;ir to research speeches for the D&aacute;il and pick up some more modern words than my school-based vocabulary. There have been a lot of successes, but the basic point about a dictionary in Irish needs to be addressed. It is silly that we do not have a modern one. The availability of other textbooks is also a serious disadvantage to those who want to learn Irish.</P>
      <P>I will say a few words about going to the Gaeltacht and compare it to language schools in other languages in our country. Again, as a parent, I can speak from personal experience. Two of my children have gone to French summer schools in different colleges. Having done so, they have successfully increased their use of French, but the same was not true of their experience in the Gaeltacht. That is not a criticism of the professionalism or the knowledge of the teachers <Col N="1269"/>concerned. Perhaps we need to be more focused in our summer schools in Irish. Perhaps we need to look at and learn from the new language courses. They may be more dynamic than some of the courses that are available in the Gaeltacht. I am not criticising the people who are involved in those. I have no doubt that the people who went to the Minister&rsquo;s home to learn Irish could not have gone to a better place.</P>
      <P>The bean an t&iacute; and the fear an t&iacute; throughout the Gaeltacht areas are committed to what they do, and no money will pay them for that. Few couples will give over their homes for three months in the summer to help people who speak Irish, so they have made a great contribution. Nevertheless, I am not convinced go bhfuil an caighde&aacute;n chomh hard n&oacute; chomh nua-aimseartha agus a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute;. That may or may not be controversial, but it is my personal view.</P>
      <P>The added value of a holiday in the Gaeltacht could certainly be improved in terms of the available facilities and amenities. There is a lack of progress and amenities. There has certainly been no planned improvement in the Gaeltacht areas, although I am again probably only talking about Kerry. I would love some of the money that goes into the courses to be used significantly to improve the amenities for the young people who are on the courses. Perhaps the Minister will work out with the course providers a sum of money that could be put aside each year, if that is not already being done, to target such improvements. I have looked for many years at the same old derelict basketball court with the netting gone. It is just not good enough and it is not acceptable. People spend money in the Gaeltacht and they do not get value for it. The amenities should be improved. That would also add greatly to the lives of others who are not on Irish courses but have children in the area and might want to use the amenities.</P>
      <P>We have worked together well in Parliament on Irish language issues. There is no fundamental disagreement between us, although there is a difference of emphasis and of policy on, for example, the status of Irish in the European Union. Fundamentally, we are all together, and the Minister&rsquo;s speech, which I have read, was made in the spirit of that collective effort to improve matters. Tonight is not an opportunity for scoring political points.</P>
      <P>Sa chuid seo den t&iacute;r sna bunscoileanna, t&aacute; m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge uaf&aacute;sach ar fad. N&iacute;l treoracha &oacute;n Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de. I say that in inverted commas. Particularly on this eastern seaboard, the teaching of Irish in primary schools is inadequate. It is just not good enough. The Minister said that he is concerned, as we all are, that young people leave primary school without two words of Irish to put together or unable to put two sentences together. We need to direct our attention to the teaching of Irish in primary schools. We need a radical reappraisal of where <Col N="1270"/>we are going and of the quality of the product, which in some cases is very poor, at the end of the primary school years. It is just not good enough that students leave school with no knowledge of the language. I am not blaming individual teachers, I am saying that a new ethos, a new focus and a new approach are needed in the teaching of Irish in primary schools. If we had those, we might make progress and our children would leave school with some basic, fundamental knowledge of and interest in the language.</P>
      <P>Peig Sayers may no longer be on the curriculum, and I would not criticise the oral tradition, but the heroes of young people are modern. They are U2, Westlife or whoever. We need to focus all our attention on making it attractive to speak the language. To speak young people&rsquo;s language in Irish, we have to mirror their lives and interest, and we have failed to do that. That is the challenge. It shows us the need for reappraisal. It is the future of Irish. If there is to be a future for Irish, it must be in a radical reappraisal of all those issues.</P>
      <P>Aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta sa Teach as Gaeilge agus molaim a m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;, go speisialta faoi chl&aacute;r leathuair a chloig sa tseachtain as Gaelainn ar TG4. M&aacute; labharfaidh Teachta Gaelainn istigh anseo, n&iacute; bheidh s&eacute; ar an teilif&iacute;s agus ba cheart go mbeadh. Is teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta &iacute; an Ghaeilge ach n&iacute;l suim ag na hiriseoir&iacute; sa Ghaeilge. T&aacute; suim ag TG4, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus cuid de na nuacht&aacute;in ach de ghn&aacute;th is cuma le formh&oacute;r na me&aacute;n. Caithfimid sin a athr&uacute;.</P>
      <P>Molaim Seachtain na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh coic&iacute;s na Gaeilge ann an bhliain seo chugainn. T&aacute; muid uilig ar chomhaigne agus d&aacute;ir&iacute;re &oacute; thaobh polasa&iacute; na Gaeilge go ginear&aacute;lta. C&eacute; nach bhfuil Gaelainn ag achan duine sa Teach, t&aacute; meas acu uirthi. Sin rud an-mhaith don am at&aacute; romhainn. Molaim an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus beidh m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis na cainteoir&iacute; uilig.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil seans agam cupla focal a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a bhaineann linn go l&eacute;ir. Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; faoin t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le bun&uacute; Theilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Aonta&iacute;m go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh t&eacute;acsleabhair ar f&aacute;il ins na scoileanna ionas go mbeadh na h&aacute;bhair go l&eacute;ir ar f&aacute;il go rialta gan str&oacute; acu san a dteasta&iacute;onn uathu &aacute;bhair a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge. T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach chomh maith go gcuirfear feabhas suntasach ar oili&uacute;int mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ar chaighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il ins na scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Agus m&eacute; ag ullmh&uacute; dos na r&aacute;itis seo bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag l&eacute;amh p&iacute;osa taighde a rinne Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Ruairc, An Inquiry into the experience of Language Shift in an Irish Context. Bh&iacute; an t-Uasal &Oacute; Ruairc ina scol&aacute;ire iar-ch&eacute;ime in ollscoil i Londain nuair a rinne s&eacute; agallaimh le seachtar gcainteoir a raibh Gaeilge acu. L&eacute;irigh siad an taith&iacute; a bh&iacute; acu ar an <Col N="1271"/>saol m&oacute;r tar &eacute;is na Gaeltachta&iacute; a bhf&aacute;g&aacute;il agus a bheith ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; i Londain. Is cuimhin liom an frithfheachtas i gcoinne Theilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge. L&eacute;irigh an feachtas sin nithe &aacute;irithe dom f&eacute;in agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-chonsp&oacute;ideach nuair a labhair m&eacute; faoi ag oscailt oifigi&uacute;il an st&aacute;isi&uacute;in, is &eacute; sin an self loathing a bh&iacute; i gceist.</P>
      <P>Is &iacute;ontach an rud n&aacute;r cailleadh an teanga go hioml&aacute;n mar br&uacute;dh an athr&uacute; teanga orainn. Achta&iacute;odh an ch&eacute;ad acht in gcoinne &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge i gCill Choinnigh i 1366 agus lean an polasa&iacute; uaidh sin. Sa 19&uacute; a cailleadh an chuid is m&oacute; den teanga.</P>
      <P>Is &eacute; seo a d&uacute;irt Frantz Fanon i 1977:</P>
      <P LI="1">Every colonised people &mdash; in other words every people in whose soul an inferiority complex has been created by the death and burial of its local cultural originality &mdash; finds itself face to face with the language of the civilising nation: that is, with the culture of the mother country. The colonized is elevated above his jungle status in proportion to his adoption of the mother country&rsquo;s cultural standards. He becomes whiter as he renounces his blackness, his jungle.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Scr&iacute;odh i 1996 faoin f&eacute;in-ghr&aacute;in a thagann as sin:</P>
      <P LI="1">In the Irish case differences in language and expression became equated not only with the comic but with the inept.</P>
      <P FLI="0">T&aacute; sin an-th&aacute;bhachtach. Is &eacute; an rud a bh&iacute; ag cur as dona l&aacute;n des na daoine a bh&iacute; i gcoinne, mar shampla, bhun&uacute; Theilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge n&aacute; go raibh an teanga ann f&oacute;s agus nach raibh s&iacute; marbh. D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; nach raibh s&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtach d&oacute;ibh ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&iacute; marbh. Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge mar s&oacute;rt paradox den phearsantacht a cheap siad a ba ch&oacute;ir a bheith acu.</P>
      <P>Tugann an file Nuala N&iacute; Dhomhnaill &ldquo;teanga na M&oacute;rmh&aacute;thar&rdquo; ar an nGaeilge. Ceann des na moth&uacute;ch&aacute;in nua at&aacute; agam f&eacute;in i leith na Gaeilge n&aacute; go dtugann s&iacute; seans dom teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis an samhla&iacute;ocht a bh&iacute; ag mo shinsir, is &eacute; sin, an ceangal idir na gl&uacute;ine at&aacute; imithe a neart&uacute; agus teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis an oidhreacht sin.</P>
      <P>Scr&iacute;obhann an stara&iacute;, Joe Lee, faoin nGaeilge agus faoi gcaoi inar bheag n&aacute;r chailleamar &iacute;. Scr&iacute;obh s&eacute; i 1989:</P>
      <P LI="1">It may be that there is an Irish emotional reality which is silenced in English. It may be too that many Irish no longer experience that emotional reality, that it has been parched out of them, that a particular stream of Irish consciousness has dried up with the decay of the language.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Muna bhfuil do theanga agat n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an sc&eacute;al ioml&aacute;n a bheith agat agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an stair ioml&aacute;n a bhaili&uacute;. Caithfidh t&uacute; a bheith ag obair an t-am go l&eacute;ir tr&iacute; theanga eile. In&aacute;r gc&aacute;s is &eacute; sin an B&eacute;arla. Deir Joe Lee chomh maith:</P><Col N="1272"/>
      <P LI="1">[Irish] fell into bad company again with the founding of the State. The ethos of the official revival, despite the commitment of genuine revivalists, fostered precisely those qualities of the national character that were accentuated by colonial experience, ambiguity, evasiveness, furtiveness, mendacity.....</P>
      <P LI="1">The blind frenzy that can still be provoked by the defiant refusal of a conquered language to lie down and die exposes the destructive passions smouldering behind the facade of metropolitan rationality.</P>
      <P FLI="0">B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go raibh an c&oacute;il&iacute;neachas agus an chaoi inar br&uacute;dh an B&eacute;arla orainn mar &uacute;dar ar an ch&eacute;ad ionsa&iacute; ar an dteanga f&eacute;in agus ar laghd&uacute; na teanga ins an 19&uacute; aois. Caithfimid an cheist a cur orainn f&eacute;in, cad at&aacute; taobh thiar den doicheall at&aacute; ann an Ghaeilge a bheith againn? Sin an rud a bh&iacute; i gceist ag Joe Lee i 1989 agus a bh&iacute; taobh thiar d&oacute;ibh san a bh&iacute; chomh dearg sin i gcoinne Theilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Scr&iacute;obh Joe Lee:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is more unusual for descendants of a destroyed culture to join in the disparagement of a lost language. It smacks of a parricidal impulse. The failure to revive the language has to be justified on the grounds that the discarded language was not worth reviving anyway. The values of the destroyer can thus be legitimised and internalised.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Bh&iacute; an meon sin le sonr&uacute; san bhfrithfheachtas i gcoinne Theilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ann f&oacute;s. D&rsquo;&eacute;irigh le Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge agus le Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta. Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an Aire faoi Ros na R&uacute;n.

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;ochach go bhfuil seans agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo. D&uacute;irt daoine eile go raibh bata scoir ag daoine na blianta fada &oacute; shin agus cuireadh scor ar an bhata nuair a labhair gas&uacute;r Gaeilge. Sin an chaoi a bh&iacute; ann agus throid daoine sa d&oacute;igh is go mbeadh an seans acu an teanga a labhairt. T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeimis ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta d&rsquo;achan duine at&aacute; in ann c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute;. T&aacute; daoine sa t&iacute;r seo at&aacute; ar lorg seans Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id. Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mo dhocht&uacute;ir teaghlaigh ar na hoile&aacute;in, casadh daoine aosta orm a labharfadh liom nuair nach raibh ach c&uacute;pla focal agam. Bhain siad taitneamh as a bheith ag tarraingt c&uacute;pla focal asam.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; a l&aacute;n daoine &oacute;ga aga bhfuil suim sa teanga, na m&iacute;lte sna Gaelscoileanna a bh&iacute;onn ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus ag baint taitnimh as sin agus suim mh&oacute;r acu sa nGaeilge. T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; eile ann a bhaineann leis an teanga &mdash; an cult&uacute;r agus an traidisi&uacute;in at&aacute; againn sa t&iacute;r seo. T&aacute; baint agam leis na geolta in Acaill agus t&aacute; sin an-th&aacute;bhachtach don &aacute;it. T&aacute; cuidi&uacute; tugtha do na geolta ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus TG4 agus pl&eacute;ann siad na ruda&iacute; sin ag a bhfuil baint acu leis an teanga agus leis an chult&uacute;r.</P>
      <P>Bh&iacute; baint agam leis an ngluaiseacht chun na ngeolta a chur ar ais ar an fharraige &mdash; n&iacute; raibh ach tr&iacute; cheann acu f&aacute;gtha dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin agus bheadh blianta ann nach mbeadh aon r&aacute;s ann ar ch&oacute;ir ar bith.

B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh 20 gheolta ar an fharraige i mbliana agus bainfidh gach duine sult as agus labharfaidh siad as Gaeilge. Beidh coisir againn tar &eacute;is na r&aacute;sa&iacute; le duaiseanna agus labharfaimid tr&eacute; Ghaeilge an t-am ar fad. T&aacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach mar is dea-shampla &eacute; do na daoine &oacute;ga a spreagfaidh suim iontu sa Ghaeilge. Sin an d&oacute;igh at&aacute; an Gaeilge ag f&aacute;s anois. T&aacute; TG4 ag cur na Gaeilge chun cinn, t&aacute; seans ag gach duine c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an teilif&iacute;s.</P><Col N="1275"/>
      <P>Bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n Gaeilge ag mo mh&aacute;thair agus ag mo sheanmh&aacute;thair agus bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge an-l&aacute;idir san &aacute;it inar ch&oacute;naigh siad. T&aacute; daoine aosta ann at&aacute; an-s&aacute;sta an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus is f&eacute;idir leis an Rialtas rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh ar a son leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. T&aacute; muid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag iarraidh go labharfaidh daoine &oacute;ga an Ghaeilge ach cad faoi daoine eile? B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil siad as cleachtadh agus d&aacute; mbheadh seans acu, labharfaid&iacute;s tuilleadh.</P>
      <P>Thugainn cuairt ar an nGaeltacht nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; &oacute;g agus bhaininn an-taitneamh as. Sa Loch&aacute;n Beag chas m&eacute; ar Ph&oacute;l &Oacute; Foighil, a rinne an-obair ar son na Gaeilge. Bhuail m&eacute; leis uair amh&aacute;in nuair a bh&iacute; cail&iacute;n agam ar handlebars mo rothar. I was fortunate I was not sent home. Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ag an am sin. T&aacute; cuimhne mhaith agam ar na ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; le f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht. Chonaic m&eacute; cult&uacute;r na Gaeltachta, na c&eacute;ililthe agus an craic. N&iacute; raibh alc&oacute;il le f&aacute;il ach bhaineamar an-taitneamh as na himeachta&iacute;.</P>
      <P>The outlook of TG4 in projecting Irish is wonderful. It is a symbol of modern Irish and a great tradition. It provides a showcase for the Irish language and culture which has not been available until the present. I am involved with Cumann B&aacute;d&oacute;ir&iacute; Acla in the promotion of the Achill yawls. We try to conduct as much of our work through Irish and to use it in our gatherings afterwards when we present prizes. That gives young people a view that Irish is not just something they have in school. The fact that Irish is no longer compulsory is an advantage. Young people see that people enjoy speaking Irish and things Irish. This is important for the yawl centre which we are setting up. The involvement of people in friendly competition in Achill, Mulranny, Corraun and Clare Island will showcase the yawl, which is symbolic of the rich tradition of the area. The yawl has a rich history and our project gives people an opportunity to experience that history and to experience the yawl and the sea. I pay tribute to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta which has been supportive of these projects and of aon rud a thugann seans do dhaoine cupla focal Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.</P>
      <P>A debate took place in the House recently on the adoption of Irish as an official language in the EU. That would certainly help. The point has often been made that it is important to strengthen the language at home. The Minister has a great interest in doing that. T&aacute; an-athas orm go raibh seans agam labhairt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.</P>

N&iacute; f&eacute;idir, fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in, teacht ar leaganacha Gaeilge den &aacute;bhar bollscaireachta a thagann &oacute; Choimisi&uacute;n na hEorpa toisc nach teanga oifigi&uacute;il &iacute;.

T&aacute; an Roinn f&eacute;in ann, chomh maith le Comhdh&aacute;il Naisi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge, a chuir comhairle ar f&aacute;il do gach &eacute;inne thar na blianta.

      <P>T&aacute; muid tar &eacute;is Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a reacht&aacute;il agus an Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga a cheapadh. T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre ach t&uacute;s an-bheag at&aacute; ann. Nuair a bh&iacute; mise ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os na blianta &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; s&eacute; de phribhl&eacute;id agam go raibh beirt mh&uacute;inteoir agam ag a raibh scoth na Gaeilge. Chuirfeadh s&eacute; an-&aacute;thas orm da mb&eacute;adh an l&iacute;ofacht agamsa a bh&iacute;odh acusan, ach n&iacute;l s&eacute;. T&aacute; an-mhuin&iacute;n agam as an gc&oacute;ras oideachais le hathr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar saol na t&iacute;re agus saol teangan freisin. Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os ba &iacute; an Ghaeilge teanga an bhochtanais, an imirce, an d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta agus drochthith&iacute;ochta.</P>
      <P>N&iacute;l an tuairim sin aistrithe f&oacute;s. Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Teachta O&rsquo;Dowd ag labhairt n&iacute;os luaithe. T&aacute; muid ag dul i dtreise in &aacute;iteanna &aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh oideachais na Gaeilge, t&aacute; scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaelacha ag d&eacute;anamh s&aacute;r-job, cuid acu i mo dh&aacute;ilcheanntar f&eacute;in. C&eacute; a cheapfadh go mb&eacute;adh scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaelach i l&aacute;r Bhaile Munna? Bhuail m&eacute; i ndiaidh le gr&uacute;pa &oacute; Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona i nGlas Naion, scoil at&aacute; ann le fada, agus labhair m&eacute; leo tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus chuir siad ceisteanna orm as Gaeilge. T&aacute; imn&iacute; orm anois go bhfuil deighilt idir an scola&iacute;ocht at&aacute; le f&aacute;il sa ghn&aacute;thscoil agus Gaeilge &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh agus an scola&iacute;oct at&aacute; sna scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaelacha. T&aacute; yuppies de shaghas ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os i roinnt de na scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaelacha agus n&iacute; maith &eacute; sin. Caithfimid borradh &eacute;igean a chur sna gn&aacute;thscoileanna agus t&eacute;acsanna agus uirlis&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr a chur ar f&aacute;il, &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as TG4 sa rang mar t&aacute; s&aacute;r-obair d&eacute;anta ag TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta. T&aacute; imn&iacute; orm nach f&eacute;idir an ceangal a dh&eacute;anamh idir gn&aacute;thshaol na ndaoine agus m&uacute;ineadh agus foghlaim na teanga. N&iacute;l an cheist sin ag dul i bhfeabhas. T&aacute; imn&iacute; orm nach bhfuil go leor m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ann anois ag a bhfuil l&iacute;ofacht na Gaeilge leis an teanga a mh&uacute;ineadh i gceart.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; ruda&iacute; an-mhaith ag tarl&uacute;. T&aacute; Fiontar ann i DCU agus is f&eacute;idir c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al a fhoghlaim ansin. T&aacute; ruda&iacute; ar si&uacute;l ag daoine ar n&oacute;s Eoin &Oacute; Murch&uacute; leis an chl&aacute;r at&aacute; aige tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na Aoine ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta. An-chl&aacute;r at&aacute; ann. T&aacute; cl&aacute;racha d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar TG4 agus t&aacute; siad ar fheabhas.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n daoine f&aacute;gtha a scr&iacute;obhann litir mar an ceann a bh&iacute; in <i>The Irish Times</i> inniu &ldquo;Rather than engaging in tedious debate, English only speakers who are unable and are unwilling to communicate in Irish with Irish speakers, and who literally do not know what they are talking about, should mind their own business in this matter. It would allow others to have a fruitful discussion.&rdquo; In ainm D&eacute; t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach m&oacute;r&aacute;n daoine mar sin f&aacute;gtha. T&aacute; an seans c&eacute;anna againn nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar &aacute;r dtoil againn tuairim a bheith againn i leith na Gaeilge agus at&aacute; ag daoine cos&uacute;il leis.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm seans a fh&aacute;il labhairt f&aacute;n&aacute;r dteanga d&uacute;chais. N&iacute;l aon rud n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; i gcult&uacute;r t&iacute;re na teanga. Is droichead &iacute; <Col N="1279"/>idir r&eacute; at&aacute; thart agus an l&aacute; inniu. C&oacute;na&iacute;onn &aacute;r sinsir i dteanga. Sa nGaeilge, t&aacute; n&oacute;sanna, creideamh agus cur s&iacute;os ar an s&oacute;rt saoil a bh&iacute; ag &aacute;r sinsir le f&aacute;il. Lasmuigh den teanga, n&iacute;l sin ann. D&uacute;irt an Piarsach, &ldquo;Gan teanga, gan t&iacute;r&rdquo;. M&aacute;s f&iacute;or sin, t&aacute; orainn mar pholaiteoir&iacute; c&uacute;ram ceart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge ann. Nuair a th&aacute;inig na Gaill go dt&iacute; an t&iacute;r seo, thuig siad c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus a bh&iacute; teanga agus, nuair ba mhian leo meon na ndaoine a mhar&uacute; agus an rud faoi leith againn mar &Eacute;ireannaigh a scrios&uacute; an ch&eacute;ad iarracht a rinne siad n&aacute; an teanga a mhar&uacute;. Is cuimhin liom an t-amhr&aacute;n &ldquo;the women in the uplands digging praties speak a language that the strangers do not know&rdquo;. Chomh fada is nach raibh na Gaill in ann &aacute;r dteanga a labhairt, ba str&aacute;ins&eacute;ir&iacute; iad, ach thuig siad sin go r&iacute;-mhaith agus rinne siad tr&eacute;an iarracht an teanga a mhar&uacute; ach n&iacute;or &eacute;irigh leo. &Oacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil siad ann anois, &aacute;fach, t&aacute; an-seans ann go mar&oacute;imid f&eacute;in an teanga.</P>
      <P>Braitheann aitheantas n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ar teanga, n&oacute; fi&uacute; ar chan&uacute;int &aacute;iti&uacute;il. Is f&eacute;idir labhairt faoi chan&uacute;int na Mumhan n&oacute; Conamara. T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair liom can&uacute;int Th&iacute;r Chonaill a thuigbhe&aacute;il toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; chomh scioptha sin. Ach n&iacute;l a leith&eacute;id de rud agus can&uacute;int Loch Garmain ann. Is minic a bh&iacute;m ag caint le muintir Dh&uacute;n na nGall. Labhra&iacute;onn siad go han scioptha ach sin an t-aitheantas aiti&uacute;il at&aacute; acu-san. T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go gcoime&aacute;dfaimid an t-aitheantas speisialta sin d&aacute;r bp&aacute;ist&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Chun c&uacute;is na teanga a chur chun cinn caithfimid a bheith br&oacute;d&uacute;il aisti. D&eacute;anann m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; s&aacute;r-obair ar son na Gaeilge. Fuair m&eacute; mo ghr&aacute; f&eacute;in don nGaeilge &oacute; mh&uacute;inteoir a bh&iacute; agam sa mhe&aacute;nscoil, Miche&aacute;l T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, athair an scr&iacute;bhneora, Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n. Mar sin fein, bh&iacute; rud &eacute;igin m&iacute;cheart maidir le m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge; agus bh&iacute; mise p&aacute;irteach i m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge le fada. T&aacute; iar-mhic l&eacute;inn ar fud na t&iacute;re gur fuath leo an Ghaeilge toisc go raibh rud &eacute;igin m&iacute;cheart lena m&uacute;ineadh. T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfadh an Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta agus an Teach seo m&oacute;dhanna m&uacute;inte nua a scr&uacute;d&uacute;.</P>
      <P>Is annamh a aonta&iacute;onn gach Teachta sa D&aacute;il lena gc&eacute;ile ach t&aacute;imid ar aon aigne mar gheall ar th&aacute;bhacht na Gaeilge.</P>

	<P>Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Teacht &Oacute; D&iacute;omsaigh ag caint faoin difir idir na can&uacute;int&iacute;, th&aacute;inig sc&eacute;al isteach i m&rsquo;intinn. B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go dtuigfidh an Teachta D&oacute;nal &Oacute; Muimhneach&aacute;n cad &eacute; at&aacute; i gceist. I dT&iacute;r Chonail b&iacute;mid ag caint ar na huibheacha ach i gc&uacute;ige Mumhan deir siad hu&iacute;bhe. Deirtear go ndeachaigh fear as Ciarra&iacute; go D&uacute;n na nGall le c&uacute; a cheannacht. Ar nd&oacute;igh, bh&iacute; c&uacute; an-mhaith ag fear Dh&uacute;n na nGall agus rinne siad an margadh. Nuair a bh&iacute; an margadh d&eacute;anta agus an t-airgead d&iacute;olta arsa fear Chiarra&iacute; le fear Dh&uacute;n na nGall, &ldquo;An itheann s&eacute; na hu&iacute;bhe?&rdquo; Arsa fear Dh&uacute;n na nGall, &ldquo;Itheann s&eacute; ina shu&iacute; n&oacute; ina sheasamh&rdquo;. <Col N="1280"/>Tuigimid uilig an ciall anois. Tuigim muintir Chiarra&iacute;; chaith m&eacute; cupla bliain i gCorcaigh agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur sin an f&aacute;th.</P>
      <P>Rud maith &eacute; go mbeadh deis againn d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar an nGaeilge le linn Seachtain na Gaeilge. Is rud maith Seachtain na Gaeilge ar dh&oacute;igh amh&aacute;in. Ach, mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, is m&oacute;r an trua nach mbeadh deis againn Gaeilge a labhairt go rialta ins an Teach taobh amuigh de Sheachtain na Gaeilge. Bh&iacute; mise mar Bhall den Teach seo i 1986 nuair a bh&iacute; L&aacute; na Gaeilge againn. Ba &eacute; an Teachta Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe a bh&iacute; ina Aire St&aacute;it agus c&uacute;ram an tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; air ag an am. T&aacute;imid uilig ar aon intinn go dtugann d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht den chine&aacute;l seo deis duinn breathn&uacute; siar ag ch&uacute;is na Gaeilge agus breathn&uacute; chun tosaigh chomh maith. T&aacute; comhartha&iacute; d&oacute;chais agus comhartha&iacute; &eacute;ad&oacute;chais le feice&aacute;il chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an nGaeilge.</P>
      <P>Is cinnte go bhfuil comhartha&iacute; d&oacute;chais le feice&aacute;il. T&aacute; tagairt d&eacute;anta cheana f&eacute;in ag Teachta&iacute; &oacute; gach taobh den Teach dos na Gaelscoltacha, an comhartha d&oacute;chais is m&oacute;. Deirtear liom gur fhreastail 30,000 dalta ar Ghaelscoltacha ar fud na t&iacute;re, agus is maith an rud &eacute; sin. Nuair a bh&eacute;as an c&uacute;rsa bunoideachais d&eacute;anta acu, t&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go mbeidh siad l&iacute;ofa i dteanga na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Teachta &Oacute; Ciardha. T&aacute; comhartha&iacute; &eacute;ad&oacute;chais ins an bhunoideachais chomh maith. N&iacute;l seasamh na Gaeilge chomh laidir, chomh daingean n&aacute; chomh t&eacute;agartha ins na gn&aacute;th bhunscoileanna n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ins na blianta a chuaigh thart. T&aacute; roinnt c&uacute;iseanna leis sin. N&iacute;l an bh&eacute;im ch&eacute;anna ar l&iacute;ofacht a bheith ag na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;. Muna bhfuil s&eacute; ag na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; is deacair &eacute; a chur trasna chuig na p&aacute;ist&iacute;. Nil &eacute;inne a phiocann suas n&iacute;os tap&uacute;la n&aacute; na dalta&iacute; dearcadh an mh&uacute;inteora. Is bun-phrionsabal &eacute; sin a bhaineann le gach &aacute;bhar agus is cinnte go mbaineann s&eacute; leis an nGaeilge chomh maith.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; tagairt d&eacute;anta do Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus do TG4. Tugann sin seasamh agus st&aacute;das don nGaeilge nach raibh againn go dt&iacute; seo. T&aacute; Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta molta agus thar a bheith molta ach ceann des na ruda&iacute; a chaithfidh an d&aacute; st&aacute;isi&uacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; ard-chaighde&aacute;n Gaeilge a chur i l&aacute;thair mhuintir na t&iacute;re. D&iacute;reach mar a rinne an BBC leis in mB&eacute;arla ba ch&oacute;ir go nd&eacute;anfadh Raid&oacute; na Gaeltachta leis an nGaeilge. B&iacute;odh s&iacute; cruinn ceart agus b&iacute;odh gach aon duine at&aacute; ag iarraidh Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ag iarraigh an chaighde&aacute;in ch&eacute;anna a bhaint amach. Ar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; bhainfidh gach duine an caighde&aacute;n sin amach agus n&iacute;limid ag dr&eacute;im le go mbainfeadh, ach t&aacute; an-mheas ar iarracht a dh&eacute;anamh an caighde&aacute;n a bhaint amach. T&aacute; p&aacute;ip&eacute;ar nuachta laeth&uacute;il agus p&aacute;ip&eacute;ar seachtaini&uacute;il againn agus t&aacute; go leor &aacute; scr&iacute;obh. Is iad san na comhartha&iacute; d&oacute;chais.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; comhartha&iacute; &eacute;ad&oacute;chais ann chomh maith. T&aacute; na comhartha&iacute; &eacute;ad&oacute;chais le feice&aacute;il ins an nGaeltacht. Mar shampla, t&aacute; an chuid is m&oacute; de bhunscoltacha na Gaeltachta ag teagasc gach <Col N="1281"/>&aacute;bhar, taobh amuigh den nGaeilge f&eacute;in, tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla. T&aacute; rud &eacute;igin m&iacute;cheart ansin. T&aacute; 30 bliain &oacute; shin bh&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; scoltachta Gaeltacht ag teagasc tr&iacute; Ghaeilge n&aacute; mar at&aacute; inniu. T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil i bhfad n&iacute;os l&uacute; des na scoltacha sa Ghaeltacht ag cur isteach ar sc&eacute;im na labhartha na Gaeilge inniu n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; deich mbliana n&oacute; 20 bliain &oacute; shin. T&aacute; c&uacute;l&uacute; ansin a gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt air agus rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh ina thaobh.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; ceangal m&oacute;r idir ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga. Muna gcuirtear c&oacute;ir&iacute;ocht ceart eacnama&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il do bhun&uacute; na Gaeltachta imeoidh siad agus beidh an teanga n&iacute;os laige. Le iad a choinne&aacute;il ansin caithfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le fosta&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta anseo. Ritheadh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus ceapadh coimisin&eacute;ir teanga. Casadh an coimisin&eacute;ir orm ag an deireadh seachtaine. Is c&eacute;im ar aghaidh mh&oacute;r &iacute; sin agus cuirimid uilig f&aacute;ilte roimhe sin. Ach, is &iacute; an eagla at&aacute; orm go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt isteach reachta&iacute;ocht de gach sort i nD&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir san Eorap amach anseo, ach nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag dul i gcionn ar an phobal chomh m&oacute;r agus a ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; a bheith. T&aacute; d&iacute;l&aacute;r&uacute; ar si&uacute;l i dT&iacute;r Chonaill anois maidir le c&uacute;sa&iacute; chomhairle chondae. T&aacute; an comhairle condae tar &eacute;is bogadh go dt&iacute; an Chloch&aacute;n Liath chun freastal ar an Ghaeltacht. &Oacute; foscla&iacute;odh an oifig sin an samhradh seo caite cuireadh 20,000 glaoch isteach ann &oacute;n cheantar Gaeltachta sin agus bh&iacute; 1,700 acu i nGaeilge. Mar sin, caithfimid cur ina lu&iacute; ar an phobal go bhfaighidh siad seirbh&iacute;s chomh maith ins an Ghaeilge agus at&aacute; le f&aacute;il ins an Bh&eacute;arla. T&aacute; jab m&oacute;r le d&eacute;anamh ansin. T&aacute; pleananna ag an Aire anois feachtas poibl&iacute;ochta a chur ar f&aacute;il agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go gcuideodh s&eacute; sin. Is m&oacute; an trua go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht agus an coimisin&eacute;ir in &aacute;it ach nach bhfuil an pobal ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge chomh maith agus ab fh&eacute;idir. N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag cur locht ar an phobal. Ins na blianta a chuaigh thart bh&iacute; an dearcadh ansin nach raibh cothrom na F&eacute;inne le f&aacute;il &oacute;n seirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; muna nd&eacute;anf&aacute; do ghnoithe i mB&eacute;arla. Caithfimid-ne cur in i&uacute;l don phobal, agus do phobal na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil an caighde&aacute;n c&eacute;anna seirbh&iacute;se le f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus at&aacute; le f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla. Sin an f&aacute;th a thug m&eacute; an sampla sin de &uacute;s&aacute;id na hoifige i gceantar Gaeltachta. N&iacute;l a fhios agam cad &eacute; mar at&aacute; cursa&iacute; i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe, a bhfuil an tAire f&eacute;in lonnaithe ann, n&oacute; i nGaeltacht na Mumhan, ach is cinnte go bhfuil jab m&oacute;r le d&eacute;anamh.</P>
      <P>Mar sin de, t&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm deis a bheith agam cupla focal a r&aacute; o&iacute;che mar seo. Bh&iacute; muid aontaithe c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin nuair a bh&iacute; st&aacute;das na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach &aacute; phl&eacute; againn agus aontaithe faoin choiminis&eacute;ar so t&aacute; dea-mh&eacute;in agus dea-thoil anseo.</P>
      <P>I gceann dh&aacute; seachtaine, ba mhaith liom go mbeimid in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt sa D&aacute;il. Molaim an tAire as an smaointi&uacute; a bh&iacute; aige faoi chl&aacute;r &ldquo;An tSeachtain san Oireachtas&rdquo; ar TG4. D&aacute; mbeadh sin ann, is cinnte go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; <Col N="1282"/>daoine istigh anseo ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;id as an nGaeilge. Nuair a labharaim i nGaeilge, t&aacute; a fhios agam nach gcluinfear focal ina thaobh taobh amuigh den Teach. B&iacute;onn cl&aacute;r ar an teilif&iacute;s tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na Domhnaigh agus taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt anseo agus &aacute;iteanna eile, is f&eacute;idir f&oacute;theidil a chur air agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ind&eacute;anta. Sin smaointi&uacute; iontach maith agus m&aacute; chuirfear sin i bhfeidhm ar TG4, beidh s&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la. M&aacute; chifidh muintir na t&iacute;re agus na Gaeltactha go bhfuil ceannair&iacute; an phobail agus an Rialtais s&aacute;sta &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an Ghaeilge agus sinn ag caint faoi ruda&iacute; nach mbaineann fi&uacute; leis an Ghaeltacht, beidh obair mhaith d&eacute;anta.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go geal le Seachtain na Gaeilge agus ba mhaith liom gur rud lean&uacute;nach a bheidh ann sna laetha amach romhainn.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Hanafin. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar si&uacute;l anocht, mar a bh&iacute; seachtain &oacute; shin. T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an Ghaelainn &aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id anseo. Is &iacute; an Ghaelainn teanga d&uacute;chais is againne agus an teanga is aosta san Eoraip. Sin rud n&aacute;r thuigeamar f&eacute;in agus n&aacute;r cheap m&eacute; f&eacute;in, ach d&uacute;irt duine &eacute; liom le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus ba cheart go mb&eacute;adh muid m&oacute;r&aacute;lach as sin. Teanga faoi bhr&uacute; at&aacute; ann, gan dabht, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil baol go gcaillfear an teanga muna coimh&eacute;adaimid &iacute;. Is cailli&uacute;nt d&rsquo;aon t&iacute;r a teanga d&uacute;chais a chailli&uacute;nt. T&aacute; tr&eacute;ith&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la in achan teanga agus is t&iacute;r gan anam t&iacute;r gan teanga. T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-shoil&eacute;ir agus t&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite le fada an l&aacute;. T&aacute; an teanga riachtanach d&aacute;r gcult&uacute;r, neamhsple&aacute;chas agus aitheantas. Aon teanga nach bhfuil &aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id go hoifigi&uacute;il, t&aacute; cont&uacute;irt ann go gcaillf&iacute; ar fad &iacute;.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin nuair a th&aacute;inig m&eacute; amach as an scoil, n&iacute;or labhair muid ach Gaeilge agus nuair a chuaigh m&eacute; a bhaile, labhair gach duine Gaeilge sa teach. Th&aacute;inig s&eacute; go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha d&uacute;inn. Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar scoil, cuireadh br&uacute; orainn B&eacute;arla a labhairt agus nuair a bheimis amach ag imirt ag an scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta bheadh cuid de na leana&iacute; a bheadh ag labhairt Gaeilge sa bhaile agus ag labhairt c&uacute;pla focal B&eacute;arla nuair a chuaigh siad isteach sa scoil. T&aacute; eagla orm gur an rud a tharla le roinnt blianta anuas go bhfuil an r&aacute;iteas casadh beag&aacute;n r&oacute;fhada nach bhfuil an oiread sin daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge anois agus mar a bh&iacute;.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; an-obair d&eacute;anta ag an Aire don nGaelainn agus do na Gaeltachta&iacute; &oacute;na ceapadh mar Aire &eacute;. T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&eacute;anta aige n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; d&eacute;anta ag na hAir&iacute; Gaeltachta roimhe go l&eacute;ir le ch&eacute;ile. T&aacute; an t-airgead &aacute; chur isteach sna Gaeltachta&iacute; agus postanna curtha ar f&aacute;il agus ba cheart go mbeimis m&oacute;r&aacute;lach don Aire mar is f&eacute;idir linn seasamh in aon Ghaeltacht agus a r&aacute; gurbh &eacute; an Aire a chuir an t-airgead isteach ann agus na postanna ar f&aacute;il. Sin sl&iacute; amh&aacute;in an teanga a choimhe&aacute;d beo.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; gach iarracht a dh&eacute;anamh ag an Rialtas ar son na teanga.

Nuair a fh&eacute;achaim-se ar leabhr&aacute;in &oacute;n Welsh Language Board, mar shampla, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an m&oacute;dh oibre i dt&iacute;ortha eile an-dhifri&uacute;il. B&iacute;onn an Bhreatnais agus an B&eacute;arla taobh le taobh i ngach aon &aacute;it a fh&eacute;achann t&uacute;. Is rud t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important subject and am glad the Minister for Health and Children is present to hear my concerns again.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Last June, through parliamentary questions and on the Adjournment debate, I raised concerns about the threat to surgical services at Cavan General Hospital. I expressed particular concern about the threatened withdrawal by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland of recognition of five surgical trainee posts in the hospital. The Minister for Health and Children was requested last August by the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board to establish an inquiry following the suspension of two consultant surgeons.</P>
        <P>I secured another Adjournment debate in early February on the difficulties facing the surgical department at Cavan General Hospital. It has been stated repeatedly that the suspensions arose from interpersonal difficulties between two eminent surgeons in the department. I outlined in the debate and elsewhere that those interpersonal difficulties should have been dealt with firmly and in good time by the senior management of the health board. Unfortunately, the health board was lacking in such firm management and necessary human resource management. Health board management failed to address serious emerging difficulties and the subsequent inquiry has been much too slow.</P>
        <P>Over the years I regularly met people who outlined their great satisfaction with the work and expertise of consultant surgeons attached to Cavan General Hospital. I also acknowledge the excellent work done and treatment provided in the medical department and in the gynaecology and obstetrics unit. The personnel attached to the hospital in all disciplines are rightly held in high esteem by the communities of Cavan-Monaghan, north Longford, south Leitrim and north Meath and people appreciate their commitment, professionalism and dedication to duty.</P><Miles com="cl" par="105"/>
        <P>Unfortunately, a number of outcomes following surgical procedures or medical treatment give rise to legitimate grievance and mourning for families and, sadly, no way back for the patient. Previously, by way of parliamentary question, I raised with the Minister the need to <Col N="1287"/>involve the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, in advancing and extending the work of the surgical department in the hospital. I was glad to learn that the North Eastern Health Board has sought the advice of the RCSI and is working closely with the college in this regard. I am also glad the Minister met the medical board of the hospital some time ago and I hope the proposals tabled at the meeting can be advanced.</P>
        <P>This matter also relates to additional resources for the surgical department. An additional consultant surgeon is needed and I request the Minister to make such an appointment as quickly as possible. The people of Cavan believe that the surgical department of the general hospital has the potential to deliver an excellent service to its catchment area. Leadership and support for the department is necessary to achieve that outcome. There should be improved co-operation and exchange of personnel between the two surgical departments at Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.</P>
        <P>A hospital the size of Cavan General Hospital should have special links with one of the large teaching hospitals in Dublin such as the Mater Hospital or Beaumont Hospital. Such links could be used for exchange of staff and other necessary support, especially when difficulties or pressures might emerge. The suggestion should be explored.</P>
        <P>The health board, in recently reviewing a limited number of surgical cases, should have called on the expertise of a professional from another health board area. If the next of kin in the cases under review have concerns about the treatment of relatives, they should be treated with the utmost consideration and an independent review of such cases should be undertaken without delay. I hope the Minister can impress upon the health board the need for such consideration and I thank him for his efforts and commitment to date in dealing with these difficult issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no pleasure for me to raise the problem relating to the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group again. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me do so and I thank the Minister for coming to the House at this late hour to listen to the contributions of both myself and Deputy Brendan Smith. He and I are often on different sides on issues but we share similar views on this matter. We both want the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group to work properly.</P>
        <P>Much of what is happening in the hospitals must be addressed by the management of the hospital and the North Eastern Health Board. Two eminent surgeons were allowed to sustain a personal dispute for ages. The dogs on the street knew about it, yet the dispute was not dealt with by senior personnel. Dunnes Stores, Tesco or other businesses could not be run that way. The issue has been left in the Minister&rsquo;s lap and he has had problems addressing it. This dispute is the source of the problem at Cavan General Hospital as locum and other short-term appointments had to be made. Ultimately, surgeons in whom people can build trust need to <Col N="1288"/>be appointed or re-appointed on a permanent basis.</P>
        <P>A shiver went down the spines of the people of Cavan-Monaghan last Thursday when the report on hospital services was highlighted by the media. In addition, Frances Sheridan, aged nine, passed away tragically recently. I visited her home together with our local councillor, Aidan Boyle, and we saw her lying in her coffin wearing her first communion dress. She was the star of the Christmas variety show and, while she was sick, she asked for her lessons to be sent home so that she could keep up with her work.</P>
        <P>An environment of trust must be created. It was not acceptable to the people of Cavan-Monaghan that Mr. Finbarr Lennon, an eminent surgeon in Drogheda hospital, was brought in to conduct an inquiry in Cavan. He is not seen as an independent person. His report makes sad reading. It is even more difficult to understand that he should suggest the way around this problem is to provide extra staff in Drogheda. How would people go from Cavan to Drogheda in an emergency? Surely the experts should be appointed to Cavan General Hospital. As a layman, the way I see the problem being solved is to ensure that appointments are made to Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital is brought back on call. There is no reason that goodwill cannot exist between the two hospitals. If Cavan and Monaghan hospitals were set up as a joint hospital project by the health board, surely it would be under a single manager and it should be possible to send staff from one hospital to the other.</P>
        <P>An aged person had to be moved from Monaghan General Hospital to Drogheda, when a surgeon was available, but all that was needed was an anaesthetist. I do not want to be critical for the sake of it, but the crisis has to be dealt with urgently. I do not mind whose head rolls, whether the hospital or health board management, but it certainly should not be that of the patients in Cavan and Monaghan hospitals. The patients must come first. I know the Minister will have a prepared script, but I hope he has listened carefully to the points raised by Deputy Brendan Smith and me. We both speak in sincerity when we say we want a proper service.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Smith and Crawford for raising this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>This has been a very difficult time for the people of the Cavan-Monaghan area and in particular their, public representatives and the staff at the hospital.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a difficult time for the hospital community. I reiterate my profound sympathy to the Sheridan family on their tragic loss, which we discussed in this House last week.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the House on the various issues raised by Deputies Smith and Crawford regarding surgical services at <Col N="1289"/>Cavan General Hospital. At the outset, responsibility for the provision of services at Cavan General Hospital rests with the North Eastern Health Board. In this regard, I met earlier today the chief executive of the board and the board&rsquo;s medical adviser to discuss the position at Cavan General Hospital and, in particular, the findings and recommendations in Mr. Lennon&rsquo;s recent report to the board. I was assured by the board that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure the provision of a high quality, accessible and safe service to the people of Cavan and Monaghan. I will deal later with specific elements of the board&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>Following the introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme in July 2002, all health care organisations are required to have in place systems to collect information on clinical incidents and to report them to the clinical indemnity scheme.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the North Eastern Health Board introduced an integrated incident reporting system based on international best practice. This is a very positive development as it is through the willingness of staff to report incidents that an organisation can build systems of high quality and safety.</P>
        <P>Approximately 26,000 incidents were reported nationally in 2003. In the north-eastern region, 2,500 incidents were reported in the Louth-Meath hospital group and 750 were reported in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. Of these 750 incidents, the board&rsquo;s risk adviser recommended that the views of a consultant be obtained in 15 cases treated in the surgery department in Cavan General Hospital. Accordingly, the board&rsquo;s medical adviser was requested to carry out a review in this regard.</P>
        <P>On 4 March 2004, the North Eastern Health Board published the medical adviser&rsquo;s report which contained a number of recommendations with regard to surgical services at the hospital. My Department is informed that Mr. Lennon has met the relevant medical and executive staff at the hospital to discuss his recommendations, as well as those made by Professor Tanner, director of surgical affairs at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, who has been advising the board on the configuration of surgical services at the hospital. Arising from these discussions, I understand that agreement has been reached on a number of key issues, namely, that Professor Tanner&rsquo;s proposals on the general and surgical audit will be implemented. This will involve regular audit meetings held by the department of surgery and a monthly review of the process, involving Mr. Lennon. This is absolutely essential in terms of instilling confidence in the surgical department and I am glad to see Professor Tanner&rsquo;s proposals being taken on board and that the surgeons, Professor Tanner and Mr. Lennon are engaged in constructive dialogue.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Smith&rsquo;s request for additional resources, I will be supportive of any plans by the North Eastern Health Board to put procedures in place to increase the volume of appropriate elective surgery at Cavan General Hospital. At today&rsquo;s meeting we impressed the <Col N="1290"/>need for a management system and so on at Cavan-Monaghan hospitals, to respond to Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s point. As a result of my meeting today, I am assured of the board&rsquo;s confidence, that as a result of the implementation of these recommendations at the hospital, emergency on-call surgical services will continue to be provided at Cavan General Hospital. In this regard the board held interviews today for the recruitment of a fourth surgeon to Cavan General Hospital and is confident that an early appointment will be made to augment the existing surgical complement at the hospital.</P>
        <P>I have asked the board to be proactive in looking at the permanent staffing position and to take appropriate steps in that regard. That would have some resource implications, a point raised by Deputy Smith. I am anxious to be supportive of the board in its endeavour to deliver a resolution to these issues in the Cavan-Monaghan context, with synergies between both sites and people working together, as has been said. I am anxious to see that happening here.</P>
        <P>The board has stressed that it is committed to ensuring there is a joint approach to the provision of hospital services across the Cavan-Monaghan group and is actively working to ensure agreement on this issue on both sides. I wish the board every success in that regard. I ask all parties to these discussions to work together to bring about a comprehensive package that will lead to a new era for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I will continue to liaise with the board on developments in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the cases which were reviewed by Mr. Lennon, the Department is advised by the board that it will offer an independent review of the care and treatment to the next of kin of any of the patients whose cases were reviewed, who have concerns about the treatment of a relative at Cavan General Hospital. Let me stress again that it will be independent of the board and I have been informed by the board that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland will have a role to play in nominating such an independent person from outside the board&rsquo;s area.</P>
        <P>The issues raised on the provision of services at Cavan General Hospital are being addressed as a priority by the North Eastern Health Board with a view to ensuring the provision of a comprehensive and safe range of services across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I will continue to liaise with the board on the implementation of the various recommendations put forward to effect the delivery of an appropriate range of services on a group basis to the population of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. Mr. Seamus Birrane has been waiting to be called for an orthopaedic appointment for the past two and a half years. He was seen by Mr. Prasad, locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon, on 4 December 2003. Mr. Prasad had classed him as a &ldquo;very urgent&rdquo; case. I have written to Mr. Devitt who is the new orthopaedic surgeon in Merlin Park <Col N="1291"/>hospital, Galway, stressing the urgency of the situation.</P>
        <P>Mr. Birrane is in constant pain, in spite of pain killing medication. He cannot get around and is confined to a chair. He cannot tie his shoelaces without help. He is in pain all the time and has no quality of life. He sleeps very little because of this pain. I feel strongly that it is not acceptable that he should be left any longer without the treatment he requires, namely, hip operations. One hip is as bad as the other and the question is which hip will be done first. He had a massive heart attack some years ago, which he survived, and he deserves a quality of life that he does not have at the moment. He is 70 years of age and he is crippled. He deserves to spend his golden years with his wife and free from pain. He is incapacitated. He has a car and it is unsafe for him to drive in his current condition. Both his hips must be replaced which is why it is imperative to begin the process as soon as possible. He has lost his quality of life, freedom, mobility and peace of mind. He is never free from pain. He deserves better. It is a scandal that he is in this situation.</P>
        <P>In the Western Health Board area people must wait four years to be seen. The situation of the man in question is not unique for there are thousands waiting. I became involved in politics through a campaign I began some years ago to establish an orthopaedic unit. People in Mayo had to travel the almost the same distance for services as it is from here to Galway. Older people who break their hips continue to die due to the terrible distance involved. It is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>While an orthopaedic unit has been put in place and one consultant has been appointed, only trauma services are available. In Mayo we have an intensive care unit and the facilities to perform hip replacement operations, but the unit is not geared up. A request has been made for staff, but only two thirds of the staffing numbers asked for have been approved. We need a full complement of radiologists at Mayo General Hospital and adequate laboratory staff for transfusion. These are essential parts of the chain which must be put in place to ensure the service can be complete. If the hospital is not fully resourced, it cannot carry out the work it needs to do. There is a great need for this work. Mr. Birrane&rsquo;s circumstances are neither unique nor acceptable. It makes me sad. What is life about if the health service fails to cope with people who have a need like this?</P>
        <P>I met Mr. Birrane and his family and I was disgusted that he could be left to wait for so long. What kind of health service do we have if this is the result? An orthopaedic unit comprising a ward and theatre has lain idle in Mayo for two years. While it is supposed to begin to operate, the Department has failed to provide the resources needed to ensure that the unit can function adequately to perform necessary hip replacements. Why should people have to travel to Merlin Park? It would be much more <Col N="1292"/>appropriate to carry out their operations at Mayo General Hospital which has an intensive care unit.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister examine the cases of people like Mr. Birrane and ensure the resources are put in place to provide a proper orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital? We deserve no less.</P>

	<P>I remind Deputy Cowley that the provision of health services for people who live in County Mayo is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. It is not normal practice to discuss the circumstance&rsquo;s of an individual patient&rsquo;s case in the House.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should let me finish. I did not interrupt him. I just want to explain.</P>
        <P>We have made inquiries of the Western Health Board about the case referred to by the Deputy. The board has advised me that it is hoped to call the patient for surgery over the next six to eight weeks. While I do not know the details of the individual case, I am curious as to why he has spent two and a half years waiting. The national treatment purchase fund has been up and running for well over a year to deal with cases in which the wait is longer than 12 months. We have placed advertisements in newspapers and asked health boards to forward details of patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about someone who is on a waiting list for a hip replacement operation. Through the national treatment purchase fund, 11,000 people have been treated who were waiting longer than 12 months for various operations in various specialities. We have advertised the phone number and informed general practitioners and health boards of the scheme. To be fair to Deputy Cowley, he has described the difficult circumstances of the gentleman in question. He should not be in the situation the Deputy outlined. A reason the treatment purchase fund was introduced was to deal with public patients</P>

	<P>The waiting time has gone down to six months in most health board areas. Anyone waiting longer than six months on a public hospital waiting list can now be attended to via the treatment purchase fund. If any Deputy knows of any other case in which someone who has been seen by a consultant and recommended for orthopaedic surgery remains on a waiting list for this long, I urge him or her to contact the <Col N="1293"/><?oasys _fc?>treatment purchase fund and advise it of the details.</P>

	<P>I am talking about the case before us. The case of this man has already been assessed and an operation has been recommended. I am simply saying that the facility of the national treatment purchase fund was available to that patient.</P>
        <P>Orthopaedic services in the west are provided at regional hospitals in Galway, including Merlin Park to which the Deputy referred. To develop regional orthopaedic services in the west, the Government has provided for a new orthopaedic trauma ward and theatres at University College Hospital, Galway. The development has recently been completed as part of the second phase of the major capital development on the hospital site which cost more than &euro;100 million. The transformation of the hospital into a major regional centre is a demonstration of the great commitment of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to the west. The people of the west will no longer have to travel to Dublin for many services.</P>
        <P>A new orthopaedic unit has been built at Mayo General Hospital as part of the more recent &euro;48 million investment in the infrastructure at the hospital. Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies in Mayo deserve some credit for lobbying intensively for the unit. While Deputy Cowley has had his interest in the project, public representatives in the west from all parties have had an interest as well. It fell to the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government with the Progressive Democrats to make major investment in the infrastructure at Mayo General Hospital. When the service is up and running, it will bring orthopaedic services to Mayo General Hospital for the first time and will operate with the regional orthopaedic service to serve the people of Mayo. A new consultant orthopaedic surgeon has recently taken up his appointment at the hospital.</P>
        <P>We provided the Revenue funding for this unit some years back but, for some reason, the board was not in a position to start it up. My officials have had discussions this year with the board which has indicated that, in the context of the 2004 service plan, the Revenue funding will be provided for the roll-out of orthopaedic services.</P>

	<P>That will only happen if the necessary funding is provided. I hope the Minister will ensure it is.</P>

      <sTitle>Security of the Elderly.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme of community supports for older people, which was first introduced in 1996, is important, especially to those who feel vulnerable and isolated or who have been victims of crime. While the scheme has been successful in assisting thousands of older people, its rules and regulations must be reviewed with a view to meeting the needs of the elderly and ensuring transparency in its commercial aspects.</P>
        <P>One of the scheme&rsquo;s most significant flaws is the limited time available for applications and the fact that people never know the day or the month they may become widowed, ill or a victim of an attack. A mechanism must be found to address such a scenario at any time during the calendar year. The fact that thousands of vulnerable people are unaware of the scheme is a matter of further concern. Even if they are aware of it, there is not always a functional voluntary group available to complete the application form. These shortcomings must be addressed as the care of the elderly must continue to be the scheme&rsquo;s priority.</P>
        <P>I have received representations from a number of small and medium-sized companies in the security alarms businesses who have alleged that the tendering process for the work has been taken over systematically by at least one commercial group which uses community-based organisations as a cover to breach the scheme&rsquo;s guidelines. This is done with a view to becoming the dominant supplier and installer. Having investigated the matter, I am satisfied that the scheme is open to abuse and being abused. Applications to the scheme are invited from locally-based organisations which apply on behalf of older people. Ultimately, these organisations will seek quotes and choose the security equipment they consider best. While I fully subscribe to this, the scheme must be transparent and there must be a level playing pitch for all suppliers. This is not currently the case. A multinational company, Tunstall Group UK, has secured the business of the most significant and largest of the successful applicants at the expense of other, mostly Irish, companies.</P>
        <P>How has this occurred? There is a link between Security of the Elderly, which applied for more than 1,000 people this year, Emergency Response and Tunstall Group Limited. I have seen a letter, dated 13 August 2003 that outlines the position. It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">This grant is given on a yearly basis and can only be applied for by a group rather than individuals, e.g. Homehelp, Community Care and Neighbourhood Watch groups. [The letter then refers to difficulties regarding extra paperwork etc.] I, on behalf of Emergency Response can now offer to take on this paperwork for the individual groups and assist them in applying for the people in their area who need the added security of having a monitored alarm.</P>
        <P FLI="0">They are carrying out work on behalf of voluntary groups.</P><Col N="1295"/>
        <P>I have another document that states: &ldquo;Emergency Response merges with leading global provider. Tunstall Group Ltd., Europe&rsquo;s leading provider of personal home reassurance systems acquired Emergency Response Ltd. on the 5th of June 2001.&rdquo; The managing director of Emergency Response said: &ldquo;We have been working with Tunstall for several years and it was a natural evolution to become part of the Tunstall Group.&rdquo; Here we have the link between those organisations that are applying for a group but are not supposed to be doing so under the scheme. I have received correspondence from a security company in the south. It strongly stated that a foreign multinational now has control of the majority of this business, continues to aggressively ignore the laws and guidelines that bind other companies and seems to do as it pleases with the apparent blessing of the Department.</P>
        <P>I want an improved scheme for the elderly. I want the scheme to be fair and transparent for all concerned; nothing less is acceptable. I ask the Minister to take into account some of the issues I have raised before the new scheme is introduced later in the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The scheme was first introduced in 1996. It is now operated on an annual basis and was transferred to my Department in 2002. Approximately &euro;2.4 million has been allocated for this scheme this year.</P>
        <P>The scheme is advertised each year and applications are invited from local voluntary and community groups to apply on behalf of older people in their area. Money is provided for the groups and not for individuals. My Department assesses applications from these organisations. However, the applicant organisation is responsible for selecting the supplier and for the purchase and installation of the equipment. The Department has no role in this process. It is a requirement of the scheme that voluntary or community based groups seeking funding must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. Those eligible for assistance under the scheme are persons aged 65 and over who are living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and who are financially unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides funding for small-scale physical security equipment, such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains, door locks and security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems, <Col N="1296"/>such as the &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone. Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder alarms or smoke alarms. Under the terms of the scheme funding is available towards the once-off cost of obtaining or installing the relevant equipment. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially monitored alarm systems are not provided for under this scheme and as these are levied by private service providers, my Department has no role in setting them.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs, inclusive of VAT, associated with the purchase and-or installation of this type of equipment. However, the actual grant varies in light of individual circumstances and needs and takes account of the overall demands that must be met. In general, grants will cover between 50% and 90% of the total costs and applicants must show how the balance of funding will be obtained.</P>
        <P>My Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the regulations and requirements. An independent review of the scheme, completed in 1999, found that the security and social support of a large number of people had been greatly enhanced by the scheme. I do not think anyone doubts this and I understand that the Deputy is not suggesting this. It also noted that while the primary purpose of the scheme was to respond to the security threat to elderly people, it also had an important health and community care effect. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the scheme rules and guidelines prior to advertising the 2004 scheme in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Since I became Minister, with the Minister of State I have sought to examine these schemes to determine whether they are proofed against abuse. I am concerned to note that there has been a professionalisation of the voluntary and community sector in a number of areas. There are people who now see this as a vehicle for doing considerable business. I will take on board the concerns the Deputy has raised and ensure this matter is investigated. I will ensure there is a level and free playing pitch when we advertise the scheme again.</P>
        <P>When we spend public money, it is important that those at whom it is targeted derive the benefit. There must be proper competition and all companies, regardless of their size, should have a fair chance of tendering for this work. The community sector is now more developed than in 1996. We must look at the groups that are providing this service to ensure they are bona fide groups.</P>

	<P>My Department, supported by ADM Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for each of the other Departments to report progress on its implementation and details of funding for the proposals that fall within their remit.</P>
      <P>Plans have been prepared for each of the 45 RAPID areas and proposals have been forwarded by ADM Limited to relevant Departments for consideration. Proposals from 32 areas were relevant to my Department and their estimated is in the region of &euro;65 million.</P>
      <P>Proposals from RAPID plans relevant to my Department fall to be considered under the community development programme, funding for local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund. Details of allocations to specific proposals from RAPID plans that were relevant to my Department are as follows: &euro;1 million was allocated under the premises initiative to a local drugs task force project in Tallaght; and six new community development projects in RAPID areas received a renewable one year contract for funding of &euro;60,000 last year and projects in Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, Merchants Quay or Ushers Quay, Longford town and Tipperary were supported.</P>
      <P>Funding was awarded under my Department&rsquo;s once-off grants scheme to 14 specific projects from RAPID plans. They were as follows: &euro;13,500 to eight projects from the Clonmel RAPID plan; &euro;22,000 to a project from the Ennis RAPID plan; &euro;11,800 to four projects from the Kilkenny RAPID plan; and &euro;2,000 to a project from the Youghal RAPID plans.</P>
      <P>A large number of proposals from the plans fall to be considered under the YPFSF. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, hopes <Col N="1298"/>to announce the allocations in the near future. Since the establishment of the RAPID programme my Department has provided approximately &euro;3.5 million by way of support to the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans and administration costs associated with the support team in ADM.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 108, 109, 112, 120, 125, 128, 145, 170, 177 and 189 together.</P>
        <P>At present decisions on disbursement of funds from dormant accounts are a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board. It is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.</P>
        <P>The board is currently deciding on the disbursement of funds of up to &euro;30 million. To date it has approved 18 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;1.7 million. Approximately 500 applications have been received to date and they are being assessed on an ongoing basis by ADM on behalf of the board. The Government has not and will not be involved in decisions about these applications.</P>
        <P>In December 2003 the Government reviewed arrangements for dormant accounts. Three practical considerations for doing so are as follows: the board&rsquo;s organisational arrangements involve a handful of seconded civil servants in a secretariat role and are not designed to support disbursements on the scale now emerging; governance arrangements, including the legal requirement that a part-time chairman should be accountable for millions of euro, are inadequate; to ensure value for money the fund must be co-ordinated with priorities identified by Government and debated in this House.</P>
        <P>The Government does not consider that increasing the number of the board&rsquo;s administrative staff would adequately address the governance and policy issues arising. It believes that the objectives of the disbursements scheme, as set out in the board&rsquo;s first disbursement plan, should remain unchanged. In other words, funding to assist programmes or projects targeting the following three broad categories of persons: those affected by economic and social disadvantage; those affected by educational disadvantage; and persons with a disability.</P>
        <P>The plan was published in November 2003 and appropriate administrative supports were provided for its preparation by the board.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision of 18 December 2003 provides that decisions on disbursement of <Col N="1300"/>funds would be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process. Appropriate arrangements would be put in place so that spending from the fund would be clearly separate to the Estimates provision.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes key roles on advising, monitoring and planning in the area of dormant accounts for the board, with particular regard to the following: advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding; preparation of the disbursement plan; and reviewing, evaluating, and reporting on the effectiveness, additionality and impact of disbursements.</P>
        <P>This year draft legislation will be introduced with a view to giving effect to these decisions. I expect the legislation will be published over the coming months.</P>
        <P>A second transfer of funds from credit institutions, together with the first transfer of moneys from life assurance policies, will take place at the end of April 2004. At this stage I cannot estimate the likely yield from these sources in 2004 but the sum will become clearer at the end of April.</P>
        <P>Last December the Minister wrote to the board&rsquo;s chairman about an additional &euro;10 million for the rural social scheme and the board responded in writing. The process was undertaken in accordance with the terms of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, as amended. Arrangements for the scheme are currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>Under the disbursement plan a significant level of allocations from the fund are being targeted at programmes or projects within RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas. No proposals are currently envisaged to change the arrangement.</P>
        <P>I shall now answer the question about funding for initiatives such as the local development programme and the YPFSF. In 2004, under subhead L in my Department&rsquo;s Vote a sum of &euro;42.144 million was provided for local development and social inclusion measures. Last year&rsquo;s funding under the same subhead was &euro;44.662 million. A budget of &euro;1.5 million to support the implementation of the RAPID programme was included in the figure. This year the funding is &euro;5.8 million, including capital, and is reflected in a new separate subhead in the Department&rsquo;s Vote, subhead O2. Therefore, a comparison of both subheads is not appropriate.</P>
        <P>Funding for drugs initiatives in 2004 will not be reduced. The difference in provision &mdash; as outlined in the 2004 Revised Estimates &mdash; arises from the mainstreaming of successfully evaluated services projects from round I of the YPFSF. As many as 85 projects were positively evaluated and have been mainstreamed with effect from 1 January 2004. As a result &euro;6.705 million was transferred to other Votes. The Department of Education and Science received &euro;6.594 million and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform received &euro;0.111 million. They are now responsible for the continued funding of the projects in question. I intend to announce round II allocations under the fund in the very near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 143 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously that I am unhappy with certain aspects of the RAPID programme. I have examined the manner it operates and in the future it will operate on a number of levels in tandem.</P>
        <P>There are many small scale proposals from RAPID plans that have been sent unnecessarily to Departments for consideration. They could be dealt with more effectively at local level. I propose to introduce a new delivery mechanism to progress such actions. It will be supported by funding under a new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million in 2004. These projects will be co-funded by the relevant local agency under a number of categories with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.</P>
        <P>I have met my ministerial colleagues to discuss the details of the measures to be funded. I have kept my Cabinet colleagues up to date on the matter. I intend to make a formal announcement shortly regarding the precise details of the operation of the fund.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that Departments will continue to consider larger projects from RAPID plans for allocations from funding streams within each Department. I expect that Departments will deal with a smaller number of projects and will prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions.</P>
        <P>Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue. It is an important component of the programme. I am now the chairman of the programme&rsquo;s national monitoring committee.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments in disadvantaged rural areas. These measures support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects. They <Col N="1302"/>reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas with whom I consulted.</P>
        <P>The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas. I shall continue the practice for new measures, depending on needs identified. I shall also keep the operation of existing measures under review.</P>
        <P>The merits of the practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. Expenditure amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002 and &euro;8.613 million in 2003. It is estimated that these amounts levered out a further &euro;21 million in related public and private expenditure to areas that would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. The provision for 2004 is &euro;13.49 million. It will enable the continuation of investment under existing measures. The sum will also provide scope for the introduction of new measures as may be identified during the year.</P>
        <P>With the ongoing co-operation of other Departments, State agencies and public utilities, CL&Aacute;R will continue to deliver on the commitment of supporting rural communities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of an ongoing ministerial review of programmes aimed at tackling disadvantage. I outlined the position in my reply to Question No. 151 on 4 February. Since that date Area Development Management Limited, local and community development bodies and county and city development boards have been informed of the Government&rsquo;s decisions.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the 2004 provision of &euro;0.9 million under subhead A2 for the travel and subsistence expenses of my Department. The allocation represents an increase of 33% on the expenditure under the heading in 2003. However, it is a reduction on the amount initially provided for 2003.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the provision of &euro;0.9 million represents a more accurate assessment of my Department&rsquo;s requirements. The relatively low level of expenditure in 2003 reflected the period of settling down of the newly established Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Higher costs will arise this year from the greater level of interaction with the EU, especially in the context of the Irish Presidency and significant policy deliberations on territorial cohesion and rural development.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 192 and 436 together.</P>
        <P>I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation and the decline and lack of services in rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annually fund the programme and consideration of additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government agreed on additional areas and I announced them on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties are now included in the programme. There is no plan for a further review or more changes to the boundary of CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. They support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects.

        <P>The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate.

I shall also keep the operation of existing measures under review.</P><Col N="1305"/>
        <P>The merits of the practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. Expenditure amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002 and to &euro;8.613 million in 2003. It is estimated that these amounts levered out a further &euro;17 million in related public and private expenditure into areas that would not be prioritised for infrastructure investment. The provision for 2004 is &euro;13.49 million. This sum will enable the continuation of investment under existing measures. It will also provide scope for the introduction of further measures as may be identified during the year.</P>

	<P>The national drugs strategy 2001 to 2008 provides for the establishment of the ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, throughout the country. The RDTFs are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the range and level of existing services, with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. In this context, the Deputy should note that an amount of &euro;500,000 has been provided by my Department, in the current year, for administrative and technical assistance costs incurred by the RDTFs in the preparation of their plans.</P>
        <P>The work under way by the RDTFs is likely to take up most of the current year and will then feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be assessed by the national drugs strategy team in due course. I am hopeful that all this work can be completed by early 2005 and that I will then be in a position to bring recommendations regarding the funding of the plans to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. I expect the RDTFs to be in a position to begin the implementation of their plans by mid-2005.</P>

        <P>Having regard to such matters, it strikes me that Leader groups, and in Gaeltacht areas an alignment of such groups with &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta, may be well positioned to support the delivery of the programme locally. I anticipate that the necessary arrangements in relation to the scheme can be advanced over the next six to eight weeks and that the scheme itself can commence shortly thereafter.</P>

        <P>As Deputies will be aware, on 4 March last, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, published the consultation draft of guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing. These guidelines are vitally important in order that there is clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy on rural housing. They also reflect the view I have expressed in recent years. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to be complimented on the reasoned approach he has adopted on this issue, which also builds on Government policy as reflected in the national spatial strategy.</P>

While a sum of &euro;10.294 million had been provided in the 2003 Revised Estimates towards this programme, the actual expenditure in 2003 was &euro;11.95 million, which represented a 16% increase on the allocation provided. A total of &euro;9.975 million has been provided in the 2004 Revised Estimates, a reduction of 3.6% on the previous year&rsquo;s Estimate. I am satisfied that this allocation is sufficient, having regard to the fact that the local authorities managed to complete more work during 2003 than anticipated and that the agreed two-year programme is now ahead of schedule.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 137 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>In my reply to Questions Nos. 130 and 131 of 4 February 2004 I outlined the background and the qualifying criteria for the rural social scheme. I am currently preparing detailed proposals for Government on the scheme. It has been clear for some time that farming alone can no longer sustain rural populations. Rural dwellers, most of whom are no longer farmers, expect and demand a standard of living comparable with that of urban dwellers and will rightly settle for nothing less. Therefore, new ways must be found to address the needs of rural dwellers. I firmly believe that EU rural policy must take account of this reality.</P>
        <P>I made it clear in an address to the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development earlier this year that any new policy <Col N="1311"/>proposals must recognise that rural areas must have multidimensional development policies and that a total dependence on agriculture will not sustain the population in rural areas; contain clear spatial strategies, ensuring the continued maintenance and growth of rural populations; and target funding for rural areas to ensure<Miles com="jy"/>that infrastructure deficits in roads, telecommunications, water, public transport and so on do not inhibit rural growth. These funds in particular need to be targeted at declining and peripheral areas.</P>
        <P>The conclusion of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2003 gave the clearest possible signal from the European Union that rural development policy is central to the future development of an enlarged Community. The Commission has indicated that it will bring forward new proposals later this year for a new community rural development programme to commence under the next round of EU funding. I hope the Commission agrees with my views on future rural development policy and that the proposals will reflect strong support for a multidimensional, multifunctional rural economy. My Department will engage positively in any negotiations to ensure that the necessary rural community initiatives are adopted. In the meantime the Leader+ programme and the area-based rural development initiative, implemented by my Department and involving almost &euro;150 million of public funding, continue to perform an invaluable function in empowering rural communities and priming the rural economy in every region and county in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is referring to the annual report for 2003 of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union and Norway, which was released in October 2003. The report found that cannabis is the most commonly used drug in EU countries. In this context, lifetime prevalence &mdash; i.e., any use during a person&rsquo;s life &mdash; among 15 to 16 year old schoolchildren for the use of cannabis in Ireland was reported as being 32%. Lifetime prevalence for solvents in the same age group was reported as 22% in the EMCDDA report.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy should note that the findings in the area of solvent and cannabis misuse in Ireland are primarily based on five year old data from the 1999 European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, ESPAD. The ESPAD study examines the prevalence of drug use, both legal and illegal, among 15 to 16 year old schoolchildren. In this context, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the results from the first drug prevalence survey in Ireland, which I launched in October of last year. The national advisory committee on drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland undertook this survey jointly. The survey provides solid statistical information and more up-to-date figures on drug use in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As part of the survey, a total of 8,442 people were interviewed on a face-to-face basis between October 2002 and April 2003 in line with EMCDDA guidelines. The relevant results are outlined in the following table:</P><Col N="1313"/>

        <P>Although this level of usage is still of concern, it shows Ireland to be more in line with European norms. In general, the drug prevalence survey found that the vast majority of the general <Col N="1314"/>population have never used any illegal drugs and that a relatively small percentage is currently using illegal drugs. However, I am aware that drug use &mdash; including the use of cannabis and <Col N="1315"/>solvents &mdash; continues to do much harm in society and the Government is determined to continue tackling it through the ongoing implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science implemented substance misuse prevention in all schools in the LDTF areas during the academic year 2001-02 and the social, personal and health programme, SPHE, has been on the curriculum of all primary and secondary schools since September 2003. This work is being supported by the SPHE support service, which has recruited additional trainers and support officers. In addition, the Department of Health and Children launched the first phase of a national awareness campaign in May 2003. The campaign features television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. Through actions like these we can equip people, particularly young people, with the skills and knowledge necessary to make informed choices about their health and future and reject drug use.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a sum of &euro;5.5 million was provided in the 2003 Revised Estimates of my Department for the improvement of Gaeltacht roads. However, a total of &euro;8.078 million was actually expended on such roads in 2003, representing a 47% increase on the original estimate. The provision of this additional funding enabled my Department, through the local authorities and other agencies involved, to carry out much of the two-year 2003-04 works programme in a single year. Accordingly, a sum of &euro;4.425 million has been allocated for Gaeltacht roads in the 2004 Revised Estimates. While this represents a reduction of 19% on the 2003 Revised Estimates, a total of &euro;12,503 million will now be spent on Gaeltacht roads over the two-year period 2003 to 2004.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 154 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;26.756 million has been has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for expenditure in the drugs area in 2004. This funding will primarily be spent on projects and initiatives funded through the local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, YPFSF, and research projects undertaken by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs. I am not in a position to say what moneys will ultimately be spent on YPFSF in 2004 as this will be dependent on demands on the Vote throughout the year.</P>
        <P>The Deputies should also note that funding of &euro;32.036 million was provided in 2003 for the drugs area within my Department&rsquo;s Vote. However, the actual outturn of expenditure last year was &euro;36.463 million, since an additional &euro;4.4 million was provided from savings within the Vote and allocated to the drugs area, primarily for the YPFSF. I assure the Deputies that funding for drugs in 2004 is not being reduced.</P>
        <P>The difference in provision, as outlined in 2004 Revised Estimates, arises from the mainstreaming of successfully evaluated services projects from round 1 of the YPFSF. Some 85 projects were positively evaluated and have been mainstreamed with effect from 1 January 2004. As a result, an amount of &euro;6.705 million has been transferred to the Votes of the Departments of Education and Science &mdash; &euro;6.594 million &mdash; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; &euro;0.111 million &mdash; which are now responsible for the continued funding of the projects in question. I will be making announcements about the second round of allocations under the fund in the very near future.</P>

	<P>The examination and research which have been undertaken gave rise to the Costello (1990) and Burton (1996) reports, which focused primarily on charitable fund-raising issues. More recently, there was a review of existing law in certain common law jurisdictions, for which Arthur Cox was the lead consultant (2002). Also in 2002, the Law Society report examined and made recommendations concerning the key legal issues at the core of charity law reform.</P>
        <P>The Deputy can access both the Arthur Cox and the Law Society reports on the dedicated charities regulation page of my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pobail.ie</i>. The up-to-date position at any given time on progress in preparation of the draft legislation can also be accessed on this page, under &ldquo;Key Milestones: Latest&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The community development support programme provides support to 46 locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in rural areas. The aim of the programme is to mobilise the capacity of disadvantaged communities to participate in mainstream local development, training and education and enterprise and employment opportunities. The programme provides core funding which equates to the cost of two full-time staff equivalents, usually a development worker and an administrator, together with the overheads and administration costs of running a resource centre.</P>
        <P>I am also supporting a small number of pilot projects aimed at testing the success of development workers in regenerating particularly disadvantaged rural areas. This initiative is being funded from my Department&rsquo;s rural development fund. These projects, located in Donegal, Galway and Kerry, involve a variety of community-based initiatives aimed at reducing rural deprivation. These projects will be evaluated later this year.</P>

	<P>Two actions for peace and justice outlined in the An Agreed Programme for Government apply to my Department. These actions relate to the consolidation of the success of the North/South Ministerial Council and the North/South implementation bodies, and to the development of strong bilateral relations with Scotland and Wales as well as the UK as a whole.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to work with the relevant parties, North and South, to consolidate the successful operation of two North/South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga (comprising Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulst&eacute;r-Scotch/The Ulster Scots Agency) and Waterways Ireland. Continued implementation of the PEACE II and INTERREG Ireland/<Miles com="jy"/>Northern Ireland programme also supports the peace and justice objectives contained in the An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The British-Irish Council is providing a valuable forum for consultation, discussion and the exchange of information among its members. Ireland is the lead administration within the British-Irish Council on the issue of drug misuse. In this context, the Taoiseach has hosted a summit meeting on the issue and Ministers with responsibility in this area within the British-Irish Council have met on two occasions to agree work programmes, which continue. In this regard, a number of meetings, conferences and seminars have taken place with colleagues from other British-Irish Council members including Scotland and Wales.</P>
        <P>This Department is also co-operating, within the British-Irish Council framework with Wales, which is the lead administration on the advancement of a programme to promote indigenous and lesser-used languages.</P>

Responsibility for reporting on such programmes rests with the other Ministers involved.</P>
        <P>As regards my own Department, ADM manages the local development social inclusion programme (LDSIP), RAPID programme and PEACE II programme. The total provided under the Revised Estimates in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for these programmes in 2003 was &euro;53.43 million. Under the LDSIP, funding is allocated to partnerships, community groups and territorial employment pacts to support actions under three <Col N="1322"/>measures &mdash; services for the unemployed, community-based youth initiatives and community development. Under the RAPID programme, funding is provided to ADM to support local areas in the preparation and implementation of their RAPID plans.</P>

	<P>The steering committee on cross-Border rural development in support of its work commissioned two studies in 2001 in relation to co-operation between cross border rural communities and cross border education, training and research in rural development.</P>
        <P>In relation to the co-operation study, the North/South Ministerial Council endorsed the main finding, namely that an area based approach to cross-Border rural development should be adopted. The rural initiative measure of the INTEREG 111 programme was identified as the vehicle through which this approach could be implemented. The measure was opened for application in August 2003 and closed on 31 October 2003. The total numbers of applications received was 18. These were considered by the INTERREG steering committee on 26 February 2004. Three applications have been conditionally accepted subject to economic appraisal, six deferred for further information and nine have been rejected.</P>
        <P>The second study on cross-Border education, training and research identified the need for greater co-ordination, accessibility and practical application of information on current education, training and research provision. Its main <Col N="1323"/>recommendation is the setting up of a one-stop shop for collecting, holding and disseminating information on training, research and education provision in the Border region.</P>
        <P>The steering committee agreed that the two lead Departments would write to all the universities, colleges and relevant organisations which had been included as part of the study for their views on how the main recommendation for the one-stop shop could best be implemented. A number of common suggestions for the format and functions of the one-stop-shop were identified from the comments received.</P>
        <P>The committee is currently considering the establishment of a web based one-stop shop for factual information and are exploring with the centre for cross-Border studies the possibility of amalgamating it with the centre&rsquo;s proposed website, <i>BorderIreland.info.</i></P>

        <Quest>the progress to date in his Department in ensuring that the full range of options, including wireless technology, are utilised to expand broadband access in rural areas as stated in his Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. CL&Aacute;R funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, telecommunications and sports projects.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline to the Deputy the particular advances being made under the programme to facilitate broadband and wireless technology infrastructure in CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>
        <P>I identified a pilot trial of broadband technology in selected industrial estates, business and educational/training centres in CL&Aacute;R areas as a potential measure in support of advanced broadband services in the regions. The trial would evaluate the broadband technology used <Col N="1326"/>for its potentially wider deployment throughout the CL&Aacute;R regions. Some 15 locations in CL&Aacute;R were identified as those that could benefit most from this initiative. Accordingly, in 2003, a call to third parties for the provision of broadband in these 15 CL&Aacute;R areas was placed by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on behalf of my Department. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is currently completing its evaluation of the proposals received.</P>
        <P>CL&Aacute;R funding has also been committed to support a wireless based internet service for three projects shared across five locations in CL&Aacute;R areas in the Border, midland and regional assembly area. The projects are in Dungloe, County Donegal, Killala, County Mayo, Enniscrone, County Sligo, Lanesborough, County Longford and Ballyleague, County Roscommon.</P>
        <P>In January 2003, the BMW regional assembly placed a call for expressions of interest for wireless Internet services in its region. Six projects were short-listed and three projects, across four locations, were finally selected. Three of these locations are in CL&Aacute;R areas &mdash; Ballinlough, County Roscommon, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo and Strokestown, County Roscommon. The fourth is in Virginia, County Cavan. Following discussions with the BMW regional assembly, my Department agreed to fund, under the CL&Aacute;R programme, the three remaining short listed projects on the same basis, that is, 80% equivalent to &euro;254,709 of the total cost. This brings to nine the number of rural towns and villages in the BMW region benefiting from this initiative.</P>
        <P>On the recommendation of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, CL&Aacute;R and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is co-funding town fibre optic networks to the industrial parks in Belmullet, County Mayo, and Dungloe, County Donegal. I am currently examining an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta proposal to co-fund the supply of fibre optic cable to all Gaeltacht industrial estates in CL&Aacute;R areas. I am also liaising with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on funding fibre optic cable supply to all industrial estates in CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>

	<P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the <Col N="1327"/>implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy provides that an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework will be carried out by the end of 2004.</P>
        <P>The strategy was developed following an extensive review process, overall responsibility for which rested with the interdepartmental group on drugs which I chair. The interdepartmental group on drugs established a sub-group &mdash; which comprised representatives of key departments and agencies and representatives of the community and voluntary sector &mdash; to manage the on-going work of the review. This structure proved very effective and in light of this, I propose putting similar arrangements in place to complete the mid-term evaluation.</P>
        <P>The review group, which I intend to establish within the coming weeks &mdash; will be constituted along the same lines as the original sub-group and will include appropriate community and voluntary sector representation. The review group will be tasked with developing the terms of reference for the evaluation and I would envisage that independent consultants will be employed to assist them in their deliberations over the coming months.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the review group will complete its work towards the end of 2004 and the findings will be taken on board for the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 163, 184 and 186 together.</P>
        <P>In my reply to Questions Nos. 141, 157 and 219 on 4 February I outlined my response to the report of the consultation group on access to waymarked ways including my decision to reconvene the consultation group as Comhairle na Tuaithe. The report of the consultation group has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The inaugural meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe was held on 26 February. I attended that meeting and outlined my views on the issues involved and assured the members that they would have the fullest possible support from<Miles com="jy"/>my Department in implementing the recommendations of the report. I have provided for funding for the employment of a research-development officer to assist in the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe. Advertisements will be placed shortly for a research-development officer who will work to deliver a prioritised work plan for Comhairle na Tuaithe in accordance with the recommendations of the report.</P>

	<P>The EU action plan on drugs 2000-2004 obliges each Presidency of the EU to facilitate a meeting of the national drugs co-ordinators. This meeting is usually attended by officials although individual national co-ordination structures vary and a small number of ministers may attend. The meeting under the Irish Presidency will be held in Clontarf Castle on 15 June 2004.</P>
        <P>The aim of these meetings is to provide an up-date on the various national drug situations, on developing drugs legislation and to exchange useful comparative data. The meeting also aims to foster exchanges of information and debate. The meeting in June will be the first meeting of national drug co-ordinators with 25 member states. The agenda for the meeting has not yet been finalised. Prior to finalisation, the proposed agenda will be discussed at the Horizontal Council Working Party on Drugs and it is open to member states to propose issues for discussion at the meeting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to Question Nos. 432 of 3 December 2002 and Nos. 431, 432, 433 and 434 of 27 May 2003 in which I set out details of the many schemes and initatives operated by my Department to assist rural and urban communities. Together, these schemes constitute an integrated approach in addressing problems associated with urban living and excessive and unbalanced growth, together with other Government measures such as the national spatial strategy. Some of the key measures administered by my Department are outlined as follows.</P>
        <P>The RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated areas, through targeting state resources available under the national development plan. Plans have been prepared in all areas and Departments are considering the proposals from these plans. A new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million capital funding is being made available in my Department&rsquo;s vote in 2004, to support small scale localised actions in RAPID areas, through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. I propose to announce full details of how this money will be spent shortly. In addition, funding of &euro;1.5 million is available to ADM to meet administration expenses and to provide support to area implementation teams to support them in the preparation and implementation of their plans. All of the RAPID areas and many of the partnerships and community groups support urban communities. Details of the areas covered by LDSIP and RAPID are available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Clearly, unemployment, drugs misuse and youth problems are difficulties which are manifest from urban living and unbalanced growth. In this context the bottom up approach inherent in measures funded by my Department under the local development social inclusion programmes and the community development programme, and drugs programmes are key mechanisms for bringing forward alternative and innovative solutions.</P>
        <P>The Leader programmes are innovative EU programmes put in place to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality <Col N="1334"/>strategies in rural communities with particular emphasis on community type projects. Total public funding of some &euro;150 million the period 2000 to 2006 about half of which is EU funding. One of the key aims of Leader is to maintain and develop local rural communities and creating opportunities for rural people to live and work in their local area.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibilities include the rural development aspects of the joint cross-Border programmes, PEACE and INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland and INTERREG Ireland-Wales as well as the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The rural measures under these programmes aim to foster the economic and social development of rural communities. In so doing, these programmes directly contribute to balanced growth in rural areas and thereby strengthening options to live and work in rural communities. These measures provide a total of &euro;43 million in the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
        <P>Finally, the CL&Aacute;R programme, for which &euro;13.49 million is being made available in the Vote of my Department in 2004, seeks to help redress depopulation and lack of services in rural areas. The measures contained in the CL&Aacute;R programme support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a range of areas including electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. As an integral part of this process my Department operates a number of programmes as set out below-designed to assist community development.</P>
        <P>The Leader programmes are EU programmes in place to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities including a number of rural enterprise projects. Some 22 local action groups throughout the country deliver the EU Leader+ initiative. The allocation for Leader+ for the period 2000 to 2006 is &euro;73.6 million which is co-funded by the EU. The Leader national rural development programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative and is operated by 13 local <Col N="1335"/>groups in areas of the country not covered by Leader+. It also provides nationwide coverage for rural and agricultural tourism and focuses more on mainstream activities. The allocation for 2000 to 2006 is &euro;75.7 million which is also co funded by the EU.</P>
       <?oasys _cl10.8-?><P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibilities also include the rural development aspects of the joint cross-Border programmes PEACE and INTERREG. The rural measures under these programmes aim to foster the economic and social development of rural communities. Projects supported by the programmes are community based as well as focused on farm diversification. Funding is also provided under the rural development measures of the PEACE II programme during the period 2000-2004. Support is available for cross border and cross community development and the development of agri-diversification projects. Total funding of &euro;10 million is being provided under the rural initiative measure of the joint INTERREG Ireland/Wales programme for the period 2000-2006. Under the programme support is being provided in the eligible area for joint projects promoting rural business skills, rural tourism, rural health and on and off farm diversification to complement agricultural activities. Under the joint INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland programme, funding of &euro;18 million is available under the rural initiative measure during the period 2000-2006. The aim of the measure is to encourage rural business and communities to engage in developing the economic and social sustainability of the region and to promote the development and expansion of cross border rural business.</P>
        <P>There is provision of &euro;42.144 million in my Department&rsquo;s vote for the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, which aims to promote social inclusion. Funding is allocated to partnerships and community groups, including rural based groups, to deliver the local development social inclusion programme under three measures &mdash; services for the unemployed, community based youth initiatives and community development.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;21.0 million has been allocated to the community development support programmes, CDSPs, in 2004 to support locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives. The total number of projects supported under the programme is currently 174, spread throughout the country. In addition to the schemes administered by my Department for the Gaeltacht and the islands the development of Gaeltacht areas, which are mainly rural, is actively supported by the activities of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. An t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s promotes enterprise and community focused schemes and provides assistance to Gaeltacht community co-operatives including Gaeltacht islands.</P>
        <P>I will continue to support the development of community spirit and co-operation in rural areas <Col N="1336"/>though the measures operating under the CL&Aacute;R programme. The priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas, with whom I consulted, are reflected in these measures which support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects.</P>
        <P>The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas. I intend to continue this practice for any new measures I may introduce, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the foregoing that there are a range of measures in place across my Department to support the development of community spirit and co-operation in rural areas. These will be further complemented by the implementation of the new rural social scheme.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the levels of disbursement for RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and the drug task force areas that are being ring-fenced in respect of his estimates for 2004; the way in which these amounts compare with 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows. Funding of &euro;5.8 million is provided for the RAPID programme in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2004. The breakdown of this amount is &euro;4.5 million for capital expenditure and &euro;1.3 million for current expenditure. The capital funding of &euro;4.5 million is a new dedicated fund that has been set aside in 2004 to support small scale local actions from RAPID plans. This funding will be used as leverage money to facilitate co-funding from State agencies. As regards the &euro;1.3 million current funding, this amount will be provided to ADM to meet administration expenses and to provide support to area implementation teams. The amount provided for this purpose in 2003 was &euro;1.5 million.</P>
        <P>The provision for the CL&Aacute;R Programme in 2004 is &euro;13.49 million which is a 42% increase over the 2003 allocation of &euro;9.517 million. This demonstrates the continuing commitment of the Government to this programme, originally initiated as a two year programme only. The 2004 provision will enable the continuation of investment under existing measures of the programme while providing the scope for the introduction of such new measures as may be identified during the year.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;26.756 million has been allocated, in the current year, to my Department&rsquo;s subhead which funds: local drugs task force plans, young peoples services and facilites, the operations of the national drugs strategy team and the national advisory committee on drugs. This is an increase of 5% on the allocation in 2003. The vast bulk of this money will be spent on drug task force areas. The research carried out by the NACD relates to drug misuse and therefore also has a considerable focus on drug task force areas. The Deputy should note that &euro;6.685 million from the Vote of my Department transferred to the Votes of the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are now responsible for the continued funding of 85 projects under the YPFSF which were mainstreamed with effect from 1 January 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. Since it was launched in May 2001, these Departments and agencies have made considerable progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. In particular, it should be noted that: Garda operations continue to result in significant drug seizures with an estimated street value of approximately &euro;49 million seized in 2002. Provisional indications for 2003 well exceed this figure. Both the Garda and the customs authorities remain well on track in achieving their drug seizure targets as set out in the national <Col N="1339"/>drugs strategy. Street level dealing is being tackled by specific Garda operations such as Clean Street and Nightcap; guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post primary schools in May 2002; the Department of Education and Science implemented substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools in the LDTF areas during the academic year 2001-02 and the social personal and health programme or SPHE has been on the curricula of all primary and secondary schools since September 2003. This work is being supported by the SPHE support service, which has recruited additional trainers and support officers; considerable progress is also being made on increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of December 2003, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,883. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032; ten regional drugs task forces or RDTFs have been established throughout the country. They are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas &mdash; as well as range and level of existing services &mdash; with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision; the Department of Health and Children launched a national awareness campaign in May 2003. The campaign features television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. This first phase targeted the general population while the second phase, launched in October, is aimed at parents. A third set of TV advertisements were recently aired; Customs and Excise has launched a coastal watch programme and have implemented a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry; and over 1,120 recovering drug misusers are now on the special F&Aacute;S community employment scheme.</P>
        <P>The strategy also provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of this year. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary. The Deputy should note that my Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces and for the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund or YPFSF.</P>
        <P>To date the Government has allocated or spent: approximately &euro;65 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the LDTFs; more than &euro;11.5 million under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of <Col N="1340"/>which are in LDTF areas; and approximately &euro;68 million to support in the region of 350 facility and services under the YPFSF. The main aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
        <P>I expect to make allocations under round II of the Fund in the very near future.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. The question of drug-related deaths was one of the issues considered in developing the strategy.</P>
        <P>At present, drug-related deaths are recorded by the general mortality register of the CSO, based on the International Classification of Diseases, ICD, code system. However, the available statistics are limited and relate to years prior to the commencement of the strategy. Other countries have developed dedicated systems for recording drug-related deaths and it is important, for the purposes of comparative analysis, that the Irish system is capable of generating an equivalent level of information. It is for this reason that one of the actions contained in the national drugs strategy calls for the development of an accurate mechanism for recording the number of such deaths. Overall responsibility for this action rests with the coroner&rsquo;s service and the Central Statistics Office and work has commenced on developing such a mechanism.</P>
        <P>International evidence supports the view that opiate misusers are safer in treatment, therefore every effort is being made in Ireland to encourage them into treatment. The Deputy will be aware that the treatment of drug misusers is the primary responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. In this context it is worth noting that the number of methadone treatment places has expanded considerably in recent years, in line with the commitment under the national drugs strategy. At the end of December 2003, there were 6,883 people receiving methadone treatment. This compares with a figure of just over 5,000 at the end of 2000.</P>
        <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority there are currently 59 drug treatment locations. This compares with 12 locations in 1997. Outside the ERHA, treatment clinics have been established in the South Eastern Health Board, <Col N="1341"/>Mid-Western Health Board, Western Health Board and Midland Health Board. General practitioners and pharmacists also provide treatment services and their involvement has also increased over the last number of years.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I am informed by the Department of Health and Children that all clients entering the addiction services are assessed and appropriate treatment plans are identified based on client needs. Decisions concerning the appropriate treatment for patients are made in accordance with best practice guidelines. In this regard, overdose prevention is an inherent part of the comprehensive range of services which the health boards provide, including education and prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, counselling and harm reduction.</P>
        <P>For opiate misusers outside of treatment, outreach workers and needle exchange services actively engage drug misusers to promote safer drug using practices to address the risks involved in terms of overdose, transmission of blood-borne viruses and unsafe sex practices. Harm minimisation is at the core of the Health Boards outreach strategy in the ERHA area, where heroin misuse is most prevalent and this includes the risk of overdose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08 as well as funding the work of the local drugs task forces, LDTFs, and the young peoples facilities and services fund, or YPFSF.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the House on many occasions, I am aware of the increase in the prevalence of cocaine use in Ireland, particularly through the work of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, which operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
        <P>Figures from the recent general population drug survey conducted by the NACD show that 3.1% of the population have ever used cocaine, 1.1% used it in the last 12 months and 0.3% used in the last month. Compared with similar surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that Ireland is roughly average in terms of use.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputies should be aware the numbers presenting for treatment are still very low and, in total, make up approx. 1% of those in treatment. Similarly, cocaine related offences remain relatively small compared to other drugs and, according to the recently published 2002 Garda annual report, account for approximately 5.5% of all such offences.</P><Col N="1343"/>
        <P>The increase in Ireland would appear to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price.</P>
        <P>In this context, as I have outlined to this House on a number of occasions recently, through the implementation of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces, the problem of cocaine use can and will be addressed. Each of the local drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities.</P>
        <P>These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including cocaine. We have to be aware that most drug users engage in poly-drug use and therefore projects should be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others.</P>
        <P>I also point out to the Deputies that regional drugs task forces have been established in each of the health board areas throughout the country. As a first step in the process of developing action plans, the task forces are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and the level and range of existing services. Where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in their action plans.</P>
        <P>On treatment, as the Deputies are probably aware there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and I am advised that existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best options available. The Deputies should note that the three area health boards of the Eastern Region Health Authority have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years. I assure the Deputies that I am keeping the matter of cocaine use under review. Furthermore, it should be noted that the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in that context.</P>

These new measures will be confined to the spouses of persons working here on working visas-work authorisations, to spouses of certain intra-company transferees and spouses of certain academics and researchers. In cases where some medical professionals are still working on work permits these will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</P>

	<P>I am informed that applications for chefs in ethnic restaurants can be revisited depending on the circumstances of the proposed employer and employee.</P>
        <P>My Department is quite happy to facilitate the development and expansion of the ethnic restaurant sector and I accept that it is quite reasonable to expect that this will involve the granting of work permits to an appropriate number of persons from what might be termed the source countries of the ethnic groups concerned. My Department has adopted a very liberal and generous approach in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>However, the Department is concerned that employers should fully explore the possibility of filling these positions from within the EU, where it is aware there are very large communities from the main ethnic groups who are active in the restaurant sector.</P>
        <P>My Department is also concerned at the large number of applications from what are ostensibly new restaurants opening at familiar addresses, the number of chefs required by small restaurants and applications in respect of unqualified persons, all of which have to come from the ethnic source countries.</P>
        <P>In future, these applications will be considered taking into account the following factors such as the size-seating capacity of the restaurant concerned, the overall number of staff envisaged, the ratio of chefs to ancillary staff, the proportion of EU nationals employed including those of the relevant ethnic group and the qualifications of those persons whom the employer intended to bring into the State on foot of a work permit.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a new programme in relation to community enterprise centres (CECs). As the Deputy will appreciate this is primarily an operational matter for Enterprise Ireland, however there are no proposals at present to launch any further programme. Any proposal would arise in the context of Enterprise Ireland examining the impact and success of previous initiatives and identifying any outstanding issues requiring State support. On foot of such an examination, Enterprise Ireland may then formulate a new proposal for submission to my Department. Such a proposal would be considered by my Department, in consultation <Col N="1350"/>with the Department of Finance, with due regard to policy priorities and available resources.</P>
        <P>Previous CEC programmes were designed so that local communities would make applications to Enterprise Ireland and take the lead role in the projects. Issues such as the availability of IDA land would generally be matter between the applicants and the IDA and be dealt with on a bilateral basis.</P>
        <P>I cannot comment on the remit of Kildare County Council, nor on whether an application from a local authority would be eligible under the criteria of any new CEC programme. Under separate cover, I will send details of the last programme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria for the Deputy&rsquo;s information. Under this scheme, 35 local communities received capital funding towards the cost of developing-extending an enterprise centre.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the death of a serving member of the Permanent Defence Force, who tragically lost his life during the course of a civilian parachute jump while on annual leave in Holland.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
        <P>The military authorities advise that a liaison team, which consisted of a senior officer and a senior non-commissioned officer from the deceased&rsquo;s unit, was established following his tragic death. This team established and maintained contact with the officially designated next of kin, the sister of the deceased. She is the person who is recorded on all Defence Forces documentation as the officially designated next of kin of the deceased. However, as a matter of courtesy, the liaison team also contacted the father of the deceased and maintained contact with him throughout the period following the tragedy.</P>
        <P>The military authorities have advised that this tragic death took place while the deceased was on annual leave abroad. Therefore, the deceased was not on duty as a member of the Defence Forces at the time of the tragedy. However, Defence Force regulations require that a court of inquiry should be held where any person subject to military law suffers a fatal injury, regardless of whether he or she is on or off duty at the time. A court of inquiry was therefore held in relation to the circumstances of the deceased&rsquo;s death in accordance with these regulations.</P>
        <P>There are certain statutory limitations on the release of the findings of military courts of inquiry. The military authorities have informed me that the general conclusions of the inquiry were that this death was the result of a tragic accident. The military authorities advise that the circumstances of the death were investigated by the Dutch police in accordance with their own procedures under Dutch law. If they have not already done so, relatives may contact the Dutch police through the agency of the Royal Netherlands Embassy, whose contact address and other details have been provided.</P>

        <Quest>the position in regard to the overholders on the Curragh Camp, County Kildare; the position of the sale of the Orchard Park estate to the residents of the estate at the Curragh; the position of refurbishment of the residential quarters on the Curragh; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Personnel on being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the dates of their discharge. The individuals overholding 54 married quarters were written to in August 2002, and requested to vacate the properties. To date five of the quarters have been vacated and two others have been purchased by the occupants. A further nine of the properties have been offered for sale and a number of those sales are likely to be finalised in the near future.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, regarding the re-housing of those overholders who would, in the normal way, be eligible for local authority housing. The Department will remain in contact with the overholders pending resolution of the issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to the sale of the 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, the position is that 93 of the occupants have opted to purchase and, to date, 82 of the sales have been completed. In addition, contracts of sale and deeds of transfer have been executed in respect of two further cases.</P>
        <P>Married quarters for members of the Defence Forces have for some time been considered an anachronism and it is the policy of the Department to discontinue them in a managed and orderly manner, save in exceptional circumstances. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category. Inspections of married quarters are carried out by the military authorities from time to time and it is the policy not to reallocate quarters which are considered sub-standard.</P>
        <P>In recent years it has been the practice only to carry out emergency repairs to married quarters and this policy will continue in the future. The military authorities estimate that about &euro;100,000 was expended over the past five years in carrying out such repairs. Rents for married quarters are considerably less than the market value rental valuation for the properties and in this regard negotiations with the representative associations on increases in charges are currently at an advanced stage. However, any revised rates that might be agreed will reflect the present condition of the quarters and those rates would have to be adjusted to reflect any future investment in married quarters.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the ongoing industrial relations dispute involving the Northern Ireland Civil Service. While action which could potentially affect veterinary controls at points of entry on to the island of Ireland is undesirable, EU veterinary health rules place a significant onus on the member state of dispatch in the case of intra-community trade, and on the member state at which the product first enters the territory of the EU in the case of third country imports. Cross-Border trade in live animals has, since the resumption of trade after the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001, been subject to full intra-community veterinary health rules. These provide that animals traded between member states must be accompanied by official EU veterinary health certificates and identified in accordance with the relevant Council directives.</P>
        <Miles com="cl" par="105"/><P>In so far as intra-community trade in animal-based products is concerned, imports are permitted only where the products are sourced <Col N="1355"/>from an approved establishment, are appropriately labelled and travel with a commercial document. The primary onus regarding compliance of goods involved in intra community trade is on the competent authority of the member state of dispatch.</P>
        <P>Products imported into the EU from third countries may be imported only through an approved Border inspection post, BIP, at which all of the required veterinary checks are carried out. The port of Larne is not an approved BIP and such products will have already been subjected to the required EU health checks at their initial point of entry into the EU.</P>

He was not paid as he failed to co-operate with the inspecting officer and did not produce satisfactory documentary evidence that he was the owner of the sheep at the time of application and at the end of the retention period, that is, 28 April 2000. His appeal to the independent appeals unit of my Department was not accepted.</P>
        <P>The person applied for the 2001 ewe premium scheme on 317 ewes. Owing to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, no on-farm inspection of his flock took place. Instead, additional administrative checks were introduced in 2001 to verify that the number of ewes applied for under the 2001 ewe premium scheme were in the ownership and possession of applicants at the time of application. Certain applicants, including the person named, were requested to submit certain documentation, that is, purchase-sales dockets, but the person named failed to do so.</P>
        <P>In this case, the person named failed to satisfy my Department that he was the owner of the sheep in year 2000 and he was also unable to show that he owned the ewes when he applied for the 2001 ewe premium scheme. In the circumstances, payment cannot be made in this instance.</P>

	<P>The Government has a 3% target for the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The annual survey undertaken by my Department of the position on the employment of staff with a disability in the Civil Service, shows that 931 people with a disability were employed <Col N="1357"/>at the end of December 2002 &mdash; equivalent to 2.8% of total numbers. This compares with 891 people, 2.78%, in 2001 and 758 people, 2.56%, in 2000. Figures for end December 2003 are being compiled. It is important in view of these figures to support and assist Departments in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policy.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made to ensure an equal opportunity for success is given to all candidates applying for competitions for recruitment to the civil service. All candidates are requested to identify any special requirements they may have in order to sit the relevant examination, for example sign language. My Department commissioned independent research into the operation of the 3% target and the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. In the light of the consultants&rsquo; recommendations, proposals to improve the operation of the policy are also being considered by the Government. The aim is not to change the policy, but to ensure its importance is emphasised and that Departments are given assistance in meeting the aims of the policy.</P>

	<P>The humanitarian aid scheme for victims of the landslides in North Mayo was administered on a confidential basis by the Irish Red Cross Society on behalf of the Office of Public Works. The purpose of the scheme was to relieve hardship <Col N="1358"/>and not to provide compensation for losses. While the closing date for applications for aid under the scheme was 26 November 2003, a number of late applications were received by the IRCS and these were dealt with appropriately. However, the approved funding for the scheme has been exhausted and there are no plans to provide further funds for humanitarian aid in the current year. As the scheme is confidential to the individual applicants and the IRCS, I am not in a position to comment in further detail.</P>

	<P>I am informed that the toxicology test report for the case in question was forwarded to the Dublin county coroner on 23 February 2004. I am conscious of the importance of the service provided to the coroners by the State Laboratory and the impact it inevitably has on relatives of people whose deaths are the subject of inquests at a time of great distress. The management of the laboratory share that sensitivity and constantly monitor the service by reviewing available resources, the possibilities for outsourcing and the complexity of analyses.</P>
        <P>I understand that additional resources have been allocated to the toxicology section and there has been a substantial increase in the number of analyses completed. However, there is still a backlog of cases, due to an increase of 50% in the past two years in the number of cases referred, and a general increase in the complexity of the analyses required.</P>
        <P>A range of measures are being taken at present to reduce the turnaround time of samples sent to the laboratory and processed by its toxicology section. Additional priority is to be given to the coroners&rsquo;s cases over other work of the section. Laboratory management are also reviewing the procedures and processes in the toxicology area with a view to automating as much as possible.</P>
        <P>The possibilities of reducing the complexity of testing were discussed between the State Laboratory and the coroners and their representatives, as doing so would have an immediate impact on turnaround times. However, it was not considered possible to reduce the complexity of tests performed by the laboratory in view of the constant demand from families for comprehensive analysis, the increasing complexity of the cocktail of drugs potentially taken by victims which requires sequential analyses to be carried out and coroner&rsquo;s requirement for quality analytical data, which will withstand scrutiny in a court.</P>

The scheme is administered by the Prize Bond Company Limited, acting as agent for the National Treasury Management Agency. The Prize Bond Company is a joint venture owned equally by An Post and FEXCO, Killorglin, County Kerry. Draws are held every Friday at 10.30 a.m. in the GPO, O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin, and are open to the public. The results are also presented on the website of the Prize Bond Company <i>www.prizebonds.ie</i>. At present, over 1,960 prizes are awarded to bondholders each week.</P>
        <P>The draw is fully computerised. The process involves the generation of a sequence of random bond serial numbers by means of a specially written computer programme. Prizes, commencing with the largest, are then awarded to the winning bondholders in the order in which the bond numbers were drawn. The draw software has been verified by independent statistical consultants. They also analyse the results of every draw to check for randomness and their reports are submitted to, and evaluated by, the National Treasury Management Agency on a regular basis. In addition, a representative of the National Treasury Management Agency attends every draw so as to ensure strict adherence to the operational procedures set down for the conduct of the draw.</P>

	<P>The Government strongly support the work of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Kosovo, Mr. Harri Holkeri, to ensure the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244. I discussed the situation in Kosovo with Mr. Holkeri when he visited Dublin on 19 December last for consultations in advance of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. As we hold the Presidency, we are remaining in close contact with the Special Representative and with the UN Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK. Considerable progress has been made in Kosovo since 1999, under UN administration. However, the situation in Kosovo remains uncertain, and it retains the potential to affect the stability of the wider region of the western Balkans. The Government believes that it is essential that the international community maintains its commitment to the creation of a secure, multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, on the basis of Resolution 1244. The EU has a long-term commitment to Kosovo. We recognise that a solution in Kosovo will be found in the overall context of the European perspective of the countries of the western <Col N="1362"/>Balkans. In the second half of 2003, UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo agreed on the strengthening of the policy of standards before status through a process of defining the reform objectives for Kosovo, with regular reviews leading to an overall review sometime in mid-2005. The standards for Kosovo document was launched in December. Special Representative Holkeri, in consultation with the authorities in Kosovo and the wider international community, is now finalising a detailed standards implementation work plan, which he hopes to present to the UN Security Council in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>An essential element in the standards process leading up to the mid-2005 review is the development of the direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina on practical issues of mutual concern. The dialogue was launched in Vienna on 14 October 2003, with the establishment of four working groups, on energy, transport and telecommunications, missing persons, and refugee returns. Following a period of political difficulty, the first meeting of the working group on energy was successfully held in Pristina on 4 March and the first meeting of the group on missing persons is scheduled for today, 9 March. This is an encouraging development. The EU looks forward to practical results from the dialogue in the months ahead, which will be in the interests of the people of Kosovo and of their neighbours. The General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed on 23 February that the UN-led policy of implementing standards and the EU&rsquo;s efforts to promote the European perspective of Kosovo are mutually reinforcing and represent parallel tracks of the same process. As EU Presidency, Ireland has maintained the priority attached to the situation in the western Balkans and has ensured that close attention is paid to the situation in Kosovo, in co-operation with Special Representative Holkeri and with the wider international community.</P>
        <P>Following the February Council discussion on Kosovo, the Presidency is considering with member states ways and means of further enhancing the contribution of the EU to the implementation of Resolution 1244, building further on the lead role played by the Union in support of economic reconstruction and development in Kosovo.</P>

	<P>In 2003 I received requests from a number of governing bodies of institutes of technology for approval to apply the student service charge to defray the costs of registration, examinations and student services, to students enrolled on F&Aacute;S apprenticeship courses. The institutes argued that a <i>pro rata</i> charge should be levied on apprentices on the basis that they avail of the full range of services provided to students in the institutes. The institutes considered that it was inequitable to levy the charge on full-time students only as this gave rise to a situation whereby full-time students were effectively subsidising apprentices through their contributions toward the cost of providing student services.</P><Col N="1364"/>
        <P>Following consideration of the case made by the institutes of technology, I decided to approve the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>student services charge for F&Aacute;S apprentices from January 2004.</P>
        <P>Unlike other categories of students, apprentices receive wages and either a travel or an accommodation allowance while studying in the institutes. Nevertheless, the institutes are prepared to consider reducing or waiving the charge in cases where it would cause hardship to the apprentice or their family.</P>

It has been assigned a band two rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</P>
        <P>The proposed project will be authorised to progress to advanced architectural planning during 2004.</P>
        <P>Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year&rsquo;s programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</P>

	<P>The provision to appeal against a decision to suspend or exclude a pupil is set out under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 rather than, as the Deputy&rsquo;s question states, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on its behalf refuses to enrol a student, suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year or expels a student from the school. The file which I have forwarded to the Deputy details the number of appeals against suspensions and expulsions which have been made under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 up to 31 January 2004. The reasons underlying each suspension or exclusion are unique to the particular case and each appeal is considered by the appeals committee having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. My Department does not seek to categorise the reasons given for suspensions or exclusions in appeal cases.</P>

	<P>My Department has reviewed the processes whereby it supports a range of in-service activities for personnel working in schools at primary and post-primary levels. This was undertaken in the context of reorienting support from a centralised system to one of local delivery based on local requirements and needs through the established national network of education centres. To rationalise matters and to make the best use of available resources, direct support to schools and other bodies and groups, including the school chaplains&rsquo; association, is no longer available directly from my Department. Therefore, schools and others are advised to contact their local education centre whose role it is to provide local in-service and support, advice and assistance to schools and their personnel in these matters. This approach will help avoid duplication and make the best use of available resources.</P>

The report of the working group was <Col N="1367"/>recently submitted to me and a copy has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. Issues dealt with in the report include the content and format of the examination modules, the standard of the examinations and courses of study for applicants for the examinations. The report is under consideration and decisions on the recommendations contained in it, including a recommendation that teaching methodology should be assessed by means of a classroom based practical assessment, will be taken in due course. The working group earlier drafted an interim syllabus which was circulated to all schools in December 2002.</P>
        <P>The SCG examinations held in October, 2003 were the first series of SCG examinations to be <Col N="1368"/>based on this syllabus. Copies of the interim syllabus, which included a reading list of prose and poetry to be studied for the examinations, are available on request from primary administration section 1, Department of Education and Science, Cornamaddy, Athlone, County Westmeath. An updated language syllabus for the SCG has also been published on the Department&rsquo;s website together with a handbook for the examination which was drafted by the working group. The handbook contains detailed information on the SCG and provides answers to a wide range of questions raised by candidates. It is planned to produce a textbook of relevant prose and poetry for future examinations.</P>

        <P>Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all of these <Col N="1370"/>cases were responded to before or soon after the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision. The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools.</P>

        <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which an application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of grant applications for the current academic year was 29 <Col N="1371"/>August 2003. However the awarding bodies, at their own absolute discretion, may accept applications after this date. These applications are considered late applications and some awarding bodies have a policy of dealing firstly with applications received before the closing date and then attending to the late applications. I understand that County Galway VEC has confirmed to officials in my Department that they received an application from this candidate last October. Further information was recently requested by County Galway VEC from the candidate and has since been received. Officials in my Department have been advised by County Galway VEC that it will shortly be in a position to contact this candidate concerning her grant application.</P>

	<P>The proposed large-scale building project for An Scoil tAthair Tadgh, Carrig na bhFear, County Cork is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. This proposed project is at stage 4 and 5 &mdash; detail design and bills of quantities &mdash; of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multiannual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multiannual framework for the school building programme which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year&rsquo;s programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</P>

	<P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project is a primary school initiative launched in 1996. It seeks to discriminate positively in favour of primary schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds. Any decision to expand or extend any of the initiatives dealing with tackling educational disadvantage will be considered in the context of a broad review of all such initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage which is currently under way in my Department.</P>

        <Quest>further to circular letter SPEO 24/03, the extent and the nature of the misapplication of the terms of circulars mentioned and identified following reviews of applications and allocations by the national educational psychological service and the inspectorate in 2002 and 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In Autumn 2002, my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate conducted a review of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</P>
        <P>The survey established that of the 6,908 pupils enrolled in the schools surveyed, 3% were enrolled in special classes, 6% were in receipt of resource teacher support and 12% were in receipt of learning support provision. Thus a total of 9% of pupils in the sample had been identified as having significant physical, sensory, intellectual or emotional disabilities. The survey report contrasted this 9% figure with the findings of the special education review committee, which estimated that pupils with such significant disabilities amounted to an estimated 2% of the school population, of which half, 1%, were being educated in mainstream schools.</P>
        <P>In England and Wales, approximately 275,000 pupils have statements of special educational needs. This equates with approximately 3% of all pupils and would be in line with expected levels internationally. While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability, the report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, it expressed concern that the greater availability of resource teachers in recent years may also have led to over-identification of special needs in schools.</P>
        <P>The potential for such over-identification arises particularly in regard to children who are on the borderline of intellectual disability. While many such children have been the subject of applications for resource teacher and or special needs assistant support, it is considered that their <Col N="1374"/>needs could more appropriately be addressed by the learning support teacher service.</P>
        <P>In general, there is concern that some applications for special supports reflect an approach which is based on what the child might benefit from, as opposed to what a child is actually entitled to, having regard to the professionally-assessed needs involved and the terms of departmental circulars which specify the support rates applicable to each disability category.</P>
        <P>In winter 2002, a review was carried out by the national educational psychological service and covered a total of 788 applications from schools for resource teacher and/or special needs assistant support. The applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought. Of the 1,590 pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, 60%, of these pupils conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought in these cases have been sanctioned. Deficiencies were identified in the remaining 642 cases. Where possible in such cases, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and such resources have been sanctioned. However, in some cases, for example, where the school was unable to produce the relevant assessment report, no recommendation for resources could be made.</P>
        <P>Applications for special educational needs received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September. All of these cases were responded to and resources granted where applications complied with the relevant circulars. We continue to respond to emergency applications.</P>
        <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nation-wide census of SER provision.</P>
        <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

        <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August, 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received.

	<P>Since 1998, my Department has made grants available for child care expenses for students on the VTOS, youthreach and senior Traveller centre further education programmes. This was to facilitate the participation on these programmes of people for whom they were designed but who were not able to enrol on them because of child care responsibilities. These grants are paid annually by my Department to the vocational education committees. The grant is intended as a contribution to costs. VECs determine the level of provision and have discretion to bridge the gap between my Department&rsquo;s grant and the actual costs they approve.</P>
        <P>The administration of grants to participants is a matter for individual VECs. A working group of representatives of my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association has been established to review the criteria for the allocation of grants for child care for 2004 and into the future. The initial budget for this service in 2003 was &euro;2,984,204. This was later supplemented by a special fund of more than &euro;1.8 million, giving a total &euro;4,821,759. This provision has been continued in 2004. Although the non-pay provision for such further education programmes as the vocational training opportunities scheme is contained in subhead D6, the child care provision is in subhead B5.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 and 276 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware of recent complaints regarding the activities of certain fishing vessels operating off the north Mayo area. The Department is currently carrying out an investigation of these complaints in co-operation with the Irish Naval Service. As part of this investigation my Department has checked to ascertain which fishing vessels have a recent history of fishing off the north Mayo coast. The licensing authority of my Department has now confirmed that the fishing vessels involved all hold current sea-fishing boat licences and the Department is checking whether the conditions of those licences appear to have been breached.</P>
        <P>There is an agreed code of practice, under the aegis of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and with the co-operation of the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, to regulate the shared use of the fishery off the north Mayo coast for both static and towed fishing gear. This code of practice specifically includes a mechanism for dealing with damage to static gear, particularly lobster pots, caused by larger fishing vessels. The code has operated successfully for some years, and great credit must go to the fishermen and their organisations, which continue to co-operate in this matter. It would be a matter of concern if it is shown that the code of conduct is no longer being adhered to.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have instructed the appropriate officials in my Department to re-examine the enforcement of existing regulatory requirements in respect of all vessels operating in this area.</P>

	<P>The widespread availability of high speed, affordable, always-on broadband access is central to the development of Ireland as a knowledge and information society.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved a national group broadband scheme to address the broadband needs in under-served small, rural or more remote communities. It is envisaged that, under this scheme, local community organisations will partner with broadband service providers to make a joint application for grant aid for the capital costs associated with the provision of broadband services in their locality.</P>
        <P>While it is anticipated that in the majority of cases community organisations will seek to <Col N="1385"/>partner with existing recognised and authorised broadband service providers, it is not a condition of the scheme that they must do so. There is nothing precluding not-for-profit groups applying for funding under this scheme.</P>
        <P>In reviewing applications under this scheme, my Department will seek to ensure that grant aided projects meet the current and projected broadband needs of end users in the community; provide a sustainable service, that is, that the service is technically and financially viable on an ongoing basis after initial grant aid support; are implemented in a focused and readily achievable manner; meet the requirements specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation for the provision of broadband services; and adopt a cost-effective approach which minimises the public funding requirement.</P>

	<P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 351 on 24th February last, under the sports capital programme funding is provided towards the capital costs of providing new facilities, the renovation-upgrading of existing facilities and the provision of permanently based sports equipment. A total of almost &euro;267 million has been allocated to more than 3,500 sports facilities under this programme since 1998. The payment of salaries of personnel to manage these facilities does not form part of the programme and there are no proposals to provide for such support.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Sports Council, ISC, provides funding to the national governing bodies of sport towards sport development programmes. While an element of this funding is to meet the costs of administrative support for national governing bodies of sport and the local sports partnerships and specialist technical personnel by national governing bodies of sport, it does not extend to the employment of the personnel referred to by the Deputy.

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may arrange for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with any of the following conditions who do not have a medical card, for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for people under 16 only &mdash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>There are a range of other schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I launched the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland, in October 2003. Its recommendations have been accepted by Government which agrees that a major programme is now required to develop rapidly clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The development of these centres as a clinical network is of paramount importance and will, in the shortest possible timeframe, begin to address the profound deficit in radiation therapy services that has been identified in the report. The implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations is the single most important priority in cancer services in the acute hospital setting.</P>
        <P>The report on the development of radiation oncology services agrees in principle with the existing international recommendations that a population of greater than 650,000 should, where possible, be the minimum population necessary to support a radiation oncology unit. This population of itself is not sufficient without adherence to additional guidelines, including that the majority of radiation oncology treatment facilities should be located within the context of a supra-regional cancer centre.</P>
        <P>The expert group undertook a detailed analysis of submissions from all health boards in relation to their existing and future plans for the development of clinical radiation oncology facilities in conjunction with the information available on future population and caseload projections for individual health boards provided by the Central Statistics Office and the national cancer registry. The population served by the Southern Health Board and adjacent regions and that of the collective area health boards constituting the eastern region meet the suggested 650,000 population minimum requirement for the development of a radiation therapy centre as defined in the 1996 national cancer strategy. The supra-regional centre at UCHG will deliver radiation oncology services to a considerably larger geographic catchment than the existing Western Health Board, with an estimated catchment population of 620,000.</P>
        <P>I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will <Col N="1389"/>ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and, as more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services. Last week I approved the appointment of a consultant radiation oncologist for the Southern Health Board with sessional commitments to the South Eastern Health Board. This will significantly improve access to radiotherapy services for patients in the south-east.</P>
        <P>The Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to the efficacy of developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the report, I have established the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group, which recently held its first meeting, comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group&rsquo;s remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. I expect the group to develop proposals in these important areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290, 295, 305 and 306 together.</P>
        <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the pharmacy review group report. I established the pharmacy review group in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, which included the use of the derogation. The group submitted its report on 31 January 2003, and the report is available on my department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.doh.ie</i>, along with reports prepared for the group by Indecon international economic consultants.</P>
        <P>I have been examining the complex legal and other issues surrounding the group&rsquo;s recommendations, including those concerning Ireland&rsquo;s use of the derogation. Under Article 2.2 of Directive 85/433/EEC on the free movement of pharmacists, EU and EEA pharmacists who qualified in another EU or EEA state cannot own in their own right, operate or manage a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old. These regulations do not preclude such pharmacists from working in a pharmacy less than three years old other than as a supervising pharmacist. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is responsible for the registration of pharmacists and for recognition of non-EU pharmacy qualifications. It has reciprocal arrangements with its counterparts in Australia and New Zealand which give recognition to the pharmacy qualifications of these countries.</P>
        <P>Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the report&rsquo;s recommendations before completion of this examination.</P>

        <P>It should be noted that general practitioners make a clinical decision on whether a domiciliary visit is appropriate based on the symptoms of the patient as presented at the time. If the Deputy is aware of a particular doctor who is refusing to make a domiciliary visit to a medical card patient, I would be happy to have the matter investigated with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, upon receipt of the relevant details.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda clearance arrangements apply in respect of candidates for paid employment in the health services where they would have access to children and vulnerable individuals. This includes services in respect of children and vulnerable adults provided by external agencies but funded by the health boards.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has informed me that, <Col N="1400"/>following a review of Garda vetting arrangements, a central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to deal with the then known demand for vetting. It was envisaged that when the unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared that a phased extension of Garda clearance arrangements to other groups would take place.</P>
        <P>To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons, be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placement. The Department of Health and Children participated in the working group with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General. The working group has completed its work and will report to the Garda Commissioner and, in turn, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers and organisations to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice and checking references, and also when it comes <Col N="1401"/>to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>
        <P>Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children recognises the need to support community and voluntary groups develop best practice in their dealings with children. A document, entitled Our Duty to Care, was published in by my Department in April 2002. It is based on Children First and is available to all groups. Essentially it promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children and consists of a booklet and fact sheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff. It also provides advice on how to report concerns to the health boards.</P>

	<P>Following discussions between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Minister of Social and Family Affairs obtained approval in the budget for 2003 providing for transfer of the pocket money allowance from my Department to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. One of the first tasks regarding this transfer is to identify recipients of the pocket money allowance and the recipients of the disability allowance who are in residential care. A request to provide this information was sent to all the health boards by my Department in January 2004 and is being compiled.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is <Col N="1402"/>substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year. Where medical confirmation is supplied which pre-dates the actual date of application and the health board&rsquo;s senior area medical officer is satisfied that the child required continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age, then payment may be made from the date the senior area medical officer is satisfied that such additional care and attention was required.</P>
        <P>When the child is approaching the age of 16, he or she is advised to apply for disability allowance to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Generally, those who satisfied the medical conditions for domiciliary care allowance will satisfy the medical conditions for disability allowance. However, there is not an automatic right to disability allowance which is a means-tested payment.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of health services in counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway rests with the Western Health Board in the first instance. The board has advised my Department that the hospice bed at the county hospital, Roscommon, is open and palliative care patients are accommodated <Col N="1403"/>throughout the hospital according to medical need. The board has further advised that Mayo General Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, do not have hospice beds.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are difficulties surrounding the operation of the in-patient unit at the Galway Hospice and that no new patients are being admitted at present.

        <P>The Western Health Board has informed my Department that an independent expert group was established by the Galway Hospice Foundation to review procedures at the hospice and that the expert group has forwarded its report to legal advisers, in accordance with the indemnity arrangements of the insurers, and the report is expected very shortly.</P>

	<P>Coovagh House is a five place special care unit operated by the Mid-Western Health Board catering for boys aged 11 to 17 years which provides residential, educational and therapeutic supports in a secure setting for a small number of non-offending children in need of special care or protection. The unit caters for children from the Mid-Western, Southern and South Eastern health boards. A court order of detention is required to place a child in the unit.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that Coovagh House special care unit has the following admission criteria in place: the young person is aged 11 to 17 years, has a history of absconding from other care settings and is, on an objective basis, likely to harm himself or others; that the behaviour of the young person is such that it poses a real and substantial risk to his health, safety, development and welfare; the young person has failed to respond to intervention offered in open conditions and a less secure environment would not meet the young person&rsquo;s needs at the time of placement; and all other forms of intervention have been exhausted or are unsuitable. It should be noted that, in addition, a young person must have a statutory care plan which includes an identified discharge-aftercare plan.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic services in Kildare rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. My Department has therefore asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matters raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>
        <P>I have taken a range of measures to improve orthodontic services in the ERHA. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is therefore an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics, including five from the ERHA. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;2.044 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001, and this has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff and build additional orthodontic facilities. In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA received &euro;1.815 million for the treatment of cases in this way. Finally, the chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that, at the end of the December quarter 2003, there were 4,656 children getting orthodontic treatment from the authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines. The guidelines were issued in 1985 and are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than in category B. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available in terms of qualified staff in the area, and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. Consequently, a category C waiting list may not be maintained in some health boards.</P>
        <P>In 1996, my Department wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards recommending that a group, representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists, review the orthodontic service. The report of this group, known as the Moran report, referred to an index of treatment need, an alternative means of assessing children&rsquo;s need for orthodontic treatment.</P>
        <P>Following the 2002 Oireachtas joint committee report on orthodontics, the Health Board Executive adopted the report of the review group set up by the chief executive officers with the following terms of reference: to review and report on progress to date on the recommendations set out in the Moran report; to consider the recommendations in the February 2002 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children; and to make revised recommendations and prepare and cost an action plan in the context of the approach set out in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; a Health System for You. The report confirms that the shortage of trained orthodontists restricts the use of this index by health boards at present.</P>
        <P>However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards <Col N="1408"/>funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. There is therefore an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities and will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards and authorities have informed me that at the end of the December quarter 2003, there were 21,727 children getting orthodontic treatment from those authorities and boards. This means that there are more than twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated, and 4,432 extra children are getting treatment from health boards and authorities since the end of 2001.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Two people are before the courts on charges relating to the transmission of hepatitis C via blood and blood products. The issue of possible prosecutions relating to the transmission of HIV via blood products is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on these matters.</P>
        <P>I have met on a number of occasions with the support groups representing persons who acquired hepatitis C and HIV via blood and blood products and have listened carefully to the issues which they have brought to my attention. Officials of my Department have regular contact with persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV and their families, and are familiar with the issues which are of concern to these groups. There are a number of fora where my officials, the support groups and the service providers meet together to work in collaboration on relevant matters.</P>
        <P>The Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was established in 1996 and has 16 members, appointed for a three-year period. The four main patient support groups, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, Irish Kidney Association, Irish Haemophilia Society, perform a vital role as advocates for their members and nominate six of the members of the consultative council. The council operates on the basis of equality and teamwork and has proved a useful forum for pursuing issues of national concern. In collaboration with the council and the support groups within the last year alone my Department has published an information guide on primary care and hospital services for persons with hepatitis C; two information leaflets, one on the Health (Amendment) Act card and one on hospital services for persons with hepatitis C, organised an information day on hepatitis C in Dublin Castle, and organised an international conference on hepatitis C which took place on 25 to 27 June in Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations of the Lindsay tribunal was for the establishment of a National Haemophilia Council to advise on all aspects of the care and treatment of persons with haemophilia. The council has had two meetings this year on an<i> ad hoc </i>basis, and will be established under statutory instrument in the coming weeks. The product selection and monitoring group, which will become a committee of the council under the planned statutory instrument, has been operating successfully on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for almost three years now. Both the council and the PSMAG include representatives of my Department, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the relevant service providers working in co-operation together.</P><Col N="1410"/>
        <P>In addition to the consultative bodies, regular meetings are held at national level between the support groups, service providers and my Department in order to monitor services and identify emerging needs on an ongoing basis. The support groups also meet with individual hospitals and consultants to discuss specific issues of concern to their members. All four support groups are funded by the Department to provide support services to their members, and to represent their members&rsquo; interests with service providers. I can assure the Deputy that the support groups do not hesitate to ensure that the concerns of their members are made known to myself, my Department, and to the service providers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply direct to him as a matter of urgency. I am aware that the authority is in the process of recruiting staff to re-open some long-stay beds which were closed due to difficulties in retaining appropriate staff. In addition, public private partnerships are also currently being piloted in the health sector. PPPs are based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units (CNUs) for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds, nine of which will be in the Dublin area with the remainder being located in the Southern Health Board area. The services offered in these units will include assessment/rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence. If the PPP pilots demonstrate success it is the intention to use PPP as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Under the acute hospital bed capacity initiative, my Department has also provided an additional &euro;8.8 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and &euro;3.8 million to the Southern Health Board to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting, thereby freeing up acute <Col N="1411"/>hospital beds. My Department has been informed by the authority that in excess of 200 patients in the acute hospital system in the eastern region have been moved to more appropriate accommodation in the private nursing home sector under this initiative.</P>

However, the RPA has assured me that it and the Luas contractors are committed to ensuring the safety of traffic management measures which must be put in place to facilitate Luas works.</P>
        <P>While the RPA regrets the inconvenience caused by the works in the Bluebell/Davitt Road area, it is working with contractors to ensure that work is completed as quickly as possible. It is assumed that the pedestrian lights referred to are those that were located at Bluebell Estate, opposite Lansdowne Park. The RPA has informed me that these lights were removed, with the agreement of Dublin City Council, for the duration of the works at that location as it was thought to be unsafe for people to cross the road at that point while construction is under way. The lights will be reinstated when these works have been completed, which is expected to be in May.</P>
        <P>The footpath from the entrance to the estate towards Davitt Road is scheduled to be reinstated fully within three weeks. More extensive work is required to reinstate the permanent footpath from the entrance to the estate towards Bluebell.

	<P>In accordance with a commitment under An Agreed Programme for Government, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 was enacted in July 2003 to provide a legislative basis for the establishment of a Commission for Taxi Regulation and an advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation. This legislation followed amending regulations made in 2002 to provide for the phased introduction of a taximeter printer requirement for taxis to issue printed fare receipts.</P>
        <P>The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 also facilitates the replacement of the current regulatory system applying to the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers, and the development, under the auspices of the <Col N="1420"/>Commission for Taxi Regulation, of new qualitative standards relating to the operation and driving of small public service vehicles.</P>
        <P>Following a competition for the post of Commissioner for Taxi Regulation in 2003, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission was unable to recommend a candidate for appointment. A further recruitment competition on the basis of an enhanced salary for the position is currently being progressed by the commission.</P>
        <P>With regard to the advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation, I have made an order under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 to provide for the establishment of the council with effect from 4 November 2003. The council consists of a chairperson and 17 ordinary members, appointed for a three year period, representing the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, consumer, disability, tourism and business interests and other relevant sectors, as required under the Act. The primary role of the council is to advise the commission, when established, and myself as Minister for Transport, as appropriate, in relation to issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. Pending the establishment of the commission, I have indicated that I am particularly interested in the advice of the council on issues relating to quality enhancement and standards for small public service vehicles and their drivers, including general vehicle condition and appearance, accessibility for persons with mobility and sensory difficulties, a standard vehicle colour for taxis and the introduction of enhanced training, including customer service training and disability awareness and knowledge requirements for existing and new small public service vehicle drivers.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Limited is proceeding with the processing and assessment of applications under the taxi hardship payments scheme which is implementing the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report in accordance with the relevant Government decision. I understand from ADM that hardship payments totalling &euro;3,988,000 have been made to 327 qualifying persons under the scheme to 5 March 2004. The time taken to process applications and to make payments depends on the completeness of the information and supporting documentation in each individual application. Newspaper advertisements were again placed in the national newspapers on 27 February 2004 inviting applications under the scheme and advising of a closing date of 30 April 2004 for receipt of applications.</P>

Letter of 25 November 2003 from the Minister for Transport to Mr. Gemelli, Chairman of the EU Committee advising him of recent developments relevant to the taxi industry, of the fact that the position is unchanged in that the Minister has no proposals to reopen either the terms of the Taxi Hardship Report or the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to it. The letter also advised the Committee of the position regarding the Taxi Hardship Payments Scheme, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, proposals for the Commission for Taxi Regulation, as well as the establishment of an Advisory Council to the Commission in November 2003.

The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The working group recommended that with the changeover to metric values that each speed limit sign should display the actual speed limit value in numerals together with the units &ldquo;kmh&rdquo; to clearly indicate that the value being displayed is metric. Recommendations were also made in relation to the sign face size to be deployed on the various classes of public road and in relation to speed limit repeater signage.</P>
        <?oasys _dc30-?><P>In addition, it was recommended that a regulatory basis be developed for the use of time-based speed limit signs, gantry mounted signs, on-road roundel signs and variable message signs to support the application of the new speed limit structure.</P>

	<P>In April 2000, the Government agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, to a system of delegated authority under which recruitment is carried out to maintain the strength of the force at an agreed level. In April 2002, the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the force by 200 to 12,200. A total of 690 Garda trainees were taken into the Garda college during 2003. The commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that the maximum <Col N="1428"/>authorised force strength of 12,200 will be achieved during 2004.</P>
        <P>In addition, the commissioner has projected that a total of 368 trainees are required to meet the demand created by compulsory retirements and projected voluntary retirements and other discharges for 2004. However, he cautions that all projections are based on variables and are therefore subject to change. The matter of voluntary retirements will be closely monitored, particularly in the early months of this year when historically a higher number of applications are received. At this stage it is not possible to indicate the number of trainees that will be required to recruited in 2005 to maintain the strength of the force at the approved level of 12,200.</P>

	<P>In order to be given permission to remain as an English language student in this jurisdiction the non-EEA national in question must be in a position to show that he or she is enrolled in a course that provides a minimum of 15 hours of tuition per week. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that study is the primary purpose of the person&rsquo;s presence in the State and that enrolment in the course in question is not simply a convenient device to enable the putative student to cloak his or her presence for an alternative purpose with the vestige of study.</P>
        <P>The school proprietor in question sought initially to arrange, for a fee, the presence of students in the State on the basis of four hours attendance per week &mdash; the remainder of the tuition to be done remotely via the Internet. The school was promoted on the basis that students would not even have to live near it. When asked why the students would have to go to the trouble <Col N="1429"/>and expense of travelling to and living in Ireland for the purposes of the e-learning scheme envisaged, the proprietor indicated that it was a necessary adjunct to the course that the students immerse themselves in the Irish way of life and practice speaking English in normal everyday situations.</P>
        <P>When it became clear to the proprietor that his scheme was not acceptable to the Department, he indicated instead that he would now in fact provide courses which cohered with the Department&rsquo;s general rule &mdash; that is physical attendance for 15 hours per week. The Department agreed to this arrangement provided that the Garda national immigration bureau was satisfied, on foot of a visit to the school, that reasonable facilities were in place which would support an objective conclusion that the stated policy of the school was in fact its true policy.</P>
        <P>To date, the proprietor has been unable to satisfy the Garda national immigration bureau to that effect. I should point out in this regard that it is not the policy of the Department to enable a school to operate in a manner which is unacceptable in order to acquire the necessary finance to comply with Department requirements &mdash; every undertaking of this nature needs an adequate amount of capital investment at the outset.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State in September 2002 and made an asylum application. His wife had arrived in the State in July 2002, gave birth six days later and made an application for asylum in August 2002. Both subsequently withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of the Irish child born.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to <Col N="1432"/>reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.

        <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport him. If, in the light of representations received, which can include mention of his missionary work and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order, he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy. I understand that the figure of 96,000 referred to in the report was the number of drivers who have been notified by the Department of Transport of the entry of penalty points on their licence record. It does not refer to the numbers of speeding detections by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a person detected speeding can opt either to pay the fixed charge and accept two penalty points or to contest the charge in court and risk a fine of up to &euro;800 and four penalty points.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the main objective of Garda activity in the area of road safety is to change road user behaviour, through enforcement and surveillance, ultimately leading to a reduction of the numbers killed and injured on our roads annually. The effectiveness of Garda activity should therefore be judged on the basis of the numbers killed and injured, not on the number of speeding detections <i>per se</i>. The Garda authorities have assured me that their experience is that driver behaviour is changing since the introduction of the penalty points system.</P>
        <P>While the Garda figures for 2003 have not yet been validated, I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures indicate that approximately 250,000 drivers were detected speeding last year. While this represents an approximately 25% drop in the number of speed detections in 2002, it is consistent with the <Col N="1433"/>reduction noted last year in the number of insurance claims and the substantial drop in serious injuries, spinal injuries and admissions to accident and emergency departments in hospitals.</P>
        <P>In addition, the number of road fatalities for 2003 show that 36 fewer people died on our roads than in the previous year. This represents a decrease in road fatalities of 9.6% on the number of fatalities in 2002 and of 27.5% on the 1997 figure. While recent tragedies show that we cannot afford to be complacent, the consistent decline in the number of road fatalities and injuries for each year since 1997 indicates the result of the effective traffic policing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, more recently, a marked change in driver behaviour since the introduction of penalty points. It has long been anticipated that an improvement in motorist behaviour would result in a decline in the number of detections in respect of speeding and other offences.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their support. Applications will normally have been made as a result of representations from groups forming residential, commercial and local government interests, and would be expected to contain the location and scope of the cameras required. Applications are then submitted to the CCTV advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters regarding CCTV systems, for consideration and assessment.</P>
        <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime and public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity in the area; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances or needs that exist in the area; and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system in the area.</P><Col N="1435"/>
        <P>The advisory committee then makes a recommendation on each application to the Garda Commissioner, who in turn makes a recommendation on each application to myself. A final decision on whether to approve a new Garda CCTV system will depend on the availability of funds and the programme of CCTV work to be completed.</P>
        <P>It is not, understandably, possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for CCTV systems received by the CCTV advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. To this end, a grant-aid scheme has been launched to facilitate community-based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from the Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority to install, maintain and monitor the community-based CCTV schemes.</P>
        <P>An application prospectus has been prepared by the Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from my Department&rsquo;s Garda administration division. A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and detailed technical specifications drawn up by The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised the Department will issue copies of same to all communities who expressed an interest in the community-based CCTV scheme and any application subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.</P>

	<P>The Curragh Place of Detention closed on 20 January 2004. The <Col N="1437"/>majority of the prisoners detained there were transferred to the Midlands Prison at that time. Most of the Irish Prison Service staff who were assigned to the Curragh have been temporarily redeployed to duties in the Midlands Prison and one prison officer was temporarily redeployed to Limerick Prison. Arrangements whereby a small cohort of prison staff continue to be assigned to duties at the Curragh Prison are being kept under continuing review.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the staff of the education unit of the Curragh Place of Detention, who are employed by County Kildare VEC, have continued to report there pending the outcome of negotiations on terms and conditions of teacher secondments to the Midlands Prison. It is hoped that both these negotiations and the fitting out of additional classrooms at the Midlands Prison will be completed shortly to enable education to be provided for prisoners transferred from the Curragh.</P>

Should an application be received, the committee will decide on this application and make a recommendation to the commissioner who in turn will make his recommendation known to myself.</P>
        <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity in the area; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances or needs that exist in the area; the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system in the area.</P>

	<P>A total of 17 locations are set to receive new Garda CCTV systems subject, of course, to the availability of funds. These locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, <Col N="1438"/>Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
        <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters regarding CCTV systems, on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances or needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system in the area. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
        <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their support. Applications will normally have been made as a result of representations from groups forming residential, commercial and local government interests and would be expected to contain the location and scope of the cameras required.</P>
        <P>Some applications for CCTV systems received by the CCTV advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. To this end, a grant-aid scheme has been launched to facilitate community based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the garda&iacute; will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it.</P>
        <P>The Department has received a significant number of expressions of interest &mdash; in excess of 200 &mdash; in the community based CCTV scheme. An application prospectus has been prepared by the Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from my Department&rsquo;s Garda administration division. A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised, my <Col N="1439"/>Department will issue copies of same to all communities who expressed an interest in the community based CCTV scheme and any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>if an appeal for a visa application for a person (details supplied) will be given in view of the fact that a similar visa has previously been issued by other countries, including member countries of the European Union, that all considerations have been complied with in the past, and that there are humanitarian considerations involved.</Quest>
        <QRef>[7842/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The visa application in question was received by my Department on 20 November 2003. The application was supported by an employment permit for employment as a childminder for a five month period from 18 September 2003 to 17 February 2004.</P>
        <P>In assessing a visa application a visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of remaining in the State. Credibility is central to the visa determination process. The visa officer, in considering the application in question, noted that almost half of the validity period of the five month employment permit had expired. The applicant had not shown any significant ties to her country of origin, Equatorial Guinea. It was also noted that the applicant intended to bring her son with her. In the case of visa required nationals who enter the State on foot of an employment permit, it is only after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered a contract for a further 12 months that they may be joined by their family. In the circumstances, the visa officer formed the opinion that it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the applicant would not observe the conditions attached to the visa and the application was refused. In that context, account was taken of the fact that the applicant is, in fact, the sister-in-law of the employer in Ireland and that the employer had supported the mother and child in Equatorial Guinea.</P>
        <P>An appeal against the refusal was received but the visa appeals officer, having reconsidered the application afresh, upheld the original decision. It is, of course, open to the applicant to make a fresh application with up to date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.</P>

	<P>Ballyfermot is one of 17 locations which are set to receive a new Garda town centre CCTV system, subject to the availability of funds. The other locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 of the scheme comprises Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Work on the implementation of these systems is ongoing at present.</P><P>Phase 2 of the scheme comprises Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford. The pre-tender process for these systems is at an advanced stage. Request for tender and detailed technical specification documents are currently being drafted by the telecommunications section at Garda headquarters, having regard to experience with other Garda CCTV systems and technological developments in this field. I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is intended to seek tenders for these systems within the first half of 2004.</P>
        <P>Phase 3 of the scheme will consist of a further seven areas &mdash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. The planning for the installation of these systems is scheduled to commence later this year. I have been informed that the planning stage includes identifying the proposed camera locations and as such it is not possible, at this point in time, to provide the Deputy with the specific number or location of these cameras.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, that the table set out hereunder indicates the number, types and ages of vehicles attached to stations in the DMR. Ages of vehicles will not necessarily conform exactly with the registration number as ages are calculated from the date on which the vehicle is commissioned for operational service. Based on average mileages and taking into account accidents and malicious damage, it is expected that between approximately 120 and 140 vehicles attached to stations in the DMR. will be replaced this year.</P><Col N="1441"/>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, that the details contained in the tables set out hereunder outline the types and ages of the entire fleet together with the book value for these vehicles. The book value is the written down value in accordance with Government accounting procedures. This <Col N="1444"/>refers to the practice of writing off 20% of the value per year.</P>
        <P>Ages of vehicles will not necessarily conform exactly to the registration number as ages are calculated from the date on which the vehicle is commissioned for operational service and is also the date on which warranty commences. On average, between 400 and 500 vehicles will require replacement each year. Based on current mileages and the average cost per vehicle for 2003 being &euro;19,500, the cost of fleet replacement is estimated at between &euro;8.5 million and &euro;9.5 million per annum. However, this figure does not take account of special circumstances or the need for specialist vehicles that may arise from time to time.</P></Speaker><Col N="1445"/>

	<P>There is a wide range of vehicles in use in the various prisons, places of detention and related bodies within the Irish Prison Service. These include plant and machinery used for various duties within the prison system.</P>
        <P>The following is a breakdown of the different categories of vehicle currently in the Irish prison system: cellular vans &mdash; two; minibuses &mdash; 44; cars + MPV &mdash; 39; vans &mdash; 36; refrigerated vans &mdash; seven; forklifts &mdash; 12; hoists &mdash; 15; lawn maintenance &mdash; 12; trucks &mdash; three; pick-up trucks &mdash; five; builders&rsquo; dumpers &mdash; ten; tractors &mdash; ten; total &mdash; 195 vehicles. The 195 vehicles that are in service at present are of various ages and are generally replaced after ten years of service or earlier if the mileage is considered excessive.</P>
        <P>The cost of replacing vehicles changes from year to year depending on the type of vehicle and the number of vehicles that reach the ten year limit in each given year. New vehicles are purchased through a Government supplies agency tender process. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the replacement cost of the fleet of vehicles in use by the Prison Service. I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that the information about the age of the vehicles, requested by the Deputy, can be obtained in most cases but will take further time to compile. I will write to the Deputy as soon as the information becomes available.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of road traffic signs on non-national roads. However, in line with a commitment in the programme for Government to put in place a new five year plan to ensure that non-national roads are properly signposted, my Department introduced a new regional roads signposting programme for non-national roads in 2003. This year a sum of &euro;5 million has been provided for this programme and allocations have been made available to 12 local authorities for the provision of road traffic directional signs on non-national roads.</P>
        <P>This new programme is confined to the provision of road traffic signs and does not extend to heritage signs, which are managed and erected independently by the heritage service of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has not carried out a national survey of deer numbers in Ireland. However, the extent of woodland habitat continues to increase as a consequence of public and private afforestation. Assessments by Coillte, the country&rsquo;s largest owner and manager of woodland, suggest that the distribution of deer has expanded in recent years so it is likely that the population has also increased.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department carries out localised annual counts of deer populations on lands managed by the Department. Depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls are carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach unsustainable levels that would have negative ecological consequences. Where deer are causing damage on private property, landowners may apply to my Department for licences under the Wildlife Acts to control the animals, when this is necessary outside the annual open seasons for deer shooting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines for planning authorities on retail planning published in December 2000 took full account of international experience, both in Britain and across Europe. One of the major policy objectives of the guidelines is to support the continuing role of town and district centres.</P>
        <P>The guidelines explicitly state that the preferred location for retail development should be within town centres, consistent with the requirement to achieve good access, especially by public transport. The economic analysis undertaken in the course of the preparation of the guidelines supported this view and indicated that the closure of small local shops has undesirable effects in terms of dereliction, urban blight, reduction in town centre activity and a general depreciation in the attractiveness of town centre environments. The guidelines note that <Col N="1455"/>shopping provision is a key aspect of town centres and that it makes a major contribution to their vitality and viability. Planning authorities are advised in the guidelines to adopt a proactive role in enhancing the vitality and viability of their centres.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the retail planning guidelines are working well in achieving their objective of maintaining the vitality and viability of town and district centres. I have no plans to review these aspects of the guidelines. However, the floor space cap on retail warehouses contained in the guidelines is currently under review and I expect that this review will be finalised shortly.</P>

	<P>The electronic voting machine supplied following the competitive tendering process contains a designated port to receive a unit to enable the visually impaired to vote independently. None of the companies that submitted tenders was in a position to supply such a unit in the short term.</P>
        <P>At my Department&rsquo;s request, the chosen suppliers have undertaken initial work on developing a facility for future use whereby visually impaired voters, who would otherwise require assistance to vote, will be able to use the new voting system independently. My Department will consult with the National Disability Authority and the National Council for the Blind, which have already provided constructive input into improvements made to the voting machine, about the development of this voting machine feature.</P>
        <P>Since its first use in 2002, a number of improvements have already been made to the voting machine to improve its user friendliness <Col N="1457"/>for the visually impaired and other users. The new features include an increase in the size and legibility of candidate details, the use of larger preference numbers and brighter displays for better visibility and the use of a redesigned &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; button.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427 and 428 together.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously that I am unhappy with certain aspects of the RAPID programme. In this context, I have been examining the manner in which the programme operates and envisage that in future the programme will operate on a number of levels in tandem. In the first instance, there are many small scale proposals from RAPID plans that have been sent unnecessarily to Departments for consideration when they could be dealt with more effectively at local level. <Col N="1458"/>I propose to introduce a new additional delivery mechanism to progress such actions, supported by funding under a new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million that has been set aside for capital expenditure in 2004. These projects will be co-funded by the relevant public body/local agency under a number of categories, with levels of funding agreed at national level. I have been meeting my ministerial colleagues to agree the details of the measures to be funded and I intend to make a formal announcement shortly regarding the precise details of the operation of this fund.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that Departments will continue to consider larger projects from RAPID plans for allocations from funding streams within each Department. Departments will be dealing with a smaller number of projects and will, therefore, be in a better position to prioritise projects and to set out timescales for further actions. Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue, as this is an important component of the RAPID programme. The national monitoring committee for the RAPID programme monitors the programme at national level and I have taken on the role as chair of this committee.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the different levels of progress across RAPID areas and of issues with progress in Dublin city generally. ADM, which manages the programme on behalf of my Department, has had discussions on the matter recently with Dublin City Council city development board. It should be noted that local personnel issues are a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>

        <P>My Department administers the community development programme which provides core funding to voluntary groups to empower local communities to address the issues that affect them. A sum of &euro;20.6 million has been allocated to this programme in 2004. The total expenditure on the programme to date is &euro;4.375 million. My Department also administers the scheme for the reintegration of ex-prisoners and &euro;0.136 million has been allocated to this scheme in 2004. Total expenditure to date is &euro;0.034 million.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;8.59 million, &euro;2.148 million from the Exchequer, has been allocated to the administration of the PEACE II programme in 2004. The programme is administered by the Combat Poverty Agency in Monaghan on behalf of my Department. To date a total of &euro;2.05 million, &euro;0.5 million from Exchequer, has been allocated to the Combat Poverty Agency. My Department administers funding under the programme for support for national anti-poverty networks. A sum of &euro;1,430,650 has been allocated under this scheme in 2004. The total expenditure on the scheme to date is &euro;643,792. My Department is also responsible for grants entitled &ldquo;funding to support volunteering&rdquo;. A sum of &euro;271,998 has been allocated under this scheme in 2004. The total expenditure on the scheme to date is &euro;98,739.</P>
        <P>There is provision of &euro;42.144 million in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for the local development <Col N="1460"/>social inclusion programme, LDSIP, which aims to promote social inclusion. Funding is allocated to partnerships and community groups and territorial employment pacts to deliver the local development social inclusion programme under three measures &mdash; services for the unemployed, community based youth initiatives and community development. Area Development Management Limited manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of my Department and &euro;9.438 million has been expended by my Department to end of February.</P>
        <P>A new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million capital funding is being made available in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2004 to support small scale localised actions in RAPID areas through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. I propose to announce full details of how this money will be spent shortly.</P>
        <P>There is an amount of &euro;10.615 million provided for the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. This aims to address the legacy of conflict and to take opportunities arising from peace through developing measures that focus on the following priorities: economic renewal, social integration, inclusion and reconciliation and cross-Border co-operation. The programme operates in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland &mdash; Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, Sligo &mdash; and is managed by ADM/CPA on behalf of the Department. A total of &euro;2.4 million has been drawn down to date in 2004 to facilitate payments to projects.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;26.756 million has been has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for expenditure in the drugs area in 2004. This funding will primarily be spent on projects and initiatives funded through the local drugs task forces and the young persons facilities and services fund, YPFSF. Total expenditure to date in 2004 amounts to &euro;1.045 million.</P>
        <P>Funding of almost &euro;150 million has been allocated to 38 local action groups countrywide under the Leader programmes for the period 2000-2006: Leader+, &euro;73.6 million, and national rural development programme, &euro;75.7 million. Funding is available to both private promoters and community groups through the local action groups for innovative rural enterprise projects, agricultural and fishery related projects, social and cultural projects and small scale environmentally friendly initiatives. The decision making process for the allocation of funding to promoters is devolved to the boards of each local action group. Funding of &euro;21.27 million &mdash; Leader+ &euro;11.812 million and NRDP &euro;9.460 million &mdash; has been allocated for 2004. Expenditure to date in 2004 totals &euro;2,666,780.</P>
        <P>The areas targeted under the CL&Aacute;R programme will continue to benefit from <Col N="1461"/>assistance in 2004 under the range of measures operated. These areas are parts of Counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath and all of County Leitrim. Measures with a particular community focus are the group water scheme and group sewerage schemes. CL&Aacute;R provides funding, through the local authority, to householders in the group schemes by way of limited top up grants. As these schemes are demand led, there is no specific allocation. To date in 2004, approximately &euro;380,000 of CL&Aacute;R funding for six schemes has been approved. Community based projects attracting less than 50% public funding under Leader may qualify for CL&Aacute;R top up funding subject to the certain conditions. As this scheme is demand led, there is no specific allocation. To date in 2004, approximately &euro;254,000 of CL&Aacute;R funding for five projects has been approved.</P>
        <P>The provision for the rural development fund in the Vote in my Department this year is &euro;950,000. The purpose of the fund is to finance research, evaluation and pilot actions to provide information and advice for policy makers on important rural development issues. I am supporting a number of pilot actions in rural areas this year. The groups being supported are Foscadh Community Development, Inishowen Rural Development Limited, Inishowen Partnership, Sneen, Castlecove, Caherdaniel Integrated Resource Development, the Western Development Tourism Programme, Galway East Tourism Marketing, South Kerry Tourism, the Countryside Council or Comhairle na Tuaithe and Laois Rural Employment Partnership. Expenditure to date in 2004 totals &euro;16,220. Arrangements for the fund are currently under review.</P>
        <P>Financial support has been provided to various community groups in the Gaeltacht under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht schemes. This funding is provided to improve the economic, social and physical conditions in the Gaeltacht and to strengthen the Irish language as the principal community language in the region. Grants approved by me to date in 2004 total &euro;415,000.</P>

        <P>I am at present preparing detailed proposals for a rural social scheme arising from the announcement of the scheme in the context of budget 2004. Detailed guidelines for the scheme, including objectives, criteria for participation, the way it will operate and how it will be delivered at a local level are currently under consideration by my Department.</P>
        <P>In order to strengthen the future economic viability of island communities, my Department is actively pursuing the introduction of an enterprise fund for non-Gaeltacht islands. This fund will be directed at assisting entrepreneurs to create new employment opportunities in island settings where, traditionally, communities have had to depend on tourism in addition to small scale farming and fishing to make a living. I hope to be in a position to announce details of the scheme shortly.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Gaeltacht, my Department is continuing to study the recommendations made in the report of Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta 2002 and new initiatives as necessary may be brought forward in due course. There is an amount of &euro;10.615 million provided for the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, which aims to address the legacy of conflict and to take opportunities arising from peace through developing measures that focus, from this Departments perspective, on the following priorities: economic renewal, social integration, inclusion and reconciliation and cross-Border co-operation. The programme operates in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland &mdash; Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, Sligo &mdash; and is managed by ADM/CPA on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>A new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million capital funding is being made available in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2004, to support small scale localised actions in RAPID areas, through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. I propose to announce full details of arrangements.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the extent to which he intends to support urban and rural communities negatively affected by demographic trends; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>A sum of &euro;21 million has been allocated to the community development support programmes, CDSPs, in 2004 to support locally based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives. Projects have been initiated in areas identified as meeting the disadvantage and social exclusion criteria for the programme. In this context, due regard is had to the demographic <Col N="1463"/>profile of the area, including factors such as population decline, when selecting areas for inclusion. The total number of projects supported under the programme is currently 174, of which 52 projects are in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties have been selected under this programme. These areas suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas that I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure through a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or public utilities, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and impact as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>
        <P>The Leader programmes are innovative EU programmes put in place to encourage the implementation of integrated, high quality strategies in rural communities with particular emphasis on community type projects. The programmes do not specifically target rural communities negatively affected by demographic trends. However, through implementing its actions to support rural communities the programme has a positive affect on these areas. The offshore islands have also been adversely affected by demographic trends and show an approximate decline of 5% over the last two censuses. A provision of &euro;13 million is included in my Department&rsquo;s 2004 Estimates for current and capital expenditure on islands to help tackle this trend.</P>
        <P>The Irish speaking population has reduced from 76.3% to 72.6% of the overall Gaeltacht population, according to the last two censuses. My Department will seek to address this negative trend through the provision of &euro;32.193 million funding to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2004. This is in addition to the funding provided through schemes directly administered by the Department. These measures critically serve to support the physical and economic development of the Gaeltacht as well as promoting linguistic, cultural and social development.</P>
        <P>Finally an amount of &euro;10.615 million is being provided for the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, which aims to address the legacy of conflict and to take opportunities arising from <Col N="1464"/>peace. It does this through developing measures that focus on the following priorities: economic renewal, social integration, inclusion and reconciliation and cross-Border co-operation. The programme operates in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland, that is, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. It is managed by ADM/CPA on behalf of my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 435 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, as well as the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, YPFSF.</P>
        <P>The role of the LDTFs is to prepare local action plans which include a range of measures for treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services. They are designed to complement and add value to the extensive range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies. The main aim of the YPFSF is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The fund operates in the 14 LDTF areas as well as four other urban centres &mdash; Galway, Limerick, Carlow and Waterford.</P>
        <P>To date over &euro;65 million has been allocated or spent to implement the various projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the <Col N="1465"/>LDTFs. A further &euro;11.5 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects and approximately &euro;68 million has been allocated or spent under the first round of funding under the YPFSF. In this context, I hope to make announcements about round II allocations in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that under the national drugs strategy, regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, have been established in the ten health board regions. The RDTFs are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the range and level of existing services, with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision.</P>

        <Quest>if she will further review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Louth who was in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit, in view of the fact that she remains eligible for this payment.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned was awarded a deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit in January 1996. She continued to receive this payment until her claim was terminated in September 1998. There is no record of her making contact with my Department until a letter in September 2002 requesting that her deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit be reinstated.</P>
        <P>Deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit ceased for new applicants and re-applications with effect from 2 January 1997, when one-parent family payment was introduced. Accordingly, her request could only be treated as an application for one-parent family payment. This application was refused on the grounds that she did not have a qualified child dependant, one of the qualifying conditions for one-parent family payment. A subsequent review of her case found that there were no grounds for a change of this position.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions about claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned made a claim for maternity benefit on 12 December 2003 in respect of her maternity leave, which commenced on 23 February 2004. Based on her social insurance record and the information supplied with her application form, the person concerned could qualify for payment of maternity benefit at the weekly rate of &euro;151.60.</P>
        <P>However, she is already in receipt of a one parent family payment at the rate of &euro;154.10 per week. Under existing regulations a person cannot receive both payments concurrently. Accordingly, one parent family payment remains in payment to the person concerned. Under social welfare legislation decisions about claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has been refused a rent allowance by the Southern Health Board on the grounds that the rent is too high.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have recently introduced a number of changes to the rent supplement scheme. The principal change is that, with certain important exceptions, new applicants are required, at the time of application, to have been in rented accommodation for at least six months within the preceding 12 month period to receive a rent supplement. Specific provision has been made to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities are fully protected in the course of implementing the new measures. In addition, anyone who is assessed by a housing authority as having a housing need and who meets the existing qualifying criteria will continue to be entitled to rent supplement.</P>
        <P>The Southern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that he failed to satisfy the board that he had been in rented accommodation for six months. In addition, his accommodation needs had not been assessed by the housing authority. He was advised to contact the housing authority to have his housing needs assessed. The board offered to arrange temporary emergency accommodation while the housing assessment was carried out but this offer was refused.</P>
        <P>The board has further advised that it contacted the housing authority and was told that the person concerned is not willing to provide details of his current address so that an assessment of his <Col N="1467"/>housing needs can be made. If the information is provided and the assessment is carried out, rent supplement may be payable, subject to the normal qualifying criteria, if he is assessed as having a housing need which the housing authority cannot meet.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if her Department has plans to increase the earnings limit for persons in receipt of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit where the claim was made on or after 31 August 1992; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where claims for deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit were made on or after 31 August 1992, the earnings limit for entitlement to benefit is &euro;12,697.38 per year gross earnings. However, where earnings are in excess of this amount there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment provided earnings do not exceed &euro;17,776.33 per year gross.</P>
        <P>Deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit was closed to new applicants from 2 January 1997 when the one-parent family payment was introduced. The concept of desertion no longer exists in the social welfare code and deserted wives who have dependent children are treated in the same manner as all other lone parents with children. Under the one-parent family payment scheme, lone parents are encouraged to maximise their income from different sources and the means test <Col N="1468"/>for this scheme makes provision for the exemption of earnings and maintenance payments. With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of &euro;293 per week. Lone parents are also eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>At present, the social welfare arrangements in place for lone parents are appropriate and support the general policy, which is to provide income support for lone parents while at the same time encouraging them to consider employment as a realistic alternative. The position is being kept under review and any changes would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
