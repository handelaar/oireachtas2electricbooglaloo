   <Title>Request to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the matter of 40 redundancies at the Dubarry shoe factory in Ballinasloe, County Galway, last week and to ask the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if he is aware that no new industrial jobs have been created in Ballinasloe to replace the more than 1,000 jobs lost in that area over the past three or four years. That is the first request to the Minister and I hope he will do more in this regard than did the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 on the following matter of urgent public concern, namely, the refusal of the Department of Education and Science to grant co-operation hours for practical subject teachers of an additional four hours and 45 minutes per day to St. Brighid&rsquo;s special secondary school in Dundalk and the crisis currently pertaining at the school where as a consequence of this refusal students with disabilities are only getting practical subject input on a week on week off basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, the issue of the number and conditions of prisoners being held in Iraq, its relevance to the position of Ken Bigley who is being held as a hostage and the initiatives the Irish Government proposes to take.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to raise a matter of crucial national importance, namely, the proposals by Aer Lingus man<Col N="642"/>agement to destroy 1,300 jobs in the national airline; the potential major conflict of interest involving the senior management of Aer Lingus, who while charged with protecting the interests of the taxpayer in a publicly owned company, are planning its privatisation; the decision by the company management to cease taking home human remains following the death of citizens abroad and to discuss the damaging consequences of the Government&rsquo;s neo-liberal economic policies responsible for the threatened destruction of the airline.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to go beyond the statement submitted to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek permission to suspend business under Standing Order 31 to discuss the Government&rsquo;s ongoing failure to commence work on the new Cork School of Music and to allow the new Minister &mdash; maybe it will be a case of third time lucky because three Ministers will have been dealing with this matter &mdash; an opportunity to present to the House all the details regarding the Government&rsquo;s dealings with Jarvis Development who were the proposed developers for that project.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 on the following important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reverse his deportation policy and keep his promise made to the parties at the first briefing on the citizenship referendum, that he would move to regularise the situation of approximately 11,000 families with children who are Irish citizens who face either separation from their parents or effective exile as a result of Government policy. This would bring Irish policy into line with our European partners with respect to the obligation to uphold children&rsquo;s rights to the care and company of their parents, enshrined in the international convention on the rights of the child, as outlined by the Advocate General in the Chen case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate an issue of national importance, namely, the appalling condition of many of our primary and secondary schools, including those in areas of rapid expansion such as St. Mary&rsquo;s junior and senior schools in Rowlagh and St. Bernadette&rsquo;s junior and senior schools in Quarryvale. These schools were poorly designed in the 1970s and now suffer from ongoing vandalism and flooding due to the design and condition of their roofs. The schools are currently in a departmental limbo despite the recognised urgent need to replace the roofs in all four schools simultaneously. The situation is a sad reflection of the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment to education, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="643"/>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to allow the Government to elaborate on the reported assurances which, it claims, were given that a flotilla of weapons-grade plutonium travelling from the USA to Cherbourg in France will not pass through Irish waters, and to clarify if this assurance is in writing and if it refers to the 12-mile, 50-mile or 200-mile limit off the coast; and to state what contingency plan is in place in the event of an accident or terrorist attack on this highly dangerous cargo.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order in accordance with Standing Order 31.</P>

   <Title>Appointment of Ministers and Ministers of State: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to formally announce, for the information of the D&aacute;il that, having informed the President that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had approved my nomination of Deputies Hanafin, O&rsquo;Dea and Roche to be members of the Government, the President, on 29 September 2004, appointed them accordingly.</P>
    <P>On the same day, I assigned the Department of Health and Children to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney; the Department of Finance to Deputy Cowen; the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Deputy Noel Dempsey; the Department Foreign Affairs to Deputy Dermot Ahern; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Deputy Martin; the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Deputy Brennan; the Department of Transport to Deputy Cullen; the Department of Agriculture and Food to Deputy Coughlan; the Department Education and Science to Deputy Hanafin; the Department of Defence to Deputy O&rsquo;Dea; and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Deputy Roche.</P>
    <P>On the same date, the Government appointed Deputy Kitt to be Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence; Deputy Fahey to be Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Deputy Gallagher to be Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; Deputy Browne to be Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food; Deputy Callely to be Minister of State at the Department of Transport; Deputy Treacy to be Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs; Deputy Se&aacute;n Power to be Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children; Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe to be Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Deputy Killeen to be Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Deputy Brendan Smith to be Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food; and <Col N="644"/>Deputy Conor Lenihan to be Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 1, Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage; and Private Members&rsquo; Business No. 30, Enforcement of Court Orders Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken immediately after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a bit concerned for your own safety, a Cheann Comhairle, when I see the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, sitting high on the backbenches telling us that he will be hanging around for a while longer. I do not know whether you heard that remark or whether there is any significance in it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It could arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not going to leave a convivial party until it closes down.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I got a medical as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe he should keep in touch with Deputy Rabbitte and myself on a more regular basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be in opposition for a long time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the ministerial appointments and divisions of responsibility that the Taoiseach announced yesterday, is there any Minister of State with specific responsibility for a ministerial task force on drugs? The country is now facing a serious problem in this area. Deputy Rabbitte was previously the chairman of a committee which did very good work. Such a ministerial task force is needed again.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not feel somewhat uneasy about the fact that he has a senior Minister in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who admitted that he does not know what is happening in terms of penalty points and speeding cameras? He was unaware that half the cameras were not working and that many of the pictures could not be used.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question does not arise on the Order of Business. I will allow the first question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach not think that, to put it mildly, it undermines confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, when hundreds of people die on the roads each year, yet he admits he is unaware of these facts, <Col N="645"/>which were raised by Deputy Naughten the other day?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to find another way of raising that matter. Does Deputy Rabbitte want to come in on the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, sir.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach wants to answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s first question, the national drugs strategy and the entire drugs plan is under the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The brother.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but the departmental team that deals with this is the committee on social inclusion, which I chair. There are about five or six Ministers on it. It is a cross-departmental committee, including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That is how the Government has operated this for the last seven years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to get the new parliamentary year off to a good start I want to assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that if you hear reports that I am taking a quiet drink with the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, in the Members&rsquo; bar, I do not want you to presume that I am taking sides.</P>
    <P>When is it proposed to bring the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulation 2004 before the House? This was on the Order Paper yesterday and it provides for an increase in the fund for horse racing from &euro;200 million to &euro;550 million. I am sure there must be an explanation for it. Perhaps the Taoiseach can provide that explanation and tell us when the order will come before the House.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the Bill to revise the constituency boundaries is not on the list of legislation either for this term or this parliamentary year? It is promised that it may be published in 2005 but one hears several of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s backbenchers, who are likely to be affected, expressing conditional wonderment about whether it will ever be enacted in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin North-Central is perfect. The Taoiseach should leave it as it is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In spite of Deputy Finian McGrath pleading to leave the constituency as it is, I have said before and will now restate that it will be enacted as is. There has been a practice for 25 years of taking the independent commission&rsquo;s report and enacting the changes. I am not sure why the Bill is not being put forward but I do not read any more into it than that. There will be no changes to it, I have made that clear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="646"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very simple one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good question. We can bring it forward and pass it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other matter, I do not know if the horse and greyhound regulations have been laid before the House. I will communicate with Deputy Rabbitte about that issue. This revolving fund is examined annually. The regulations were cleared by the Government some time ago, but I am not certain whether they have been laid before the House. I will check that for the Deputy. The scheme for the next year has already been cleared by the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that it takes a positive vote of the House. I am trying to establish what is likely to happen and why we should want to increase betting tax for horse racing from &euro;200 million to allow up to a facility of &euro;550 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise at this stage. It will arise when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I clarified for Deputy Rabbitte when it will come before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish all the Ministers of State and the new Cabinet members well in their new positions.</P>
    <P>Before getting down to the specifics of the issues on promised legislation, what is the basis for the promised programme of legislation? Some 19 Bills on the Easter list were promised for 2004 and are now scheduled for 2005. Nine of these were originally promised for 2003. Six of the Bills promised on the Easter list to be published by the start of the session are still not published. These are supposed to be indications in writing of publication dates. We do not yet have the Abbotstown sports centre authority Bill, the veterinary medicine Bill, the employment permits Bill, the health and social care professions regulatory Bill, the building societies amendment Bill and the prisons Bill. Yesterday the citizenship BilI was published. In the context of the employment permits Bill, I am concerned that those who want to work and are in a position to work are frustrated by not being able to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the contents of what might be in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to know what the Government&rsquo;s priorities are, whether that legislation is effectively sidelined, never to be seen, whether these lists have any meaning and what is the real meaning behind them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of the Bills referred to by Deputy Sargent are on the list for this session. <Col N="647"/>The exception is the prisons Bill, which is not on the list for this session. The legislation put forward for between now and Christmas are Bills the Government hopes to pass in consultation with the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel. The Departments hope to present those Bills. The House is passing more legislation that it ever did. Each year this increases. There is only a certain amount of parliamentary time. It is an indicative list, but we hope the Bills listed for this session will be dealt with in the session.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach not learned not to make promises he cannot keep?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>When is the safety, health and welfare at work Bill likely to be introduced in the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is already published. It is ordered for Second Stage and I am sure the Whips will shortly bring it forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not on the priority list.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is already published.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that. When will it come before the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Whips but it is ready to come before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>With the abolition of the health boards, there is practically no accountability or possibility of scrutiny in the health service. Given that a major health Bill will come before the House, will the Taoiseach guarantee that a sufficient period will be allowed between its publication and the debate in this House, so both the public and the public representatives will have an opportunity to debate fully the implications of the Bill? The Hanly report required the closure of many accident and emergency departments throughout the country. That was Government policy, even though at the last election it appeared to be changed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should put a question on legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that there is a new Minister for Health and Children, what is Government policy on the Hanly report?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, as you quite rightly addressed your question to the Minister for Health and Children, I suggest you submit a question to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to ask about the Hanly report.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="648"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in saying the health Bill is very important. We will try to provide as much time as possible. As the Deputy will be aware, it is important to try to pass the Bill during this session so we can put in place a number of procedures on 1 January 2005. I have noted and the T&aacute;naiste has heard what the Deputy said about adequate time to debate the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, will you explain to the House the order in which you call Deputies who indicate that they wish to contribute on the Order of Business? Two Deputies on the backbenches have been indicating that they wish to speak before people on the front benches but they have not been called. Will you explain to the House how you call people on the Order of Business? Are you trying to suppress the minority vote in this House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy will resume his seat, I will explain to him quite simply how I call people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is plenty of room for people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must resume his seat and he will be called in due course.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair calls the leaders of the parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the Ceann Comhairle should explain how he calls people who indicate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair was in the process of explaining the procedure to the Deputy when he continued to interrupt. Quite simply, the Chair calls the leaders of the parties in proportion to their size. The Chair calls in rotation someone from the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the smaller parties and the Independents. It is quite simple and it has been the same for the last seven years. On the basis of proportionality, the Chair is obliged to call more speakers from the larger parties than from the Independents. Sorry about that, Deputy Breen. I call Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>You will not get rid of Independent Deputies. We will let the electorate decide that, not the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Taoiseach promised me across the floor of the D&aacute;il before the summer recess that there would be no decision on the management proposal to privatise Aer Lingus until the Cabinet sub-committee set up to examine the issue reported to the D&aacute;il and there was an opportunity to discuss it. When will the committee report and when will the D&aacute;il have an opportunity to discuss the matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that the Deputy submits his question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is the Taoiseach satisfied that the national airline should be ceasing to return human remains?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other ways in which the Deputy can raise the matter.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no decision to privatise, sell or change regarding the issue raised by the Deputy. I said that any legislation in this regard will be brought before the House, but there is no decision to do any of these things.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the refusal to carry human remains?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach give a date for a Bill which appears to be on the Order Paper as long as I have been a Deputy concerning the register for persons who are considered unsafe to work with children? This urgent legislation has been dragging on for a long time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no fixed date on the legislation. A cross-departmental working group was established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider proposals for reform of vetting of employees by the Garda. The final meeting of the group has taken place and a report is being presented to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who are now considering its publication. Its publication is dependent on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

	<P>In order to be of assistance, perhaps the Taoiseach might like to clarify section C of the list of proposed legislation. There are no less than 70 pieces of legislation listed, the heads of which have yet to be approved by Government. In some cases, the heads have been prepared but have not yet come before Government. There is no year in which 70 pieces of legislation have gone past that particular point. What is the point of section C? My point, which I make to be of assistance, is that all are listed for publication during 2005. Perhaps three are suggested for early 2005. This means that between 65 and 68 are in some type of miasma of time which means, in reality, that they will not appear at all.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I want to inquire about a specific consequence of this. Other legislation has been dropped off entirely, including the Higher Education Authority Bill, about which it is stated that no date can be suggested for its publication. However, at the same time, the Government has commissioned the OECD to speed up the destruction of the university sector and other third level institutes that might be interested in broad education. A simple Directive No. 57, which would have given rights to workers, which is to transpose Directive No. 203/72, the European co-operative society Bill, will not come before us until 2006. Is this the type of behaviour of a reforming, re-invigorated, reincarnated Government? What about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own instructions? Perhaps he might work on the legislative programme and make a shorter list of what is likely to come before us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Michael Higgins for his advice but this is precisely what the Government has done. It has put forward a shorter list of what it hopes to do between now and Christmas. In the legislative process, which Deputy Higgins understands although perhaps not everybody does, the period from when a Bill is initiated or first examined until it is finally enacted in this House is sometimes very short, sometimes within a D&aacute;il session.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on who is blocking it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it depends on the urgency. Other Bills are debated at some length, others have different degrees of priority. I remember bringing many Bills before this House which took a long time to process. I brought in the Trade <Col N="651"/>Union Act in 1990, the development process of which began in 1958 and which I had the pleasure of completing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember it well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I brought in the amendments to the Truck Acts that were there since 1851 but which nobody had got around to changing until I did so in 1989. It is not a new or unusual feature of the House, therefore.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They must have been long-distance trucks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Higher Education Authority Bill referred to by Deputy Higgins, the date has been set because the Government set up an OECD group over the last year, involving participation by all the presidents and staffs of the universities, to review the higher education sector. The group has recently reported and it made sense to await that high-level report, which involved the entire third level sector, before introducing a Bill which would have been out of date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not involve the entire third level sector.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is now being reviewed on that basis. That is the logic with which I am sure Deputy Higgins will agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the extremely worrying derailment of the Luas so soon into its life on the streets of Dublin, I ask the Taoiseach, either by way of a statement or by bringing forward legislation on health and safety at work, to give the House some early opportunity to discuss this and to hear what independent assessment of the safety of the Luas is in place.</P>

	<P>It is not clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement to the House this morning regarding the appointment of Ministers of State <Col N="652"/>what specific functions are being assigned to them. Specifically with regard to housing policy is it intended that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will retain responsibility for it? Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, when he comes to make his delegation of functions order, have discretion in the reallocation of that responsibility?</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution sat through most of the summer recess in 2003, taking submissions from the general public with regard to property rights. Now that the committee&rsquo;s report has been submitted to the Government, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to implement it or must legislation be brought before the House to facilitate its implementation? It is important that the committee should now have a decision as to whether its submission has been accepted by the Government and if it will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach might ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Ms Harney, why I was left waiting 17 hours for an antibiotic in a hospital in the west.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue does not arise on the Order of Business. Deputy Breen can submit a question to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall check with the Department regarding the first issue raised by Deputy Breen. The Deputy is basing his question on a report that was presented. If he submits a question to the Minister, he will receive a reply on the action that is to be taken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the earlier references to the Bills under section C of the list of proposed legislation, when is the broadcasting authority Bill expected to be progressed or will it be conditional on No. 37, which is a continental shelf Bill? What priority rating will be given to the Bills? Perhaps the continental shelf Bill is indicative of where some of the other Bills might go.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the continental shelf Bill, which is to update and consolidate the Act of 1968, because of their strategic importance, the three main Continental Shelf Acts of 1968-1995 are being reviewed. The Acts do not provide for charging fees and rentals for pipelines and commercial activity generally. The heads of the Bill are expected towards the end of this year and legislation will hopefully be drafted in 2005.</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach at the start of this session whether any progress has been made by the Government in the matter of ground rents. This has been an issue for a long time and action has been promised for approximately eight years.</P>
    <P>I have one other question. Health boards have been abolished, they are not in existence and are not meeting. Yet, when decisions are made or actions taken, they are being described publicly as emanating from the health boards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter does not arise on the Order of Business. I suggest that Deputy Sherlock submit a question to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>In the matter of legislation, is it legally correct to call such decisions health board decisions or are they executive decisions?</P>

   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, the Loughs Agency, has been unable to function because there is no legislation in place. What is the delay in bringing forward that enabling legislation and when are we likely to see it before the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some difficulties with that implementation body. It has done some work. I am not sure if full legislation in this House is required but I will communicate with Deputy Morgan on the matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we have the Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? It is one of about 40 Bills which the new Minister for Foreign Affairs has left behind in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in various stages of disarray. Is the Taoiseach concerned that the pensioners of An Post have been waiting almost a year for their due increases under Sustaining Progress?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity given to us by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s Bill to discuss the important issues relating to enforcement of debts and fines. I would particularly like to address the issue of fines but, ironically, despite the stated intention of Fine Gael that the Bill should deal with fines, its provisions are so flawed that they do not do so and in effect the Bill is confined to civil debt.</P>
    <P>This basic flaw is not unrelated to the major flaw running through the Bill, that it is hastily conceived. In its blunt and unrefined form it has the capacity not just to fail to achieve what it sets out to achieve but in effect it could cause serious disruption of the workings of the courts and could serve to undermine the entire fines system.</P>
    <P>It was on this basis that in 1999 an almost identical Fine Gael Bill was rejected by the Government. It is unfortunate that none of the flaws identified by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, was taken note of and remedied before presenting the 2004 version of the Bill. Government is not just about presenting token, superficially attractive legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has to live in the real world and has to live up to his ministerial responsibility and introduce only those measures <Col N="655"/>which have a real chance of working and solving problems which emerge.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been keenly interested in the problems presented by the system for imposing and collecting fines. From information available in other jurisdictions it would appear that such problems are not limited to Ireland, but can be found in many jurisdictions. It seems that despite the various approaches to solving the problems, there is no evidence of the existence of a perfect model of success. This is simply because complex issues are involved and it is essential therefore that reform is tailored to meeting the problems which exist and to finding solutions which are fair, effective and efficient.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister is concerned that every effort should be made to improve the fines system and, in particular, that the system should operate so as to use prison only as a last resort. Accordingly, he has been conducting an ongoing review of the fines system. In that respect, he has had available to him a number of important reports relating to the subject of fines. In general terms, a summary of the recommendations on fines from these reports is that there should be improved means assessment by the courts to ensure fines imposed are within the means of the offenders to pay them; a facility to allow offenders to pay fines by instalment; and a means of enforcing fines other than by way of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agrees largely with these conclusions. He has already indicated that he intends to bring forward legislative proposals to reflect these recommendations. He is doing this in a phased way because he believes that it is necessary to assess and evaluate how different developments affect the overall system. As a first step he intends to bring a fines Bill to Government shortly. Although this Bill is primarily intended to update existing fines and provide a mechanism for indexation, he is also including in it proposals to strengthen the criteria to be used by the courts in assessing the means of the offenders before imposing fines. This provision is fundamental because most offenders who do not pay fines have financial difficulties. This was highlighted by the Nexus research co-operative report commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform entitled Imprisonment for Fine Default and Civil Debt and published in 2002. The report examined some of the key issues, such as why people ended up in prison in regard to non-payment of fines or debts. It was based on interviews and the personal circumstances, opinions and experiences of a sample of 24 imprisoned persons.</P>
    <P>The Nexus report found that persons imprisoned did not, for the most part, have the capacity to pay the fines imposed, which had to be paid in full. Most of the persons interviewed were not in permanent employment.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="656"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government wants to put them in jail and keep them there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>Only a very small number do not pay fines or debts on a point of principle. The idea of a payment process by instalments as an alternative to prison was broadly attractive. However, this may be of little real use in the light of the financial circumstances of those involved, which in turn highlights the need for a more effective means assessment before the fine is imposed. Similarly, in the absence of an employer for the majority of the persons surveyed, an attachment of earnings arrangement would not be a real solution. It was considered that an attachment of social welfare benefits would be problematic, particularly for people living in or close to the poverty line.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Put them in jail instead. That is the Government solution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is putting forward a fines Bill which will address the issue of the assessment of the individual&rsquo;s financial capability to pay a fine. That step is being brought forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, said. We are still waiting and people are still going to jail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is vitally important in the interest of fairness to these people and in the interest of efficiency in the system that fines are set at an affordable level. However, the Fine Gael Bill, focused as it is on procedures, omits the inclusion of such a provision to ensure basic fairness to the less well-off in our society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s fairness for the less well-off is to put them in jail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, on the other hand, has said that he will provide for such assessment in the forthcoming fines Bill. Importantly, that Bill will also include provisions for the payment of fines by instalment. In that regard, it is the intention that such a payment arrangement will only be available to those who genuinely need it having regard to their financial circumstances and the amount of the fine imposed. Bearing in mind that there are over 110,000 fines imposed in the District Court annually, if every such fine could attract an instalment order, serious administrative problems could arise for the Courts Service, as Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is well aware. I agree that those who can afford to pay the fine in one amount should have to do so. However, I do not consider, as the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill proposes, that such a facility, which will use valuable court resources, should be available to the more affluent.</P>
    <P>The second stage of the Minister&rsquo;s legislative approach will involve the proposed enforcement of fines Bill which is also on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. The stated aim of this Bill <Col N="657"/>is to end imprisonment as far as practicable for non-payment of fines and to provide for new ways to enforce fines. The Minister is actively considering a range of alternative measures, but he will only introduce such measures when he is satisfied that they will improve the efficiency and fairness of the system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In the meantime they should continue to be put in jail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must be satisfied regarding the practicality of proposals he introduces. For example, a significant range of alternative enforcement options is available to the courts in the UK yet they are little used. The most workable solutions in that jurisdiction are the facility to pay fines by instalment and extended time to pay. Such findings have served to strengthen the Minister&rsquo;s view that the primary focus should be on doing all that can be done to help people to pay rather than placing an unduly strong emphasis on enforcement, particularly as such measures may have harsh consequences.</P>
    <P>The alternative enforcement measures proposed in the legislation will not necessarily create a fairer or more enabling system for the offender.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It will keep them out of jail, which is where the Deputy wishes to put them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal relates to procedures. The introduction of attachment of earnings and attachment of social welfare contributions without first making available a fairer procedure for imposition of the fine and its collection raises serious questions. While the Minister acknowledges there are workable alternatives to imprisonment, his primary focus is on introducing measures that will help the person to pay the fine.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s intention is then to build on the measures proposed in the fines Bill. This will provide for a more accurate assessment of what other measures are required and will permit him to take into account the impact of the proposals contained in that Bill. It will also provide for consideration to be given to the effect of other developments, for example, the impact of the increasing number of road traffic offences where a fixed payment and or penalty points is involved. This emphasises the importance of ensuring improvement measures take account of all dimensions of the operation of the fines system.</P>
    <P>I refer to the enforcement provisions. Section 14 provides for attachment orders on amounts payable as income support. The Minister is not completely ruling out this option but it must be approached with the greatest caution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be that attachment of earnings has a role in regard to the wealthy offender or the offender who decides it would be cheaper to spend a few days in jail than pay a <Col N="658"/>heavy fine. However, it cannot be used as a blunt instrument. For instance, the Department&rsquo;s own research project concluded that fine defaulters tend to be unemployed or not in the labour force. An attachment of earnings mechanism would be useless in these circumstances while attaching welfare payments raises serious questions about whether such attachment provisions could push vulnerable people over the poverty line. Given that my constituency, Dublin South Central, is the economically and socially most deprived in the State, I will not support this provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s alternative is to maintain the current policy and continue to put people in jail. What does the Deputy want?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>The problems associated with the Bill could cause not only administrative headaches but also result in unfairness to the less fortunate among us. It is for this reason the Government must reject the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is incredible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Minister will provide practical solutions regarding fines in the forthcoming fines Bill and enforcement of fines Bill. He will take note of the contributions by Members and the good suggestions in Deputy O&rsquo; Keeffe&rsquo;s Bill in doing so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ardagh for sharing time. I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, on introducing the Bill. It is important to focus on an issue, which may have been neglected for some time. While I do not fully support the legislation, what he is trying to achieve is a worthy cause. It takes great courage for an Opposition Member to go to the trouble of submitting a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>
    <P>The debate gives us an opportunity to discuss important issues relating to the non-payment of fines or debts. I refer, in particular, to civil debt. Despite the best intentions of Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, due to a flaw in drafting, the Bill is confined to civil debt. It does not effectively deal with the issue of fines and what new approaches might be taken in this regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has maintained that it is not the primary function of his Department or the Courts Service to take on the role of operating a debt management service for people who find themselves, for whatever reason, in arrears to banks and finance houses.</P>
    <P>All Members will agree more effort and resources should be concentrated on the work of the money advice and budgeting service. This body has a critical role to play in helping people to address the problems of over-indebtedness, which usually result from bad management, panic attacks and so on. The MABS approach, based on the willingness of the debtor to manage his or her case and to seek expert advice, is the best way forward. This offers much better prospects of a <Col N="659"/>successful resolution of the credit problem. The service maintains a special relationship with the credit unions, which is important. However, MABS gives practical finance and budgeting advice and practical assistance in helping to engage with creditors but it does not pay debts.</P>
    <P>The key features of MABS are the resources, contacts and expertise of all relevant people in an area who co-operate to provide a special service for people who require help and advice in working their way out of serious debt. The Government makes a significant financial commitment to MABS &mdash; &euro;11.4 million in 2004. This allows it to help more than 12,000 new clients annually. This number highlights the serious difficulties faced. I encourage the new Minister for Social and Family Affairs to continue to provide generously for this service.</P>
    <P>This voluntary approach, through MABS, offers a better way of achieving a result acceptable to both creditor and debtor. Financial institutions prefer such voluntary alternative approaches, most likely because they have a better chance of recovering their money. However, it is often difficult to persuade persons in debt to engage in any process &mdash; they bury their heads in the sand &mdash; whether it involves voluntary mediation or court proceedings, until it is too late. We have all encountered such people at our clinics seeking advice.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the Courts Service, which has its own different and important functions to carry out, should adopt a new role in managing a debt collection and recovery process for thousands of people imposed on it, as proposed in the legislation. If a judgment is made in a civil debt, the person can go before the District Court, file a statement of means and the judge can decide what repayment can be afforded. It is only when that person refuses to pay, thereby disobeying the court order, that an order to be committed can be sought and granted. That threat is usually enough to make most people pay. Most District Court and Circuit Court judges do not normally commit people where it is blatantly obvious someone cannot afford to pay a fine or debt. If that sanction is abolished, people may not pay at all.</P>
    <P>A number of the technical flaws in this Bill were mentioned last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor. By redistributing the problem in the way set out by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, we run the risk of making the burden even more acute regarding how such offenders are addressed. This highlights that we must be extremely careful about how we approach changes to court procedures.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that a system of payment by instalments should be introduced. However, this must be achieved in a planned way using well defined procedures. For instance, it is essential that there should be a minimum threshold for a fine below which payment by instalment cannot <Col N="660"/>be used. There should also be a maximum number of instalments and a set time to complete the exercise. Should a person default on a payment within the process, a separate default procedure should be provided. These are only a few of the issues that require full consideration in bringing forward workable legislation.</P>
    <P>Similar procedural issues arise involving the attachment of earnings provisions contained in the Bill. While it is proposed that creditors are to seek such orders, it is not clear in all cases who exactly the creditor will be. For example, in the case of the large number of fines payable to the Exchequer, who would appear before the court to request the order?</P>
    <P>There are other concerns which come to mind. Section 4(2) seeks to provide that an attachment of earnings order should be directed at an employer, in which case it is possible that the employment of some people would be jeopardised by the Bill. Compliance with an attachment of earnings order would involve a significant level of bureaucracy for employers to deal with what in many cases would be minimal amounts. Many employers would have cause to think twice before employing people from particular backgrounds. As an employer would be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months if he or she failed to comply with the Bill, an attachment of earnings order might be good reason for many employers to consider the continuation of a person&rsquo;s employment, especially where that person&rsquo;s position was temporary. According to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, an employer would be given ten days to comply with an attachment of earnings order. Even the Revenue Commissioners provide more time, typically allowing a minimum of 20 days and in some cases in excess of a month.</P>
    <P>The problems associated with the Bill could cause not just administrative headaches but also real unfairness to the less fortunate. By contrast, the Minister for Justice. Equality and Law Reform will provide practical solutions in the forthcoming fines Bill through provisions to strengthen means assessment and payment of fines by instalment. He will also bring forward further sensible proposals on the enforcement of fines in the enforcement of fines Bill. I have no doubt that in doing so he will note the contributions of Members and in particular some of the solid provisions outlined in Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s Bill. While the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill may not be entirely to our liking, certain aspects of it deserve the Minister&rsquo;s close attention.</P>
    <P>The use of prison is, of course, undesirable and incarceration has significant social consequences. However, while it provides an effective deterrent, prison should not be used as an automatic sanction for every crime. Much as the Opposition wishes to claim otherwise, the figures for the use of prison to sanction non-payment of fines and debts are exaggerated. Last night, we heard that there were only 37 persons so imprisoned. No person should have to go to prison for the non-payment of a fine if it can be established to the <Col N="661"/>satisfaction of the court that he or she genuinely cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the real proposals outlined in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce two new Bills to deal with fines issues. I acknowledge the enormous efforts made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his predecessor on the prison building and modernisation programme. Under the rainbow coalition, we had a disastrous policy of revolving-door prisons for criminals, but those doors are revolving no longer.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s Bill contains many salient provisions, I oppose it for a number of reasons. However, I urge the Minister to take into account some of the very solid proposals Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe has expounded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>While I commend Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe on introducing this Bill, as the Minister of State stated yesterday evening, the Government cannot support it. The Bill is very similar to the Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposed in 1998 by then Deputy Jim Higgins and rejected by the Government on the basis that its proposals could undermine the existing system for the payment of fines, result in significant administrative costs and create an excessive administrative burden while having little or no effect on the prison population. While similar problems and issues arise in the Bill before us today, this debate has been extremely useful in giving all of us an opportunity to consider and discuss the issues raised. I am sure regard will be given to the valuable and important points made during this debate when future measures in this area are being formulated.</P>
    <P>Since the 1999 debate on this issue much important work has been carried out on fines. The Government cannot be accused of inaction. Yesterday, the Minister of State outlined to the House the various reports which have recommended the introduction of improved means assessment by the courts to ensure fines imposed are within the means of offenders to pay, the introduction of a facility to allow offenders to pay fines by instalment and the implementation of enforcement methods other than imprisonment. Clearly, proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce enhanced means assessment and payment by instalment in the fines Bill represent the first stage in addressing these issues.</P>
    <P>The 2000 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the report of the high level interdepartmental group have also been key in forming a basis for consideration and action. The high level group, which was formed on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, submitted a detailed report and recommendations to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2001. The report was considered briefly by the committee in November 2002.</P>
    <P>There are two key points which I consider it worthwhile to restate. First, the overall objective <Col N="662"/>of the fines system is to reduce the level of offences committed. Second, it is clear that to achieve good enforcement, we must first ensure that we have a system in place which provides for appropriate fines to be imposed, structured support for paying fines and improved enforcement mechanisms. The Minister of State has outlined in detail developments which I do not intend to restate now in the areas of clamping, penalty points, the fixed charge processing system, measures taken by the Courts Service to reduce delays in dealing with cases and issuing warrants and the introduction of information technology systems in the courts and other agencies to improve current systems.</P>
    <P>Further initiatives are being introduced such as the measures in the proposed fines Bill which will include proposals to strengthen the criteria to be used by the courts in assessing the means of offenders before imposing fines. The Bill will also include provisions for the payment of fines by instalment for those who genuinely need such a facility in the context of their financial circumstances. In terms of strengthening means assessment, this is an extremely important provision. It is vital from the perspectives of fairness and efficiency that fines, while of course reflecting the seriousness of the offence, are also set at an affordable level.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic. Many offenders who do not pay fines are experiencing financial difficulties. This realisation constitutes a fundamental omission from the Fine Gael Bill which fails to provide for provisions to strengthen means assessment. This observation is borne out by the fact that the Nexus research co-operative report commissioned by the Department concluded that offenders for fine default tend to be unemployed or not in the labour force. The provision of other measures such as attachment of earnings and even arrangements to pay by instalment are of little use if a fine has not been set at a level that the person in question can afford. While the Fine Gael Bill makes provision for payment by instalment, it does so impractically by proposing that such a facility should be available to all offenders regardless of their circumstances. As the introduction of instalment arrangements will increase the administrative work of the courts, it would be a waste of resources to allow those who can easily afford to pay a fine in the normal way to avail of such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out that it is intended to adopt an incremental approach to this issue. It is interesting to note that while in the United Kingdom there is a wide range of alternative enforcement options available to the courts, they are not extensively used. The options which work best are the facility to pay by instalment and the provision of extended time in which to pay. Clearly, this is a lesson from which we can learn. The United Kingdom example reinforces the approach being taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Throwing a range of solutions at an issue without first <Col N="663"/>assessing the impact of individual measures is not always effective. Where this happens, it is certainly not efficient. The introduction of the specific measures proposed in the fines Bill will allow the Minister, in developing proposals for the enforcement of fines Bill, to take into account the impact developments such as relating the amount of a fine to a person&rsquo;s means, the facility for payment by instalment and the increasing number of road traffic offences where a fixed payment and-or penalty point is provided, have had on the effectiveness of the fines system. It is important that the emphasis be on helping people to pay the fine rather than on enforcement procedures.</P>
    <P>The issue of attachment of earnings as proposed in the Fine Gael Bill requires careful consideration. The proposal is particularly lacking in that it does not take into account factors such as to whom and in what circumstances attachment should apply. While it may prove to be a suitable mechanism for better off offenders or for those who choose not to pay a fine it may be of little or no benefit to those on low incomes. Attachment of social welfare payments raises serious questions for those sections of our community who may already be living near the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Various issues have been raised in this debate regarding committal to prison for non-payment of fines and debts, including whether it is appropriate that persons who do not pay their fines or debts are committed to prison and the effect on spaces available within the prisons. It is important we are realistic in considering this issue. As pointed out yesterday by the Minister of State, the number of people in custody for non-payment of fines or debts tends to be in the region of 1.2% of the prison population because sentences for such offences are generally short. In addition, some defaulters make payment either on committal or shortly afterwards. Even if the Bill had the<?oasys_jy?><?oasys _dc20-?>effect that no fine or debt defaulter took up prison places in future, which is unlikely, the result in terms of prison places would be so minor as to be of no significance. Also, as many defaulters are held in open prisons there is no guarantee there would be suitable prisoners in closed institutions who could be transferred to take up these places should they become available.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>Although fine and debt defaulters represent only a tiny fraction of the prison population at any given time, the numbers committed places a heavy administrative burden on prisons. To place that burden on the Courts Service and the Garda, as the Bill appears to do, would not be the solution. While imprisonment should be a sanction of last resort and while it is clear that issues such as those raised in the Bill need to be addressed, to put this measure forward as having substantial positive implications in terms of prison accommodation is unsustainable.</P>
    <P>The Government, like many Deputies, is concerned about this type of imprisonment and its undesirability. I am sure Members will agree that many of the measures taken and proposed by <Col N="664"/>Government will be of benefit in this regard. Of particular relevance will be the proposals to ensure that fines imposed, while taking into account the seriousness of the offence, will be set at a level that reflects the financial circumstances of the person and that payment of fines by instalment will be available for those who require it.</P>
    <P>A mechanism for payment of debts by instalment already exists and the court goes through extensive procedures before making an instalment order and, if necessary, a committal order. On the use of community service orders and supervision of offenders, it is clear that valuable resources such as the probation and welfare service should be carefully targeted where they are most effective and should deal with more serious offenders.</P>
    <P>The problems brought about by debt are ones of which I am sure many Deputies are keenly aware in dealing with their constituents. Our society has developed in such a way that credit is widely available but, unfortunately, some in our communities experience difficulties by over extending their borrowing arrangements and mismanaging their financial situations.</P>

	<P>I can claim a little expertise on this issue as I was jailed in Mountjoy Prison for failure to pay a fine. However, in my case I had refused to pay a fine as a protest in solidarity with women street traders who were being driven off the streets of Dublin and prevented from earning a living selling apples and flowers as generations of their families had done. Big business, the Garda and the courts had combined to break the will of these impoverished women and when all else had failed large fines of £400 and £500 were imposed on them, fines that accumulated leaving them unable to pay. They were then taken to Mountjoy Prison to serve terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>When in Mountjoy Prison I was amazed at the number of prisoners there for non-payment of fines. It seemed to everyone that this was incredibly unjust. While the revolving door was in full swing at the time the only prisoners who seemed not to benefit from it were those judged to be in contempt of court because of their inability to pay fines. I am well aware that the system has changed but the principle remains the same. That is why I have some sympathy for the spirit of the Fine Gael Bill before us. However, I wish to respond to the assertion in last night&rsquo;s debate by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, that the policies of this Government have succeeded in reducing crime. I reject that claim which is out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday evening last, I attended a meeting of approximately 200 residents of the Clonliffe <Col N="665"/>Road-Tolka Road area of my constituency. There had been a surge in house burglaries during the previous three weeks. The garda&iacute; in attendance stated they had a list of nine reported break-ins in the area in the past month. The residents claimed the number of break-ins was more than twice that number but that many people failed to report the incident to the Garda because they felt it was a waste of time. One woman said one would be considered lucky if the Garda called back to take fingerprints but would not hear a word more on the matter. The residents wanted action. At a minimum they wanted regular Garda foot patrols as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Crime has been on the increase in other parts of my constituency in recent weeks. Residents along the Royal Canal in Phibsboro are under siege in their homes at night with gangs of youths roaming the canal bank, hurling rocks at windows and attempting to rob and vandalise cars. Again, the residents want regular Garda patrols. Not far away a gang drinking on the pedestrian footpath of the Royal Canal bank savagely attacked a Lithuanian man and left him near dead. In parts of Cabra, gangs of youths of 12 to 15 years of age are causing problems for residents who say the Garda are slow to respond. Many people have lost faith in reporting these activities to the Garda. Painting a rosy picture of crime statistics, as the Minister of State did last night, only serves to infuriate people all the more. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to recognise the reality of increasing lawlessness on our streets and to take action to deal with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill. I have held the view since entering public life 19 years ago that imprisonment for non-payment of fines is not right and should be imposed only as a last resort. I believe hardened criminals should serve their term in prison without remission.</P>
    <P>The imprisonment of approximately 60 people a day for the non-payment of fines is a drain on Garda resources. We must also take into account the cost to the State of pursuing the matter in court, dispatching garda&iacute; to take the person to prison and of keeping that person in prison. We must put in place facilities that allow people to pay fines by way of instalment. I know of families who have been awaiting court appearances for many years. Often people experiencing severe hardship get involved in petty or serious crime in an effort to make ends meet. People in such circumstances should not be imprisoned for non-payment of fines. A person who cannot pay for a television licence through poverty, illness or a broken home should not be sent to prison. Overcrowding in the prison system must be tackled and the Judiciary should be mindful of this when handing down sentences. Often it appears to the public that the punishment does not suit the crime.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a number of garda&iacute; are due to retire this year and the superintendent in the area is concerned that these garda&iacute; will not be <Col N="666"/>replaced. Where are the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the last general election? There is no sign of them. The Minister, however, has done a good job. When Michael Flatley retires, the Taoiseach can take his place because he dances to every tune called by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard that this Bill is similar to the 1998 Bill. That may be the case but there has been very little movement in this area since then and the assessment of earnings, attachment orders, payment by instalments and the use of community service instead of imprisonment are excellent ideas that should be pursued.</P>
    <P>The Government has suggested that crime levels have fallen significantly in recent times. There may have been a reduction in the reporting of crime but that is because many people now believe that there is little or no point in reporting a crime to the garda&iacute; when nothing will be done about it. Regularly I am told by people that they have contacted the garda&iacute; about crime and anti-social behaviour to find that they either do not respond or arrive so late that it is not worth coming. That is not a criticism of the garda&iacute; but of the number of garda&iacute; available. In Clonmel, only eight garda&iacute; are available at any one time, including those on duty in the station. There is no way such a small number of garda&iacute; can deal with anti-social behaviour, a problem that exists throughout the country and that has been caused by a Government that has created a two tier society. I call on the Minister to ensure additional Garda resources are put in place, particularly garda&iacute; on the beat, liaison officers and community garda&iacute;, to ensure the scourge of anti-social behaviour is controlled.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party welcomes the Bill and feels it is a step in the right direction. It is madness that in the 21st century, citizens of this State are incarcerated for non-payment of fines. If we look back 200 years, there were debtors&rsquo; prisons in every large town but those prisons belong to a bygone age. It does not make sense to incarcerate someone for the non-payment of a fine, to tell someone he is being put in jail for not paying a sum of money. It demeans the whole idea of prison and prison sentencing. It is madness that someone who does not pay his television licence can end up in Mountjoy. Society must come up with better ways to deal with the non-payment of fines.</P>
    <P>We agree wholeheartedly with the broad thrust of this Bill. Much of it would have to be worked out on Committee Stage but the Government will not give it the chance to reach that Stage. It is worth reflecting, however, with the numbers in the prison system at an all-time high, that the Taoiseach said yesterday he would be tough on crime but neglected to use the Tony Blair line that he would also be tough on the causes of crime.</P><Col N="667"/>
    <P>After an unprecedented period of change, the divisions in Irish society are wider than ever before and the State must address those divisions and ensure people do not end up in prison for the non-payment of fines. It must ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s dalliance, its fling with Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy, is more than that. It should be the start of a long-term relationship rather than an overnight affair in Inchydoney. I call on the Minister of State to make a commitment on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il to social justice rather than flirt with it for a few hours in west Cork. It is not good enough to say that Fianna F&aacute;il will be tough on crime if it is not determined to address the underlying causes of crime and address why people are being imprisoned for the non-payment of a fine.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 5 of the Bill that the Minister can make a request in exceptional circumstances for the sentence to be served if there are less than six months remaining. Those circumstances must be clarified. It is all very well to mention them but the Bill should detail the circumstances under which the Minister can say that a sentence must be served. Similarly, under section 7, the person arrested must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible. The ambiguity there should be clarified, with a definition of the timeframe involved.</P>
    <P>In section 8, a person arrested under a warrant must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible and the High Court must remand the person in custody pending the production of the Minister&rsquo;s certificate. The Bill states that if a certificate is not produced within 18 days, the person must be released. That seems too long a period in the 21st century, with the availability of fax machines and e-mail, and it should be changed.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There was confusion about section 4 of the Bill. We are specifically concerned that it allows the court to grant an attachment of earnings order directing the debtor&rsquo;s employer to periodically deduct specified amounts from the employee&rsquo;s wages at source. We are concerned at the implications of this section for civil liberties. It sets up a relationship between a third party and the State that is not correct and it has massive implications for employer-employee relations. It allows the employer to know the private business of the individual and he or she could then use the information to manipulate the employee. The MABS bureau model would be suitable in this regard because it allows the individual being fined to make provision for that, and perhaps Fine Gael will look at this.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill and commend Fine Gael on bringing it to the House, although we are concerned about section 4.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill as a constructive contribution to justice legislation. A similar Bill was promised by the Government but has been long-fingered by our Minister for injustice and inequality who is more concerned with <Col N="668"/>chasing down immigrants and their children, having yesterday published his fourth Bill concerning immigration law in two years.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal in the explanatory memorandum to end the practice of people being sent to jail for failing to pay fines. Whatever this states about a lack of consistency and coherence in policy orientation between the former Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, Deputy Deasy, and his successor, the new approach taken by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is refreshingly progressive and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>We know that imprisonment of fine defaulters is neither economically nor socially cost effective. We also know that sending debtors to prison costs us roughly half the amount owed and that, even after jail time has been served, the debts remain largely unpaid. Therefore, the practice makes no economic sense. Moreover, the persistence of this policy and practice is a litmus test of the unjust orientation of our so-called justice system which continues to discriminate against offenders, particularly those who are poor.</P>
    <P>Two gratuitous cases in point have been reported in the media since this Minister took office in 2002. In one case, Mr. David Gartland, an illiterate unemployed man, was jailed for ten days having failed to pay a &euro;12 dog licence because he could not read the regulations. The second case involved Ms Marie Connolly, a full-time carer for seven children and a disabled partner who was supporting her family on unemployment benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance. Seven years ago, she failed to pay a television licence and defaulted on a payment of &euro;160 which would have amounted to almost half the family&rsquo;s weekly income. She was prevented from paying the fine in instalments and served five days in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>These are the &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; criminals in respect of whom the Taoiseach yesterday endorsed the Minister&rsquo;s plans to create more prison beds instead of the hospital beds which are needed. If we cleared the prisons of these non-dangerous offenders, we would have plenty of room for those who pose a risk to society.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill because it is unacceptable that people who truly cannot afford to pay a debt or fine without hardship have to serve time in prison rather than the wealthy individuals and corporate tax evaders, corrupt developers, officials and politicians who deliberately and with malice cheated the people out of millions of euro.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions about this Bill and some provisions need to be amended. For example, I am not convinced that those in receipt of social welfare payments or on very low wages should have their payments garnished by the court. I would like to see community restorative justice principles applied to the provisions in sections 4 and 14 to introduce a greater use of community service orders in place of wage or welfare payment garnishing where a garnish would cause undue financial hardship taking into <Col N="669"/>account the specifics of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that section 4 should give the court greater guidance on how to determine what level of income the individual needs to maintain himself or herself and his or her family as the current formulation of a protected earnings rate is vague and possibly overtly discretionary. The many criticisms to which I and others have referred, in particular Deputy Ardagh&rsquo;s, could be dealt with by Committee Stage amendments rather than waiting for the moveable feast which is the raft of Bills referred to in the legislative programme.</P>
    <P>I was elected in 2002 and the fines and enforcement of fines Bills were promised for 2003. However, in the latest incarnation of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for autumn 2004, the fines Bill is earmarked for 2005 and it is not possible to indicate when the enforcement of fines Bill will be taken. We have an opportunity now to progress this procedure in order to deal with this issue. We should take the opportunity to give the Bill a Second Reading and deal with the concerns raised on Committee Stage to deliver, I hope, worthwhile legislation.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and compliment Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe on publishing it and moving Second Stage. The principle behind it is to provide an alternative to jail for people who cannot afford to pay a fine or debt. The two key elements are to apply attachment of earnings orders so that employers are obliged to deduct part of employees&rsquo; salaries to pay outstanding fines and the application of attachment of welfare orders on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at Deputy Ardagh&rsquo;s claim that the Bill would victimise people in receipt of social welfare benefits since the Government already has in place such arrangements for the overpayment of social welfare benefits. Moreover, it has consistently been a reasonable procedure of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and most people would agree it has been very fair and balanced. However, when a similar suggestion is proposed by Fine Gael, Deputy Ardagh states that it will victimise social welfare recipients when the exact opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Under current Government proposals, social welfare recipients are victimised in respect of the non-payment of fines because most of them end up in jail. This is the Government&rsquo;s solution to the problem. Up to 1,000 people a year, the majority receiving social welfare, end up in jail for the non-payment of fines. Therefore, it is disingenuous of Deputy Ardagh to make such a point.</P><Col N="670"/>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will radically change the manner in which the courts enforce and collect fines and represent a positive development. Approximately 50% of all fines issued cannot be collected. Statistics in Dublin show that 45% of the fines imposed are never collected. Based on the 1998 figures, &euro;6.3 million of fines were uncollected which, when added to the &euro;3.7 million per annum it costs to jail people for non-payment, amounts to an additional &euro;10 million which could be invested elsewhere. For example, it could be invested in badly needed increased Garda resources, in funding for people with disabilities or diversion programmes for young offenders. The money would be better spent focusing on those areas rather than in loss of income to the State and it having to pay &euro;225 per day to keep a prisoner in jail for the non-payment of a fine which, in some cases as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh pointed out, may be as little as &euro;12. It seems a relatively paltry figure compared with the huge cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment of debt or fines by instalment which is a great step forward because it is not possible at present. It causes huge problems for many low income families when a fine is imposed. The fine may be small but there is no mechanism to pay it in instalments. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is prepared to take repayments by instalments. It works well within one Department so I cannot see why the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot piggyback on it. It is a balanced proposal which would have positive implications.</P>
    <P>It is irresponsible of the Government to oppose the Bill since it has no imminent plans to address the problem. The previous Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue was tabled in this House six years ago and the Government has done nothing since to address the problem. All the speakers on the Government benches have referred to technical flaws in the Bill. We accept such flaws exist but Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe has made it clear that he is prepared to amend the Bill on Committee Stage. The issue is whether the Government is prepared to accept the principle of the Bill. It would be a positive development if the Government accepted the principle and allowed the Bill to progress to Committee Stage since the very purpose of Committee Stage is to address the technical flaws and other problems which have been highlighted.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to examples of crazy situations in regard to imprisonment for fines. An example from an area in which I have a personal interest is the collection of road traffic fines.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that Ennis Town Council can pursue a northern or UK driver across the Border and collect a fine for non-payment of a parking ticket in Ennis, yet the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot pursue someone who exceeds the speed limit in this jurisdiction. This crazy situation in which a town <Col N="671"/>council can pursue fines while the Department cannot has resulted in Northern Ireland drivers getting away scot-free with road traffic offences south of the Border. In some instances, these drivers have been involved in fatal road accidents. Is it surprising that the Border counties have the highest incidence of road traffic accidents and fatalities? Nothing seems to have been done about the slaughter we witnessed on the roads of County Donegal this summer. It is extremely frustrating that a town council can pursue a northern or UK registered driver for a parking fine while the Department cannot pursue them for a speeding fine. The problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party proposals present an alternative to prison. Prison should be for convicted, dangerous criminals who need to be behind bars, not those who have not paid a dog or television licence. Prison places should be freed up, additional places created and resources provided for programmes for prisoners. As the Minister has informed the House <i>ad nauseam</i>, space in our prisons is at a premium. We can no longer tolerate the crazy revolving door system by which people convicted of serious crimes are released to allow people who have not paid a dog licence be put in prison.</P>
    <P>Included in the Bill are proposals such as shortening the time window within which vehicle changes may take place, which is tied in with recommendations made in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published on Tuesday. It highlighted the problem associated with pursuing people for penalty points. Garages must be held responsible for ensuring that the proper registered owner of a car is registered in the vehicle registration unit in Shannon.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case of a middle aged woman who has been hounded by penalty point notifications issued to her in her name, despite the vehicle in question having changed ownership six months ago. Her garage is supposed to sort out the problem but nothing has happened. This area needs to be tightened by making garages responsible for ensuring cars are properly registered.</P>
    <P>If fines were registered against a vehicle, it would also ensure that the fine could be collected when motor tax on a vehicle is renewed or its ownership changes and fines would no longer accumulate as is currently the case. I hope this will be addressed.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that Garda resources are limited. The Minister&rsquo;s commitment in the run-up to the general election to recruit an additional 2,000 garda&iacute; was a fig leaf and has yet to be met. We need to remove garda&iacute; from behind desks and put them on the street. Transferring the collection of fines to civilians would be easy and would not cause legal complications. I urge the Department to act on this issue. Garda&iacute; are needed to ensure our streets are safe. They should not be positioned on every yellow box along both Luas routes. I am sure the Department is not being <Col N="672"/>reimbursed by the RPA or Connex for the costs it is incurring. Garda resources could be better allocated and something must be done.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the computerised penalty points system is crazy. The system, which was supposed to be in place on 1 January 2002, will not operate until at least the middle of 2005. The reason is that the pilot scheme, while finally up and running in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has still not been integrated with the PULSE system. We appointed contractors to do a job, for which the Department specified criteria, yet it is still not tied in with the PULSE system and will not be in place until mid-2005. This illustrates the bureaucracy in the Department and its lack of a proactive approach.</P>
    <P>Garda&iacute; across the country are shuffling paper rather than policing the Road Traffic Acts and ensuring our streets our safe. Instead of having to go out with a bench warrant to take people to court or jail for the non-payment of fines, a matter addressed in the legislation, garda&iacute; should tackle the serious crime and assaults taking place on the streets. Even the smallest towns and villages have serious problems with anti-social behaviour and it appears nothing is being done. Instead, garda&iacute; are choked with more paperwork and less resources for day-to-day policing. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment my party&rsquo;s spokesman on justice, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe. His Bill should be accepted by the Government. One aspect of politics that annoys me is to see Deputies on the Government side congratulate Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe on producing a great Bill before reading from a script provided by the Department setting out 100 reasons for not voting in favour of it. Government Deputies have made every excuse for opposing a reasonable Bill. If there is a problem with the legislation, the Government could propose amendments on Committee Stage. I wish the Minister of State was the senior Minister as he would be more reasonable.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking awards were paid to civil servants last year to upgrade procedures. I will outline to the officials present an experience I had last week. One of my constituents, who is separated from her husband, had reason to be in court. She receives a payment from her husband every week but must wait for him to pay the money to the court clerk, who then sends it to her. When I wrote to the court clerk on the matter, he informed me that no procedure is in place to allow payment by direct debit or for the money to be debited from the husband&rsquo;s account.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking was paid in order that services could be provided and to ensure civil servants were retrained and acquired new skills. It would be simple for a Government office to establish a procedure to facilitate direct debits from a client&rsquo;s account. The courts, in making awards, have asked that this be done. We are going back 50 years rather than going forward 50 years if a court must first receive a cheque, lodge it in a bank and <Col N="673"/>then send it out. Why are there no direct debit arrangements? I ask the officials present to note this problem and discuss ways to rectify it. This is 2004, not 1916 and it is reasonable to expect a solution to this matter.</P>
    <P>As a politician, I deal with people every day. If a person who has been unable to pay a fine is prosecuted for non-payment and fined a further &euro;600 or &euro;700, how can we expect him or her to have the money to pay the fine there and then? It has upset me over the years to see members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na calling at houses to tell people they must immediately pay fines of &euro;600 or &euro;700. If they did not have the money on the first occasion, they will not have it the second time.</P>
    <P>The problem always affects women. In most cases, men receive the fines but do not worry about them, leaving the matter instead to be dealt with by their wives and families. Garda&iacute; seeking payment of a fine refuse to allow people to pay in instalments. This approach is wrong and must change.</P>
    <P>The Bill Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe has brought before the House is very reasonable. There is only one place for serious criminals in this country, namely, in jail. I refer to murderers, rapists and those committing serious crimes on a regular basis. The Minister and Minister of State should note that the garda&iacute; always go for the soft target, such as a person who cannot pay a fine for having no television licence or dog licence or for drunken driving. Of course the garda&iacute; can call to the houses of such people, arrest them and put them in jail. However, where are the serious criminals in this and other cities? They are not working, they have big houses, they are driving around in Mercedes cars and do not demonstrate that they have means, yet they are not in prison. These are the people we should be targeting. They are causing problems for decent, honest people who are trying to make a living, and they are selling drugs to our young children.</P>
    <P>As I was coming to Leinster House via the quays some nights ago I saw five garda&iacute; with a camera trying to catch those exceeding the 30 mph speed limit. One would be very lucky to have a free run up or down the quays at any time in this city, yet the garda&iacute; had pulled in one or two drivers for exceeding the speed limit. I do not like that and I spoke about it in the past. The garda&iacute; should be targeting the guys who are driving at 70, 80 and 90 mph and killing people at 3 o&rsquo;clock and 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The poor devil the garda&iacute; had pulled in on the quays some nights ago was probably going to work and might have been doing 40 mph in a 30 mph zone. If he tried to drive on the quays today, tomorrow or the next day, he would not get down them for an hour. It often takes me two hours to drive three or four miles down the road if there is bad traffic in the city.</P>
    <P>I support the Garda and law and order, but I do not support the trend to go for the easy target all the time. I want to see the serious criminals <Col N="674"/>behind bars. I want to see the criminals who are making our lives and those of our families a misery being targeted, particularly those who are smuggling drugs into the country. We have seen that the Garda can deal with some of these serious criminals when given the resources, but there are many more of them who have not been caught. We should be targeting the guys driving around in expensive cars who have big homes, do not work or draw social welfare and have no way of showing what means they have. These are the people who should be behind bars, not those who owe &euro;600 or &euro;700 or those who do not pay their television licence fees or cannot afford to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten is correct. I am spokesperson on social welfare and I note every day the areas where there is a problem. In some cases, it is the Department that makes the mistake but the people to whom I refer do not have the resources to bring it to court. In some cases they notify the Department about a problem, yet the Department, when it discovers that it has made a mistake six months or a year later, adds an attachment to their social welfare.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for social welfare take only what people can afford and this should be the case in regard to fines. If one has been fined &euro;600 or &euro;700, an attachment order should be served on one&rsquo;s earnings or social welfare at a reasonable rate that will not have a major effect on one&rsquo;s family, rather than putting one in jail. In this regard, consider the case of a woman who came into my clinic some years ago who said her husband got caught for drunken driving and received a big fine. She added that he would keep drinking and she would have to keep paying. She claimed the garda came to her door with a certificate stating the extent of the fine. She was not able to pay it on the day and she is not able to pay it now.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable Bill that might lead to progress in this area. The Minister of State and the Government should accept it and not simply read the scripts of the departmental scriptwriters. Let us deal with whatever faults or weaknesses are in this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that I cannot accept the invitation just offered to me by Deputy Ring. Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe proposed this Bill and I am sure that from the time he started as a practitioner before the courts, the following words have echoed through his mind: &ldquo;Fine £100 one week in default&rdquo;. A fundamental problem with legislation in this area is that there has to be an ultimate option regarding the collection of fines. I accept that an attempt has been made in this Bill by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe to try to examine how we can make that ultimate option more palatable.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based substantially on a similar Bill that was introduced in 1998 by the Fine Gael interest in the House so this is obviously an area of long-standing interest to the party. However, as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="675"/>Parlon, explained yesterday evening, the Government cannot support the Bill, but its introduction has allowed us to examine a number of issues to which the Bill gives rise. I reiterate the commitment that the Government will have full regard to the points raised in this debate when it brings forward its own proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan expressed grave misgivings yesterday about the terms of the proposed section 14, which would allow the courts to direct the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to deduct sums from amounts payable to a defaulter. I very much share the misgivings of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, people in receipt of welfare payments with only a limited amount of income could have money deducted from them. The Bill also imposes the additional administrative burden on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs of setting out a protected rate of welfare payments. The costs involved with these proposals, to employers and the State, could create a significant problem. Therefore, Fine Gael has some lessons to take yet in the caring dimension as it embarks on its new arrangements with other parties in the House. Section 14 as it stands cannot be sustained.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and engage in further liaison with its prospective partners before it countenances the introduction of a section of this character.</P>
    <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s Bill would place very substantial administrative burdens on the courts and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, involving expenditure substantially disproportionate to the amount of the fines involved. It is no solution to attempt to solve the problems caused for the prisons by the need to deal with people who default on fines or debts just to create a host of problems for other agencies in the criminal justice system. I noticed that many Deputies in their contributions referred to the pressures on the criminal justice system and the commitment of the Government to substantially increase, within its lifetime, the number of personnel in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The reality is that no matter what alternatives to imprisonment are introduced for such cases, prison will have to <Col N="676"/>remain as the ultimate sanction in relation to the enforcement of fines or debts. However, I agree with those who said imprisonment must be the ultimate sanction, to be used only as a last resort. If there are practical and inexpensive ways to address these matters &mdash; Deputy Ring mentioned one in his contribution &mdash; they should be explored and developed.</P>
    <P>There may well be some scope with regard to the introduction of a carefully targeted attachment of earnings scheme in regard to non-payment of fines or civil debts. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the similar mechanism that exists in the context of the payment of maintenance under the family law legislation. However, the experience of the Courts Service is that the attachment of earnings orders under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 has been extremely time consuming.</P>
    <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd expressed concern last night for the plight of Deputy Joe Higgins, who, he argued, could have availed of such an arrangement to pay his local authority service charges rather than going to jail. I do not know if this is another attempt to extend the rainbow coalition even further, but I should point out to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd that Deputy Joe Higgins was not imprisoned for failure to pay his service charges.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited him in jail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was imprisoned because he was found to be in contempt of court through disobedience of a court order. Therefore, the coercive machinery of justice had to be brought to bear on him to comply with the orders of the court. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s putative rainbow was wrongly positioned in that respect. I note that Deputy Broughan visited Deputy Joe Higgins while he was in detention. It is one of the corporal works of mercy and I commend him for it. I regret to say that I did not visit my constituency colleague, but I was a Minister in the Government at the time and I could have been removed from office for not showing due regard to orders of the court, which we are obliged to uphold in this House and for which other Members have been censured due to their failure to obey on occasion.</P>
    <P>Even if the provisions of the Bill were practicable, it would be wrong to suggest that they would have an appreciable effect on the existing availability of prison accommodation. The number of people being committed to prison each year for non-payment of fines or debts is, as pointed out to the House already, in reality small, about 1% of the prison population or about 40 persons. It is right that we should examine what can be done to reduce this number. The Government is committed to bringing forward practical measures in this regard. The Minister&rsquo;s contention is that the proposals before the House do not represent workable solutions in this area. The various expert reports have effectively concluded that we need to introduce improved means of assessment to ensure that fines imposed are <Col N="677"/>within the means of the offenders to pay them. To this must be allied a facility to allow offenders to pay fines by instalment thus allowing a means of enforcing fines other than by way of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Since the last Fine Gael proposal in this area in 1998, the Government has been active. The Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, published this week, contains two proposed Bills to deal with fines. The fines Bill, while providing primarily for the updating and indexation of fines, will also provide for a mechanism to strengthen the means assessment procedure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing has been done in six years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;used by the courts in assessing a person&rsquo;s ability to pay the fine. The Deputy is well aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a powerhouse of legislation. Any fair examination of the annual volume of the Statute Book will demonstrate the enormous legislative production line of that Department.</P>
    <P>The second Bill is the enforcement of fines Bill and it is intended to end imprisonment where practicable for inability to pay fines and to provide for new ways of enforcing fines. The Minister is considering a range of alternative measures, but will only introduce such measures when he is satisfied they will improve the efficiency and the fairness of the system. The Courts Service is also examining a range of payment options for fines, including payment by credit and debit cards on the Internet, in banks and post offices, and by phone using lo-call numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends in the near future to bring to Government the fines Bill. This Bill will be primarily intended to update existing fines and provide a mechanism for indexation, but the Minister will also include proposals to strengthen the criteria to be used by the courts in assessing the means of the offenders before imposing fines. As I have said, the Minister&rsquo;s proposed fines Bill will include provisions for payment of fines by instalment. It is the intention, however, that such a payment arrangement will only be available to those who genuinely need it having regard to their financial circumstances and the amount of the fine imposed. More than one hundred thousand fines are imposed in the District Court annually. It would be untenable to suggest that every such fine could attract an instalment order. Huge administrative problems would arise for the Courts Service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to get a chance to say a few words on this Bill. I will take up on a couple of points the Minister made. First, he claims the Government has been active on this issue since it last came to prominence in 1998. This is 2004 and we are going into 2005. I would not call it action, but rather six years of inaction. The last time a Bill was brought in here was the <Col N="678"/>Private Securities Bill 1999 by a colleague of mine from County Meath, John Farrelly, under the same Department. As it came from this side of the House the Government decided it could not pass it. Six years later the Government brought it back and it was passed, but it is still not law. That is inaction. The people elect us. The Minister mentioned that the whole legal Department is a powerhouse of law. This House is a powerhouse of people who are here to make decisions. If we are allowed to make decisions we can change things. We are not allowed to make decisions and this is like schoolboy politics. The Government will not accept it because it comes from the Opposition. There is nothing wrong with this Bill. There might be a few technical things we can change if we work together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy wants to deduct fines from social welfare payments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a defect. It is a solution to a problem and we are willing to discuss parts of it. Yet because of the Government, there will be no discussion of it. This is wrong and is a pity. People elect us to do things, not to sit around here and play games.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister prefers to put social welfare recipients in prison, which is what is happening currently. We need a few solutions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am so annoyed as a young person to see that clever, common sense Bills cannot make it through. They have to be thrown out because it is an Opposition thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said prison should be the last resort and that if only 40 or 50 people go to prison because of inability to pay fines, that is no big deal. Prison is meant to be only for people who are a danger to society. It is fundamentally wrong to commit any 40 or 50 other people for any other reason. We should do all in our power to change that. We do not know what happens when people go into prison; they either become better citizens or worse citizens. I would prefer not to run the risk of them becoming worse. However, the Minister seems to be happy to put 40 or 50 people into prison every year for non-payment of fines because there are 1,000 places. That is not even to consider the cost of going to prison. We have to find a solution to this and I welcome this initiative. We have many other Bills being brought forward to reform the justice system, which is more than I can say about the Government. If we got the chance, we would act on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that the cost of implementing this Bill would be too high. Where are the figures to show that? The Minister should ask representatives from the Courts Service, the penal system, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. If cost is his argument in refusing our Bill, then he should prove it. Before this Bill is refused the Minister should talk to the people it will affect. I <Col N="679"/>guarantee that he has not done that. He will not do it, he will oppose for the sake of opposing it.</P>
    <P>The cost of prison is massive, as is the effect on people&rsquo;s lives. We have to do all in our power to keep people out of prison. Fines constitute positive equity, as someone will make money out of them. We are turning this into negative equity, as it is costing us money through the loss of the unpaid fine and the cost of prison. That is bad economics if nothing else and it has to be sorted out. This Bill shows how we can get these fines through other ways and through time. I am not stupid, I know someone can make an arrangement to pay a euro a week. A judge must also apply some common sense. There are other ways of getting the value of a fine out of a person on social welfare. I have no problem with the fact that a person might be on social welfare. We can get a number of hours of work out of that person. We have to start thinking up new ideas and it is time we started swapping information and working together, or we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>There is a big problem with prison spaces. We all know there is a shortage of places for criminals in our prisons. Any initiative that frees up places in prison has to be welcomed. We all know the problem that prison is not necessarily acting as a deterrent to many of those who go there. Two or three days does not really affect the hardened criminal. A big problem is that the criminal knows that he will not be in prison for a couple of years. Prison will have an effect if it happens soon after a criminal commits a crime, if it is an instant reaction. The person who commits the crime knows it will be a couple of years before he has to go to prison and so can almost book himself in. Therefore, prison is not having an effect on that criminal. If the same criminal thought that within a week of committing a crime he could be in prison, it would be a different story. That has been proven. We need to have prison spaces freed up. We need to get out of prison the 40 or 50 people who are not a danger to anyone.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where people are in prison for the wrong reasons. We need to welcome any opportunity to change that. This Bill is a step in the right direction. To knock the Bill because it comes from the Opposition is wrong and a shame. Ireland, as a young country, wants to move fast. We in this House are the slowest organisation in the country, yet we are in charge of running it. We just do not work together. We have to oppose for the sake of opposing, which is schoolboy and childish politics. It does not get things done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Members now have a clear choice. They can vote to continue a system that involves sending people to prison for non-payment of fines or debt. There were 37 individuals in prison last night because they could not pay fines or debt. That is the system this Government wants to continue. Well over 1,000 people will go <Col N="680"/>to prison this year for that reason. Six years ago, Fine Gael proposed to change the system. Since then, more than 10,000 people have gone through the doors of our prisons because they could not pay fines or debt. That is the system this Government tells us we should retain.</P>
    <P>I want to change that system. It is wrong, unfair, inefficient and costly. I cannot understand a Government that will not accept the principle of a Bill that aims to change that system by putting an alternative in place. Telling me that it will undermine the current system for collecting fines and that is why it must be rejected, is unacceptable. Of course it will undermine the current system. It will put a stop to the system whereby people are going to prison because they cannot pay fines. It will put in place a different system whereby they can pay by instalments or an attachment of earnings can be sought. I believe that is the better system because anything is better than the existing system. I am infuriated by what the Minister said in response to this Bill. He spoke of the need to be fair to the less well-off in society. What is fair about putting them in prison? That is the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats prescription for fairness for the less well-off.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge this is not a perfect Bill. The Minister accepts there is need for reform with regard to three different elements: first, improved means assessment by the courts to ensure fines imposed are within the means of the offenders to pay them; second, a facility to allow offenders to pay fines by instalment; and third, means of enforcing fines other than by way of imprisonment. This Bill contains provisions numbers two and three. I accept that it could be improved by an amendment in respect of improved means assessment by the courts to ensure fines imposed are within the means of the offenders. I am prepared to accept an amendment on that ground.</P>
    <P>Very legitimate points were raised on this side of the House, in particular by my colleague, Deputy Broughan of the Labour Party, and by other colleagues, including some within my own party, in respect of the attachment of social welfare payments. I accept that section 14 of the Bill may have to be amended somewhat. I am particularly taken by the argument from Deputy Broughan in respect of the UK experience and the need to ensure that subsistence incomes are not interfered with. I have no interest whatever in putting people on the breadline. My fundamental interest is to ensure that those people are not put in jail. I am prepared to accept amendments on Committee Stage which will improve this Bill and ensure a minimum subsistence income for those whom I will keep out of jail. I cannot accept the argument made by the Government that we should continue with the present system of putting them in jail as a fairer way to treat the less well-off.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to ensure that fines are collected. These fines are imposed by the courts and they are not penalty points-type <Col N="681"/>fines, not dockets issued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. They are fines imposed by a court where there is seven days or 14 days imprisonment in default of payment. The line coming from many of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, fed by the script factory, is altogether incorrect in its presentation. They have taken speeches that were delivered six years ago when the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, promised to change the system. It was to be changed immediately. The Opposition was asked to hold its breath and withdraw the Bill because it was to be done immediately. That was six years ago and nothing has happened. Instead upwards of 10,000 people were put in prison since that promise was made.</P>
    <P>We are being promised two further Bills and being asked to wait for them. Six years later I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s promises about legis<Col N="682"/>lation. There is no Bill listed in the legislative programme to be published this session. No heads of Bills have been approved. At the back of the list, there is one Bill that may be produced in 2005. There is no publication date for the other Bill to which the Minister referred. Those are the promises of the Government. In the meantime another couple of thousand people will be in prison as a result of the absolutely uncaring approach of the Government. I say, stop this practice, let this Bill through. I am prepared to accept reasonable amendments but let us be fair to the less well-off and let us put in place a system where fines, in particular, and debts can be paid and collected in a reasonable, humane manner. This practice of putting people in prison because they are poor must be stopped.</P>

   <Title>Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to present to this House the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003. The central purpose of the Bill is to deal with the transfer of the execution of sentences where the sentenced person has fled from the sentencing state to his or her state of nationality. The Bill gives effect to provisions in Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons as well as Articles 67- 69 of the Schengen Convention. Articles 67- 69 of the Schengen Convention have provisions that correspond to those in Article 2 of the additional protocol. Enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the additional protocol and to operate the relevant Schengen provisions.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The additional protocol and the Schengen provisions supplement the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The 1983 Convention has been given effect in Irish law by the 1995 Act of the same name. Under that Act, a national of one state party detained in another state party can apply for transfer to his or her country of nationality to serve out his or her sentence there.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements under the 1995 Act provide for the transfer of prisoners who are already in custody in the sentencing state. The Bill under discussion deals with a different situation. The new arrangements will, instead, provide for the transfer of the execution of the sentence. In other words, the sentence will follow a person who has fled from the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>One essential feature of the existing system under the 1995 Act is that it is the prisoner who initiates the process by requesting the transfer. The circumstances arising under this Bill are materially different from those covered by the 1995 Act. As I have indicated, in cases arising under the 1995 Act, the person is already in custody in the sentencing state and consents to return to the state of nationality. However, in the <Col N="684"/>circumstances covered by this Bill, the person has already fled from the sentencing state before serving the sentence and is now in his or her state of nationality. The issue that, therefore, arises is to ensure that the person serves or completes the sentence that was lawfully imposed in the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>The consent of the prisoner under the 1995 Act relates not to whether a sentenced person should serve the sentence but to the State in which it is to be served. In circumstances where a person has deliberately fled from the sentencing state and returned to his or her state of nationality, the person has in effect exercised his or her consent in relation to his or her return to the state of nationality. It is then a matter of ensuring that the person serves a sentence that was imposed by the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions in the Bill, I will set out the circumstances in which it will apply. The Bill will apply in two categories of cases. First, it can apply in the case of a person sentenced by an Irish court who has fled from this State to his or her state of nationality without either commencing or completing the sentence. In that case, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may request the authorities in the other state to enforce the Irish sentence.</P>
    <P>In the second situation, a sentencing state may make a similar request to this State in the case of Irish nationals who have fled back to this State prior to the commencement or completion of a sentence. Under this Bill a request from the sentencing state must receive the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before an application can be made to the High Court for a warrant for the person&rsquo;s arrest. The Minister has to be satisfied as to certain matters before an application is made to the High Court. In any event, the Minister may, having regard to all the circumstances, decide not to make an application. Following arrest, the High Court may make orders for the carrying out of the foreign sentence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures that we have an effective alternative to extradition. Currently, where a person flees from the sentencing state to his or her home state, the sentencing state has just one option if it wishes to ensure the sentence is served. That option is to request the person&rsquo;s extradition or, as the case may be, surrender to <Col N="685"/>another EU state under the European arrest warrant. Once this Bill is enacted, it will be possible for the sentencing state to rely on an additional option, that is, that the person should serve the sentence in the home state. That is a significant benefit to the sentenced person, while also ensuring that the sentence is served.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the arrangements covered by this Bill, as well as those covered by the 1995 Act, are intended to assist the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners who have been sentenced abroad, while also ensuring that the sentence is served. The person&rsquo;s rehabilitation and reintegration will be facilitated by allowing the person to serve the sentence in his or her home state, closer to family and without language and other difficulties. The Bill has 13 sections. I propose to outline the most significant of the provisions, starting with section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is an important section in the overall scheme being introduced by this Bill. It provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may by order designate countries that have accepted the relevant additional protocol or Schengen provisions. The order will identify the states with which Ireland will operate these arrangements. In other words being a party to the additional protocol or the Schengen Convention will, of itself, not be sufficient. Ireland must also be satisfied about the systems operated by the other state before it agrees to operate these arrangements with it. Ireland will not be operating these arrangements where it is not so satisfied.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the circumstances in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may request a country that has been designated under section 4 to take over the enforcement of a sentence imposed in Ireland where the sentenced person has fled from Ireland to that other country.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the Minister may consent to a request from a country designated under section 4 for the execution in this State of a sentence imposed in the sentencing country on a person who has now fled to Ireland. Before giving consent the Minister has to be satisfied that the person concerned is regarded as an Irish citizen; the sentence concerned is final; the sentenced person has at least six months of the sentence left to serve; the offence concerned would constitute a criminal offence if committed in the State, that is, dual criminality applies; and having regard to all the circumstances, it would be in order for the Minister to give his or her consent.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the procedure by which a sentence imposed in another state may be executed in this State. It provides for a certificate to be presented to the High Court by or on behalf of the Minister, indicating that the Minister consents to taking over the enforcement of the sentence. It also provides for an application to be made to the High Court for the issue of a warrant authorising the arrest of the person concerned. The High Court, on production of the certificate, issues a warrant for the arrest of the person if <Col N="686"/>satisfied there has been compliance with<?oasys _jy?>section 6.</P>
    <P>The ministerial certificate must contain certain information, for example, the name and address, where known, of the sentenced person and the sentence imposed on him or her.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out the procedures relating to the issue by the High Court of a provisional arrest warrant. This section gives effect to Article 68(2) of the Schengen Convention and Article 2(2) of the additional protocol. Those articles provide that a sentencing state may request the administering state, prior to the arrival of documents supporting the request and prior to the decision on the request, to take the sentenced person into police custody or to take other equivalent measures.</P>
    <P>An application can be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the provisional arrest of the person where a request has been made by a sentencing country. The application may be made to the High Court by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of inspector but only with the consent of the Minister. The Bill sets out the details that are to be included in the request for the warrant.</P>
    <P>A warrant endorsed under section 7 or 8 may be executed by any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any part of the State even if it is not in the possession of the member at the time. However, the warrant must be shown, and a copy given, to the person arrested at the time of arrest or within 24 hours thereafter. A person arrested under a warrant must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The High Court must remand in custody a person arrested under a provisional arrest warrant pending the production of a ministerial certificate referred to earlier under section 7. That certificate will indicate that the Minister has received and is consenting to the request from the sentencing state. If a certificate is not produced within 18 days of the person&rsquo;s arrest the person will be released. The release of any person will not prejudice his or her rearrest if a request for the enforcement of the penalty or detention order is afterwards made.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the High Court may make an order committing the person to a prison or St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for the purposes of serving the sentence or remainder thereof. Before making the order, the High Court must be satisfied about the matters I have listed under section 6, that is, dual criminality etc. In addition, the High Court will not make an order if it considers that the safeguard provisions in the Extradition Act or, as appropriate, the European Arrest Warrant Act are not being respected. In other words, a person detained under this Bill will have the same protections available to him or her as if he or she was being sought under an extradition request or a European arrest warrant.</P>
    <P>The effect of an order under section 9 is to authorise the continued enforcement by the State of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state <Col N="687"/>and means, in practice, that the whole or the balance of the sentence will have to be served in Ireland. In other words, it will have the same effect as if it were a sentence imposed here. It will not be subject to appeal in this jurisdiction since that remains the prerogative of the sentencing state that imposed the sentence and since the Minister and High Court have satisfied themselves that the sentence to be served here is final under the law of the sentencing state. In all other respects, the sentence will be served in the same way as a sentence imposed here and subject to the same rules, including remission and temporary release. In addition, allowance will be made for any time served pending the making of the order or in respect of any part of the sentence already served in the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>Section 9(3) provides that the Minister may apply to the court to adapt the duration of the sentence to conform with our law if the sentence imposed by the sentencing state is greater than the maximum term to which the person would be liable if he or she had committed the offence in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 9(4) provides that any element of a sentence as imposed, excluding duration, which renders the sentence less favourable than one to which the person would be liable had he or she been convicted in the State for a similar offence will not apply if the High Court so directs. For example, Ireland will not impose penal servitude even if the original sentence provided for this. Enforcement of the sentence ceases where the State is notified by the sentencing country that the person would be entitled to be released under its law. The person will be released unless his or her continued detention in Ireland is required as a result of a sentence imposed here or the person has been remanded in custody in respect of an offence committed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the Criminal Procedure Act 1993 shall not apply to a person who is detained under this Bill. The 1993 Act provides for judicial review of certain convictions and sentences, presentation of petitions, the grant of pardon on the grounds of miscarriage of justice and payment of compensation by the State. Such proceedings would not be appropriate in the circumstances covered by this Bill, since the events, witnesses, evidence, etc. are outside the jurisdiction and are not amenable to the Irish courts. However, the Bill does not prevent the person pursuing such an action under the law of the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that no proceedings under section 3 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 will be taken against a person who is imprisoned here under this Bill. Section 3 of the 1976 Act provides that a person who escapes from any lawful custody in which he or she is held in Northern Ireland shall be guilty of an offence. Section 11 therefore avoids a situation where the person could be liable to serve not only a sentence imposed in Northern Ireland but, in <Col N="688"/>addition, could be proceeded against under section 3 of the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures fugitives serve their sentences. It also reduces the risk of Ireland being seen as a safe haven for fugitives. The provisions also have advantages for the prisoner in that they offer an alternative to extradition that may be more favourable to the sentenced person and they also facilitate the family and relatives of the sentenced person by easing visiting arrangements and other contacts.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains effective safeguards. The consent of the Minister is required before a request can be processed and the Minister will have discretion to decline requests where he or she is not satisfied with or has concerns about the arrangements being proposed in any particular case. In any event, Ireland will operate these arrangements only with states in whose systems we have confidence. I would also stress that a person may be arrested and imprisoned here only with the consent of the High Court. The High Court is required to ensure the extensive safeguards available in extradition or European arrest warrant cases are also available to persons arrested under this Bill. In addition, a person can be imprisoned only if convicted of an offence that corresponds to an offence under Irish law. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is a moderate measure but I give it my full support. In many ways, international co-operation is the very factor which has given rise to this legislation. It relates back to a protocol of the Council of Europe convention. As a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, I am glad to see that the work of the Council can still find practical expression in the parliaments of its member states.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Bill will ensure that persons who are brought to justice and then abscond will not be able to evade their punishment. A number of instruments are available to deal with that and this will be one further instrument. From that point of view, I am very supportive because crime and criminals know no boundaries. Our responses, therefore, must also know no boundaries. It is an aspect of globalisation that increasingly there is cross-border crime and people move from one country to another. Therefore, our responses must always be updated.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that there will be much resort to this particular measure because the approach generally adopted at present is to seek extradition. There has been the transfer of sentenced persons. Perhaps in his summing up the Minister of State might give an outline as to what use has been made of the provisions of the 1995 Act with regard to the transfer of sentenced persons. The Parliament and the public would like to know to what extent that Act has been availed of, how many people have transferred from Ireland to other countries and to where, and how many people have come from other countries and <Col N="689"/>have served or are serving their sentences in Irish prisons. It would be helpful to have a picture of what has emerged since the 1995 Act. It would also be helpful if the Minister of State, possibly with the advice of his officials, could give us an idea of the extent to which he believes this particular measure will have an operational life. I do not anticipate that much use will be made of it but it may possibly be a useful additional measure in the fight against crime, particularly in dealing with fugitives who abscond.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I feel it is unlikely to have much impact is that it seems only to apply after somebody has been sentenced. The Minister of State might also deal with this in his summing up. Normally when somebody is sentenced, they are in court and are delivered into immediate custody so the question of absconding should not normally arise. Is there a suggestion that this Bill, when it is enacted into law, may have an impact in a situation where sentences are imposed <i>in absentia</i>? What, in practical terms, does the Minister of State see as happening under the terms of the Bill?</P>
    <P>The other issue that arises is the extent of the network. Have all the other member states of the Council of Europe adopted this provision? Has it been ratified in all these other states? What is the situation in a country that has adopted but not ratified it? What would be the situation of France, for example, dealing with Ireland now, before the Bill has gone through? To make the Bill effective with regard to any other country, is it necessary that it be adopted and ratified by both the sentencing country and the country of the nationality of the person sentenced? That information would be useful.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on another aspect not covered by the Bill, but which, if we found a mechanism of dealing with it, would allay much public concern. It relates to known criminals who have relocated elsewhere and about whom I frequently see stories in the newspapers. I think particularly of those who have relocated to countries such as Spain and who continue to be involved in flooding this country with drugs from their Spanish base. One has a sense of frustration and helplessness at the continuance of this situation, whether from Spain, Holland or any other country. We get the impression that these people are untouchable. I would like to see thought and consideration being given to how we can get at these people. We must continually update our ideas and approach, whether nationally or through international arrangements, in order to deal with developments on the criminal end of matters. This new development is a cause of grave concern. The fact that these criminals seem to be able to virtually publicly flaunt their situation, with their big houses and haciendas abroad, while openly engaging in international crime, particularly in the drugs area, is a cause of grave concern. I would like this Government, during the short time remaining to it, to come up with some ideas for dealing with this problem. In many <Col N="690"/>ways, the type of activity about which I speak is more serious and of far greater concern to the public than the type of activity being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that I have any problem with the Bill. As I already stated, it is a modest measure that will provide an additional instrument in our armoury for dealing with crime where a fugitive absconds before completing his or her sentence. While the notion of somebody absconding before completing a sentence gives rise to pictures of jail breaks and other incidents of that nature, we have fortunately not had many such incidents in recent times.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the Bill the Minister might clarify is the provision in section 4 which gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs power by order to designate a country that has adopted the protocol or the Schengen provisions. The idea is that the order will identify the states with which Ireland will operate these arrangements. Can the Minister of State make us aware of the thinking in that regard and which countries he expects to be part of that?</P>
    <P>The Bill contains principles with which I concur. It has been carefully drafted by the Department and contains the relevant safeguards from the point of view of the State and individuals involved. I like the approach which involves providing the High Court with the necessary powers in that regard. Overall, I endorse and fully support the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, is here. We always seem to end up facing each other across the Chamber. Given his work over the past couple of years in his previous portfolio, I commiserate with him that my many suggestions that he be elevated to the Cabinet were not listened to by the Taoiseach. He will be much missed in the marine area.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present because I get few opportunities to discuss matters with him in the House. Like most Deputies, I correspond with him and inform him on important issues of security and policing that confront our constituents. However, I rarely get the chance to speak to him in the House on those matters and it is disappointing that I cannot do so today.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the session when we look at the legislative programme it is hard to see where the Department puts its priorities. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources have both got amazing lists of pending legislation on their different lists as well as legislation before the Houses. It is astonishing how the programmes have not been addressed. There is a change in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources now with its new Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. There is no change in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. <Col N="691"/>However, the gamut of legislation in the legislative programme before us on each Order of Business &mdash; Deputy Stanton took a number of opportunities to read into the record the long list of legislation pending from the Department &mdash; illustrates the unsatisfactory situation whereby, for example, in this Administration the Garda Bill has not been addressed and passed by now. Many of us on this side of the House have been calling for this Bill to be addressed year after year and feel we should have had a comprehensive Garda Bill within the past seven years.</P>
    <P>I note that on the just published &ldquo;A&rdquo; list there are three Bills: the Criminal Justice (Co-operation) Bill; the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill which issued yesterday; and the Registration of Deeds and Titles Bill, which are all important. We also have Bills on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; list that have been cleared by Government and are with the draftsman: the criminal justice Bill; the protection of confidential information Bill, which replaces the Official Secrets Act; the defamation Bill, which is also important; and the prisons Bill, which apparently arranges for the privatisation of prison escorts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has approximately nine Bills before the House, including the Bill before us. An astonishing 20 Bills, the heads of which have not yet been approved by the Government, are also being worked on in the Department. In our previous discussion today we had an excellent effort by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe to modernise and rationalise crime legislation with the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill. We also had a famous ground rent Bill which Deputy Woods, in my constituency, promised would be brought into law within weeks of the establishment of the 1997 Government. However, we are still waiting, as Deputy Sherlock said this morning. I do not believe the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will do anything about ground rents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We can be quite sure of that. Another Bill will be promised before the next election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Bills on which the heads are not approved are the immigration and residents Bill, the intoxicating liquor Bill, the parental leave Bill, the Garda Bill and the prison service Bill. The latter two cover two of the most fundamental organisations in the country in the security area. I accept the argument that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is probably the most important Department because without security a community has nothing. Security is the absolute requisite for a civil life. However, we are still waiting for the Garda Bill and the prison service Bill which deal with the two most fundamental organisations in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is not earth shattering nor will it have major implications. It will affect fewer people than the Minister of State&rsquo;s Law of the <Col N="692"/>Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001 which cleared in the Seanad in that year but which we still expect to debate in this House perhaps three years later. I already mentioned the prison service Bill. Who sets the priorities for the Department? Why is so much legislation promised? The Minister is famous for his soundbites. However, very often his comments relate to the affairs of other Departments, including Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs and Defence. He has a view on every Department. However, how does he set the priorities for this Department? It is his job to recruit the necessary staff. Staff work under extreme pressure because it is the most important Department with a difficult remit. My party is unhappy with the manner in which the legislation is introduced by the Department and with the lack of prioritisation of key Bills.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party generally welcomes the Bill. It complements the Sentenced Persons Act 1995, which is based on the 1983 Council of Europe convention. People should have the opportunity to serve the balance of their sentences in their native states and it is correct that fugitives should serve their sentences. Many Members have experience in this area as a result of the debates on repatriation and following contact with Irish people in other states who sought repatriation.</P>
    <P>There are concerns about the transfer of prisoners, particularly through this jurisdiction. Last May the Minister, in response to Senator Henry, stated Ireland would only facilitate the transfer of prisoners in accordance with the law. Has this commitment been met? The journalist, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, recently reported that prisoners from Iraq had been transferred through our jurisdiction on a Gulfstream jet.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Legitimate questions can be raised about the manner in which prisoners have been treated in our jurisdiction and whether our legal system has been sullied by such outrageous treatment. The Department must address this.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, piloted the Bill through the Seanad, my party colleague, Senator Tuffy raised a number of important issues. Several were addressed through amendments but our justice spokesperson, Deputy Costello, may wish to return to one or two issues on Committee Stage. Senator Tuffy asked whether an occasional report to the Oireachtas could be provided under the Bill, similar to other legislation. Concerns were also raised about the issue of correspondence of offences under section 3, given that similar offences are treated differently under other legal systems. There can be different nuances in the interpretation of the law in other states.</P><Col N="693"/>
    <P>Sentencing policy in different countries is an issue. The Minister of State said the issue had been addressed under section 3(3) and 3(4) so that prisoners who wish to return to their own countries can do so. Section 6(3) refers to a ministerial direction if less than six months have been served and uses the phrase &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;. It states: &ldquo;The Minister may in relation to a person sentenced to less than six months in a sentencing country or who has less than six months remaining to serve give his or her consent under section 1 if he or she considers exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the person serving the sentence or the remainder of the sentence...&rdquo;. The Minister might elaborate on this in his reply. We will examine it again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The High Court must be satisfied that a request has been made on behalf of the sentencing country but, under section 8(7), that is presumed to be the case unless the opposite can be proved. Concerns have been expressed about this provision. The legislation also implies that, while there may be less favourable sentencing regimes or legal procedures in other countries, our courts cannot examine them. The Minister stated the Criminal Procedures Act 1993 does not apply in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a modest proposal for international co-operation to permit fugitive prisoners to serve their sentences in their countries of origin. It will not necessitate major work or resources on the part of the Department, although, traditionally, a dilatory approach to the repatriation and transfer of prisoners has been adopted based on my experience representing citizens in my constituency. If that continues, most applicants under the legislation will have served their sentences before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of the Bill is to deal with the transfer of the execution of sentences where the sentenced person has fled from the sentencing state to his or her state of nationality. In the circumstances covered by the legislation the person has already fled from the sentencing state before serving the sentence and is now in his or her state of nationality. The issue that arises, therefore, is to ensure the person serves or completes the sentence lawfully imposed in the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies in two categories of cases. It can apply in the case of a person sentenced by an Irish court who has fled from this state to his or her state of nationality without commencing or completing the sentence. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may request the authorities in the other state to enforce the Irish sentence in such a case. With regard to the second category of cases, a sentencing state may make a similar request to this State in the case of Irish nationals who fled here prior to the commencement or completion of a sentence. This provides an alternative to the more cumbersome extradition procedure when dealing with an absconded prisoner. Currently, when a person flees from the sentencing state to his or her home state, the sent<Col N="694"/>encing state only has the option of instituting extradition proceedings if it wishes to ensure an imposed sentence is served.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the legislation is likely to be a minor increase in the number of prisoners in Irish jails. I broadly welcome the legislation, the enactment of which will enable Ireland to accede to the additional protocols to the 1983 Council of Europe convention. I hope the Minister will respond to the concerns raised.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department will be more energetic and seek the necessary resources to bring forward the significant tranche of critical legislation that awaits our attention.</P>
    <P>I noted yesterday that the Taoiseach in his review of the achievements of seven years of Government spoke at length of the significant fall in crime of the order of 17% or 18%. After the debate, I had a quick glance at the report on crime statistics for the first quarter of the year, with which Deputies are provided through the good offices of the Department. When one looks at the level of crime, one finds it is still shocking, appalling and horrific. The Minister of State who is from another urban constituency will agree with me. That there was a murder every seven days up to March 2003 and every eight days up to March 2004 signals to me that we continue to have an horrific level of crime in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>While there were insignificant falls in other categories, the overall level of criminal events recorded on the PULSE system and brought to the attention of the Department is in excess of 100,000. I have asked the Minister to reform the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s report and to ensure that we receive Central Statistics Office figures. In a recent speech at Templemore, the Minister said he intended to ask the CSO to compile crime statistics. If we rely on surveys as the <i>Sunday Independent</i> did some time ago, we find that crime is up to 80% worse than appears to be the case in the crime statistics. A Minister who has time for comments on every subject under the sun is presiding over dreadfully unsatisfactory circumstances and is failing to run his Department efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>As I attended a constituency meeting during the past week, my car was broken into. Many of us have these experiences every day and every week and we want dramatic action from the Government. On balance, one must consider that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have been moved in the Cabinet reshuffle to provide us with a more dynamic Minister. There are a great many issues arising from the crime statistics that I want to take up with the Minister when he is next in the House. We need a much more dynamic approach to the policing of our community.</P>
    <P>Security is the most important aspect of any citizen&rsquo;s life and it must come through the community. For that reason, I am waiting for the Garda Bill in which we will at long last get joint committees and policing plans to allow locally elected representatives to work with superintend<Col N="695"/>ents in Garda districts to produce policing. Deputy Finian McGrath and I have some experience of this. Policing must come from the people and communities but I get no sense that the Minister understands that. If anything, he is very anti-community. I ask him to adopt a much more vigorous attitude towards outstanding legislation which it is vital to pass as soon as possible. The Minister must at last begin to deal with the horrific level of crime occurring in our community. Having said that, I commend the Bill which the Labour Party will support.</P>

	<P>On the first occasion on which I sit across from Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe as Minister of State, I congratulate and compliment him on his appointment. The Bill before us is welcome and represents one of a raft of legislative measures in this area that have been implemented in recent years. Such measures have covered extradition and serving of sentences in a prisoner&rsquo;s home country. I look forward to having an input into this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Now that we have cross-Border and inter-country co-operation we should introduce a procedure whereby the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs could support Irish nationals who find themselves as victims of miscarriages of justice abroad. I raise the case of a constituent of mine who has been in this invidious position for quite some time. Christy McGrath from Carrick-on-Suir was convicted in Britain in July 2000 and is serving a life sentence. Christy represents a prime example of a case of miscarriage of justice. Many people believe, as he does, that he is innocent including his family and Members of this House yet he finds that apart from some support from the Irish embassy there is little real support for a prisoner who finds himself in circumstances of this nature.</P>
    <P>Christy McGrath has repeatedly denied that he was responsible for the death of Gary Walton and he is asking for an immediate appeal to permit him to overturn his conviction. Mr. McGrath was a jockey in England and had a very promising career. Unfortunately, he was involved in an altercation in a County Durham village in 2000 and found himself attacked by another individual. He defended himself and went home only to find that Mr. Walton died later. Mr. McGrath was arrested, charged and convicted of Mr. Walton&rsquo;s murder though certain evidence never came to court. As a young Irishman in England, Mr. McGrath found himself confused and isolated. Pressure was put on him on the day of the trial to change his plea from not guilty to guilty on the basis that if he failed to do so, he would receive a 25 to 30 year sentence. Isolated as he was and <Col N="696"/>in the absence of permission to consult with his family, he agreed to change his plea with the result that he finds himself in his current position. Many individuals who are prepared to testify on Mr. McGrath&rsquo;s behalf have not been heard and other evidence has not been provided. Many, some of whom sit in this Chamber, and include the new Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and Deputies Lynch, Harkin, Costello, Collins, James Breen and myself as well as 49 MPs in the United Kingdom believe that Mr. McGrath is innocent and that his case represents a serious miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>In implementing legislation such as the Bill before us we should put in place a mechanism through which cases like that of Mr. McGrath can be dealt with and prisoners and their families supported in seeking appeals. Mr. McGrath and his family want an opportunity to prove his innocence in court. All the evidence suggests that he is innocent. I ask the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the new Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, to use their good offices on this case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. Before getting into the details of the Bill, on a personal level I congratulate Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe on his promotion to Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I wish him well for the future. On a political level, I am disappointed by the number of senior Ministers representing the north side of Dublin, an area which needs a great deal of support and development.</P>
    <P>It is important we set down a number of ground rules when dealing with matters related to prisoners, their sentences and the issue of justice for all. Our justice system should always be based on making amends to society and respect for human rights. Any country, state or society that ignores these markers loses the respect and support of its people. This was notable recently in relation to Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and the nightmare hostage issue. Violence, abuse and the slaughter of hostages and prisoners should never be an option in political conflicts throughout the world. That is a marker for us all. We should agree to fundamental rights and principles and never stray from them. We should also defend and protect lawyers, Deputies, Senators, councillors, human rights groups and others who take risks for human rights. We must ensure we have a humane and fair justice system. Great people like the late Pat Finucane immediately come to mind. He paid the ultimate price for his dedication and work for human rights. These are the issues which should be debated in the House today, particularly in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in the case of a person sentenced by an Irish court who has fled from this State to his or her state of nationality without <Col N="697"/>commencing or completing his or her sentence, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may request the authorities in that state to enforce the Irish sentence. In the case of Irish nationals who have fled to this State from a sentencing state prior to the commencement or completion of a sentence, the Minister must give his or her consent to a request from the sentencing state before an application can be made to the High Court for a warrant for that person&rsquo;s arrest. The Minister will be required to satisfy himself or herself as to certain matters before application is made to the High Court. The criteria include a discretionary provision whereby the Minister may, having regard to all the circumstances, decide not to make an application and, following arrest, the High Court may take orders for carrying out of the foreign sentences in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In debating this legislation we must also show compassion and understanding for the victims of prisoners, an issue of which we should never lose sight. It should remain top of the political agenda. The Killester Resource Centre in my constituency was recently opened by the President. Some 37 prisoners from Mountjoy Prison were involved in work on that project. It is a magnificent centre located on the Howth Road, Killester. Two of the prisoners working on the project were released from prison before its completion and they returned on their own time to complete a wall they were involved in building. That is an example of prisoners repaying their debt to society under the supervision of people like Mr. John Lonergan and through creative and imaginative programmes to develop society.</P>
    <P>When discussing the issue of prisoners we should remain conscious of our duty to prevent crime and deal with its causes. Many children from violent and dysfunctional homes are at risk of ending up in Mountjoy Prison. If we do not intervene to assist children from such families, no one will, an issue on which I have made submissions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and have raised in my capacity as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. It is these types of issues we should discuss when considering this legislation. Children at risk should be our priority because they are the prisoners of tomorrow. We have all seen the damage prisoners have caused to many communities throughout the State. It is not an option to spend &euro;250,000 per year on keeping a young child imprisoned when a little creative thinking and early intervention could do more. While there has been much discussion of the issue of educational disadvantage, we must deliver services to those who need them. It is no use intervening when children reach 12 or 13 years of age. The damage is already done and they are on their way to prison. We must intervene when they are between three and five years old. Pre-school and junior infant teachers are able to name those children at risk of ending up in Mountjoy Prison in future. We must face reality, be brave, take risks <Col N="698"/>and provide the necessary resources to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Spending &euro;250,000 on keeping a child locked up and providing an inner city school with approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 a year for projects is not realistic intervention, as I know from experience. I worked in a small school in the inner city for approximately 20 years. That school received a grant of between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000 a year to assist children at risk. The grant was used for after-school projects and art therapy to try to turn violent children away from crime. Such projects had a major impact on the community and the school. They are the types of issues we should discuss in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which contains many positive provisions. However, there is no point introducing legislation, speaking with prisoners and dealing with international situations if we do not deal with the real world on our own doorstep.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I wish him and his colleagues elevated to high office well.</P>
    <P>Many of the remarks on Fine Gael&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill earlier today could well be repeated verbatim in regard to the legislation now before us. I will deal with the details of the Bill later. I agree with Deputy Healy&rsquo;s comments about the case of Christy McGrath, the Irish jockey in custody in the UK. I hope the Minister of State will re-examine that case at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is commendable and practical, provides that convicted persons can serve sentences in jurisdictions other than their own. It addresses and reflects in a down to earth way the increased mobility and travel patterns which characterise the world today, an issue which I would like to discuss briefly. In particular I would like to address the way Shannon Airport is being used for the transfer of prisoners from one jurisdiction through our national territory to a third jurisdiction. I refer in particular to a plane with the call sign N379P which it is known is under charter to the US military. It is known that this plane has abducted and transported al-Qaeda suspects on behalf of the US Government. It is also known that this private aircraft has landed at Shannon Airport several times. It is unclear, however, if the plane has contained al-Qaeda suspects when in Ireland. Has the Minister asked the US military if that is the case? It is not good enough for the Government to operate a do not ask, do not tell policy or for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to cover his ears and mouth about prisoners travelling from different jurisdictions landing on Irish soil. I want the Minister to ask such questions.</P>
    <P>Three months ago, Senator Henry asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if he could assure us that untried and unsentenced people are not being brought through Shannon <Col N="699"/>Airport from goodness knows where to Guantanamo Bay. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, assured the Seanad that any person on Irish soil is entitled to the protection of the Constitution. The garda&iacute; in Shannon, however, tell us that they do not inspect US aircraft; they are operating a do not ask, do not tell policy and that is not good enough. It is not good enough that prisoners who have not been charged and who may have been abducted are possibly landing on Irish soil without the Government paying a blind bit of attention.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Government to tug its forelock to the US Government or any other Government that is guilty of human rights violations. I single out the US Government because we know about its record in regard to an executive jet with the call sign N379P, which has landed at Shannon Airport. Will the Minister assure us that untried prisoners are not landing on Irish soil? It is a seminal human rights issue and while we are discussing sentences for prisoners in other countries, we should pause to think about those who may be landing on Irish soil.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am concerned about four sections of the Bill. There is provision in section 5 that the Minister can make a request under exceptional circumstances for the sentence to be served if less than six months remain. Those exceptional circumstances should be defined and we would like the Minister to clarify them in his reply. Similarly, section 7 states that a person arrested must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible. The phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; is ambiguous. It should be clarified and a specific timeframe set.</P>
    <P>In section 8 there is reference to a specific timeframe of 18 days regarding a person arrested under a warrant being brought before the High Court as soon as possible, and the High Court must remand the person in custody pending the production of the Minister&rsquo;s certificate. If this certificate is not produced within 18 days, the person must be released. That is too long a period in this instance. With today&rsquo;s technology, such as the fax machine and e-mail, it should be possible to reduce this period to seven days, a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>Under section 9, the Minister may adapt the duration of the sentence to conform with our law if the sentence imposed by the sentencing state is greater than the maximum term of imprisonment to which the person would be liable if the same offence was committed here. Would this also be guaranteed in the case of other countries? That is not clear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a practical Bill but there must be clarification of those four sections. I hope the Minister will look beyond the detail of the Bill and consider the issues I raised about aircraft that may have suspects on board landing at Shannon Airport. We should not turn a blind eye to that.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the calls for Christy McGrath to be released. He is another victim of a miscarriage of justice in Britain. While we are discussing the Transfer of Execution of Sentence Bill, we should think of the situation if the Birmingham Six or Guildford Four had managed to make their way to Ireland. If the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Des O&rsquo;Malley, or someone as enthusiastic about locking up republicans or anyone associated with republicanism, had been in charge, their sentence would have been executed in an Irish prison. That is why we must be extremely careful in dealing with such a Bill that safeguards exist. If Ministers as enthusiastic as former Deputy Des O&rsquo;Malley and others about locking up republicans or any other class of people are to have the powers granted under this Bill, there must be safeguards in place.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that in the case of a person sentenced by an Irish court who has fled from Ireland to his or her state of nationality without commencing or completing the sentence, the Minister may request the authorities in another state to enforce the Irish sentence as an alternative to extradition. Equally, in the case of Irish nationals who have fled back to Ireland prior to the commencement or completion of a sentence, the Minister may consent to a similar request on the sentence and the High Court may make orders for the carrying out of the foreign sentence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the State has an obligation to ensure the protection of the human rights of Irish people in the case of a request for extradition from this jurisdiction for the serving of a sentence imposed by another state. The State also has an obligation under international law to protect and guarantee the human rights of persons who might be required to serve a sentence imposed by an Irish court in a foreign prison system. I note some of the safeguards in the Bill, for example, that the offences involved must be offences in Ireland &mdash; that is welcome &mdash; and that the Minister must specifically designate the states that can avail of the provisions, which means that others may be excluded. I have a problem in that the presumption is that all EU states would qualify because no abuses of human rights occur within the EU according to the states themselves. We must be careful not to create a category that excludes all states within the EU.</P>
    <P>Will the safeguards in the Bill be sufficient to ensure the full protection of the human rights of sentenced persons or will its provisions be too weak and imperil the rights of those individuals? Does this Bill allow the State&rsquo;s security concerns to override our rights or does it strike the correct balance? We should tease this out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Republicans have our response to this Bill given the history of hardship endured, especially by loved ones, as a result of unjust imprisonment in British, other foreign and Irish jails over many decades of our struggle. Any legislation that will reduce the likelihood of people being forced to <Col N="701"/>serve time in foreign prisons, and thus reduce the hardship faced by their families and facilitate their reintegration into their home communities on release, is welcome. However, I note that the Human Rights Commission has raised a number of concerns about this Bill which, if they have not been taken on board by the Minister before now, will be submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in in the form of amendments on Committee Stage. Since the Minister for injustice is so fond of guillotining debates, especially on Report Stage, before substantial amendments proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in are reached, thereby preventing the public from hearing our concerns about the legislation, I will take the opportunity to raise the matters now, particularly those we share with the Human Rights Commission.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State address those concerns one by one in his closing remarks and state whether the concerns of the Human Rights Commission have been taken on board or how they will be dealt with? In its submission to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June, the Human Rights Commission recommended that this Bill be amended to include a provision compelling the Minister not to issue a request for the execution of a sentence in another state where there are grounds for believing that the conditions of detention in the requesting state are seriously deficient and are likely to result in the sentenced person being exposed to conditions constituting torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission believes that the Minister must also have special regard to the family status and the right to family life of a person subject to the relevant sentence. The commission also recommended an amendment providing that, in acceding to a request from another country to execute a sentence in Ireland, the Minister should direct in all cases that the term of sentence to be served in Ireland should not be longer than the maximum sentence under Irish law in respect of the corresponding offence and to remove the existing discretion of the Minister to request that a higher sentence imposed in another state be imposed here.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission has also called for the introduction of additional safeguards requiring evidence from a requesting state of the commission of the relevant offence by the person, subject to the request of transfer. It also recommended that the period of 18 days for the remand of a person before the production of a certificate is required should be reduced to seven days. In the age of telecommunications and the Internet there is no reason it should take 18 days to prepare such a certificate and transport it to the Minister in question.</P>
    <P>The commission also proposes that an explicit reference be included in the Bill for rights to apply for bail as well as the right of access to professional legal advice. It believes the Bill should be clarified to provide that the High Court must ensure that the sentenced person has been <Col N="702"/>afforded an effective right of appeal and-or a review of the sentence before an order can be made directing the execution of that sentence in Ireland. We will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage but will seek to amend it on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify whether the proposals of the Human Rights Commission have been taken on board by the Government, whether it intends to do so or, if not, why they have been rejected? The current system in respect of the repatriation of prisoners who have been sentenced abroad is very bureaucratic and this Bill should improve the position. If people sentenced in Ireland wish to be repatriated to a prison in Britain or Europe, we should make the process as easy as possible so that they can enjoy some semblance of family and connection with the community in which they will settle on release. We should expect the same from other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with a case which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform initially rejected, although I hope he will examine it again. The case concerns an Irish citizen who, because he did not live in Ireland prior to his sentencing, has been refused repatriation despite the fact that his family and those to whom he is connected now reside in Ireland. We need to consider such personal experiences when dealing with this Bill rather than deal with it coldly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, and his colleagues at senior and junior ministerial level who have been appointed in the past 24 hours and wish them well in the execution of their duties in their respective Departments. It is a great honour to be appointed a Minister of the Government at any level. It is an indication of the trust placed in the Member by the people and the chief executive. It is an historic landmark in the life of a Member of Parliament and it behoves us to recognise that fact. It is also important that, in doing so, we give due respect to the various offices even if we occasionally lower the guard in the heat of battle in the House. That does not mean we have any disrespect for the offices, nor should we. I extend my personal congratulations to the Minister of State opposite. If his late father-in-law were alive, he would be very proud of his appointment.</P>
    <P>This Bill incorporates a number of changes and makes various references to the Schengen agreement. Will the Minister of State clarify whether countries which are not signatories to that agreement are covered by the transfers envisaged by this Bill? A number of countries, particularly our next door neighbour, the UK, are not signatories but I presume that, because Ireland is proceeding with the legislation, it must apply between Ireland and the UK and other countries which are not signatories to the Schengen agreement.</P>
    <P>Having been involved in a number of cases of repatriation of prisoners and miscarriages of <Col N="703"/>justice, particularly in the UK, I am certain the Bill has considerable merit and can improve the position. Other speakers have referred to the conditions prevailing in the country in which the sentence might be served and whether they conform to proper standards, which is as it should be. We need to provide that prisoners are treated humanely and in accordance with their sentences.</P>
    <P>It is important that evidence be produced in the case of a miscarriage of justice or a particularly harsh sentence, for example, where particular circumstances were not taken into account at the time of the sentencing. There should be a procedure whereby this can be reviewed with a view to establishing on a statutory basis provisions whereby, once the transfer is sought, if the person was guilty, he or she would not have his or her sentence reduced just because he or she made an application for a transfer. However, if he or she was not guilty or there were extenuating circumstances, they could be examined in a different light. This is in the context of issues which have been raised many times in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to revisit the cases such as those of Annie Maguire, the Guildford Four or the Birmingham Six which the House has discussed at length. There were extenuating circumstances in some of those cases, although not necessarily in all of them. We must keep those matters in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated the Bill would ensure we have an effective alternative to extradition and that a sentence will effectively follow a prisoner who flees. How will a prisoner manage to flee to another jurisdiction after sentence has been passed? I presume the Minister of State will elucidate. While I accept these circumstances will arise occasionally, I am curious to learn how such absconding will occur to any great extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said: &ldquo;I would like to emphasise that the arrangements covered by this Bill, as well as those covered by the 1995 Act, are intended to assist the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners who have been sentenced abroad, while also ensuring that the sentence is served.&rdquo; The basic tenet of this approach is excellent. We do not sufficiently emphasise rehabilitation, which is important. Several speakers queried the benefit of prison on the basis that conditions and peer pressure result in prisoners obtaining PhDs in crime, which is not the purpose of the system. Insufficient time and effort is invested in rehabilitation, although I accept that efforts have been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some of those sent to prison, particularly young criminals, have an ambition to develop and perfect their knowledge to enable them to indulge in a life a crime. It is a serious problem when young men openly state in radio interviews how important it was for them to have a string of offences as long as one&rsquo;s arm or that they had managed, from the age of 12 or 14 years to their early 20s, to get through the system with scarcely a conviction. They speak of being brought to court where they were given various benefits and <Col N="704"/>discharged. As a result, these young men have acquired a long string of qualifications which have given them the wherewithal and qualifications to pursue a life of crime and avoid and challenge the law. Society must face this problem.</P>
    <P>It is also true, as the governor of Mountjoy Prison has repeatedly stated, that certain deprived areas of our cities and towns keep our prisons full and provide the prisons and courts with employment. Deputy Finian McGrath and other speakers raised this issue which we should examine to ascertain if and how we can eliminate its causes and identify at an earlier stage what happens when a young person gets out of control. Every Deputy will have dealt with many of the countless cases of young people, particularly young boys, who have been deemed out of control. For some unknown reason, the Courts Service does not appear to be in a position to deal with them and they are shifted around from pillar to post until they become fully fledged adults, geared to carry out a life of crime. Although they often start off committing petty crime, they graduate to serious offences against the person and so forth.</P>
    <P>A further exceptional area of rehabilitation is the treatment of sex offenders. It is important this is available in prisons, particularly in circumstances where offenders will be released. A prisoner who is repatriated may well be released without society becoming aware of the fact. For reasons beyond our control and, it appears, the control of the authorities in the United Kingdom, many prisoners convicted of serious sexual offences in Britain and released have subsequently committed further serious crimes. I do not need to remind the House of recent examples.</P>
    <P>It is essential that rehabilitation programmes are available in the original sentencing state and the state to which a prisoner indicates a desire to transfer. In addition, prisoners must pursued a programme throughout the incarceration period. It is equally important that where prisoners are transferred to another prison to serve the remainder of their sentence, similar facilities are available and the rehabilitation programme is continued.</P>
    <P>Given the changing circumstances in other European countries, it is important that information on a released prisoner&rsquo;s place of residence is made available to the authorities, although not necessarily to local people given what we know happens in such circumstances. If the whereabouts of a person is not known, he or she could re-offend and create serious problems. I emphasise this requirement because of a specific case in the United Kingdom in recent years in which failure to pass on information from one region to another resulted in a catastrophe. While I am aware an inquiry was held which apportioned blame, we must still learn to do this correctly because we may end up transferring a problem from one part of Europe to another.</P><Col N="705"/>
    <P>I cannot refer to juvenile crime without raising the lack of juvenile detention places. Most of the petty crime we deal with is carried out by young boys who become notorious in their respective areas. A couple of years ago, a young boy of 14 or 15 years of age, referred to as &ldquo;the young general&rdquo;, revelled in the notion that he was following in the footsteps of the great man. Folklore attaches to such people in their own areas where they can probably terrorise people, pull off strokes, cod the Garda and do all sorts of other things. When they go to court they greet the judge because they have been before the court previously. They can continue to go through the turnstiles without ever being detained because there are insufficient places for them.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how what is allegedly one of the wealthiest countries in the world cannot provide a simple facility to incarcerate young hooligans for their own good and that of society. A rehabilitation programme should be established to help them and, in turn, the community. We have been discussing this matter since I entered the House, which was not yesterday, but have not yet made any worthwhile progress. We have got a few extra places in various locations. Every now and again Ministers mention this, and the current Minister has repeated it several times. This area is the responsibility of at least three Departments, namely the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and this is one of the reasons nobody accepts responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental flaw in our crime prevention system because it is in this system that young criminals start off, obtain their credentials and qualifications and learn to expect everyone to look up to them and say how tough they are.</P>
    <P>I hope we can focus on these basic needs and requirements because if we do not we will be forced to do so at some time in the future and we will have to imprison offenders at a later stage for longer periods and for more serious offences. There is no excuse in the world for the fact that one can be brought before the courts for five or six years and always be able to go free because of circumstances outside the courts&rsquo; control, such as a lack of custodial spaces. The main foci are custodial spaces, the rehabilitative programme and the need to ensure that the place to which a prisoner is being transferred treats prisoners properly and that the place whence they are transferred has treated him properly in respect of sentencing.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;A warrant endorsed under sections 7 or 8 may be executed by any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any part of the State even if it is not in the possession of the member at the time.&rdquo; I remember having referred to this previously in respect of other legislation. The Minister continued: &ldquo;However, the warrant must be shown to, and a copy given to, the person arrested at the time of arrest or within 24 hours thereafter.&rdquo; I can understand why this provision is included. For instance, it may be possible to <Col N="706"/>identify the prisoner, escapee or fugitive, as they are called, at a precise moment, but it may not be possible to obtain the warrant within the same period. In order to ensure the prisoner does not escape forever and a day, it should be possible to issue the warrant as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Minister stated that a person arrested under a warrant must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible. Other speakers have also made reference to that. I presume it means that the person should be brought before the High Court as soon as possible after the 24 hour period has elapsed.</P>
    <P>It is important that the warrant is shown to the person whether he or she is being extradited or not, in this State or elsewhere. It is important to recognise that in the event of a person being arrested, the warrant needs to be available and issued sooner than the 24 hours specified by the Minister. I hope some consideration might be given to this at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In general, I do not have great difficulty with the legislation but I have used this opportunity to emphasise certain points. I believe they are fundamental to the preservation and recognition of our laws because there is, whether we like it or not, a serious threat to the public. The public has expressed the view that it does not feel safe walking the streets. This should not be the case and until such time as there is recognition by all, particularly by criminals and young potential criminals, that if they disobey the law and erode the rights of others in the course thereof, there is a price to be paid. We should never justify the actions of a criminal who bashes in a door and beats up an elderly person, for example. Once a person does something like this there should be a place to put him and a rehabilitative programme leading to his recognising that what he did was wrong and that there is a price to be paid for it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for his very kind and generous remarks on my appointment as Minister of State. I assure him that I look forward to working with all Members of this House in my new role.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is away on Government business, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate. I have taken note, as have the officials, of the comments made in the debate. The Minister will give those very considerable remarks very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of some of the essential features of the Bill and the arrangements it introduces. As the Minister said in his opening remarks, enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to accede to the additional protocol to the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. It will also enable Ireland to operate a certain part of the Schengen convention package into which it has already opted. The arrangements covered by this Bill are <Col N="707"/>intended to assist the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners who have been sentenced abroad while also ensuring the sentence is served. The person&rsquo;s rehabilitation and reintegration will be facilitated by allowing the person to serve the sentence in his or her home state, closer to family and without linguistic and other difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also ensure we have an alternative to extradition. Currently, where a person flees from the sentencing state to his or her home state, the sentencing state has just one option if it wishes to ensure the sentence is served, namely, to request the person&rsquo;s extradition. Once this Bill is enacted, it will be possible for the sentencing state to rely on an additional option, namely, that the person should serve the sentence in the home state. That is a significant benefit to the sentenced person while also ensuring that the sentence is served.</P>
    <P>The Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will consider the various issues raised. I know Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, in his contribution, questioned the numbers transferred under the 1995 Act, which followed on from the 1983 convention. The figures available to me, as of September 2004, indicate that 102 prisoners have been transferred into the State, 57 prisoners have been transferred out of the State, 266 applications for transfer have been received by the State and 182 applications have been made for transfer out of the State. It is very important to put those figures on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe asked why this legislation is being introduced. It is part of the commitment Ireland has accepted under the Schengen convention. The Deputy also asked if it would apply only where a person was convicted in his or her absence. Generally, it will apply to persons who have escaped or otherwise fled from the sentencing state. Deputy Durkan referred to this matter at length.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe also questioned section 4. Under this section, Ireland will apply the systems with states that are designated. Designation means that we must be satisfied with the criminal justice system in the sentencing state. A designated state must have ratified the protocol but that is not of itself enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan gave a general welcome to the Bill and indicated he would be putting forward amendments for Committee Stage. These will be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy again raised the case of Irish nationals abroad where a miscarriage of justice may have arisen. In my capacity as co-chairman of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I met the family and other persons concerned about the detention and sentencing of Mr. McGrath, a native of Tipperary, who is being sentenced in England. I know that Deputy Healy, along with some members of the House of Commons in Britain, has been very active in campaigning to discover if Mr. McGrath got justice <Col N="708"/>or not. Having read up on that case, it is one that concerns me as a possible miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finian McGrath gave a general welcome to the Bill and also mentioned the wider preventative aspects. Deputy Cuffe thought the Bill commendable and made some comments on transit through Shannon. Those points have been noted. There is a requirement of 18 days for receipt of requests after provisional arrest and that is too long according to Deputy Cuffe. The situation is that it is the same period as under the Extradition Act. Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to safeguards and human rights protections. I assure the Deputy and the House that the same safeguards are available as under the European arrest warrant, including respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. The Minister will put forward appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the Schengen agreement. This agreement applies in all EU member states, Iceland and Norway, but not in Ireland and the UK. Both Ireland and the UK are in the process of joining part of Schengen, which includes the present proposals. The Bill is necessary to provide the proper legal basis for these arrangements. Deputy Durkan again stressed the importance of rehabilitation and this is the central aim of this particular legislation. Deputy Durkan also referred to the details of a production of a warrant. These provisions are the same as under the Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform drew attention to the safeguards of the Bill in his opening remarks. There are several of them and they are significant and substantial. I emphasise those provisions that ensure that we will operate the arrangements in this Bill only with states whose systems we trust, and that the safeguards available to someone who is the subject of an extradition request or a European arrest warrant also apply under this Bill. I reiterate that the Minister will be giving further consideration on Committee Stage to some of the issues raised in the thoughtful contributions of the Members. I am pleased to commend this Bill to the House.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    <P>The affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress and the Part V mechanism are major elements of the Government strategy for the provision of social and affordable housing and are expected to deliver substantial output over the coming years. In addition to longer established programmes, which are operating this year with total Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding of &euro;1.8 billion, this represents a significant and growing investment in social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>To date, under Part V agreements with developers, a total of 315 social and affordable housing units were acquired by local authorities up to the end of June 2004. Part V continues to gather momentum. A total of 2,500 social and affordable units are now planned or proposed. It is clear that the Part V measure is now bearing fruit and that it will contribute significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Under the affordable housing initiative, substantial progress continues to be made. Part V affordable units are an important contribution to the initiative. Furthermore, over 50 projects on State and local authority lands are planned. It is projected that these projects, together with some 2,100 affordable units coming under Part V, will deliver a total of approximately 8,900 units to the <Col N="710"/>initiative. My Department is currently engaged with a number of other Departments and State agencies with a view to securing further land to reach the agreed target of 10,000 units.</P>
    <P>Construction has commenced on the Finglas Road site which will yield 160 housing units, 80 of which will be delivered next year. A number of other projects has been advertised for expressions of interest, including the St. Bricin&rsquo;s military hospital site which was advertised as part of the O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens redevelopment and will eventually supply 200 housing units. Following a shortlisting process, it is understood the request for proposals for the St. Bricin&rsquo;s site will be issued next month.</P>
    <P>The Jamestown Road and Infirmary Road projects were advertised last week and will yield a combined total of 465 housing units. All projects are being progressed as a priority with activities being paralleled as necessary with a view to early delivery of units.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the necessary structures have been put in place at central and local level to oversee and expedite projects with a view to early delivery of housing units. It is not possible, however, to dispense with mandatory planning and procurement procedures which necessarily take some time to complete before construction commences.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to work with the parties to the pay agreement to expedite effective implementation of the initiative. There is a strong commitment in Government to deliver on this initiative and the substantial progress made to date emphasises this commitment. I am satisfied that both measures are an effective response to housing needs, particularly for first-time buyers, and will result in an increased supply of social and affordable housing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State to deal with my question which relates specifically to the commitment made by the Government with the social partners under Sustaining Progress. I do not want him to use the three card trick system and lump the Part V development in with the commitments made. The commitment under Sustaining Progress was for 10,000 extra houses. After the mid-term review of the agreement, how many houses have been completed to date and how many will be completed by end 2004? Will the Minister of State project the more caring attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il by giving us guarantees that not only will he meet the commitments made under Sustaining Progress, but also address the issue of 50,000 families on local authority waiting lists throughout the country, many of whom are waiting up to eight years for housing? Can I have specific answers to my specific questions on the promises made to the social partners under Sustaining Progress?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I combined both questions together in my reply. The Deputy is probably trying to zone the matter down to the State-owned <Col N="711"/>sites. No houses have been built on those yet. The first announcement on them was in the summer of last year. As we all know, any developer in the private sector will tell us that from the time they buy or acquire possession of a site to the time the first house is built is about five years. The 10,000 houses promised included the 8,900 sites which have been identified from the 50-odd patches of Government land. They also include what is coming from Part V. Therefore, 315 units have already been provided under Part V and a considerable number, 2,500, are proposed. Some 1,056 units are in progress and 1,400 are proposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not one house has been built under Sustaining Progress.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>An extra 10,000 houses were promised.</P>

	<P>Deputy Allen should wait until he is called upon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and Part V. However, on the matter of the 50-odd sites offered by the Government for the programme, the first announcement was in the summer of last year. No physical work has commenced on those yet. I mentioned that two of them, Infirmary Road and Jamestown Road, sought expressions of interest in the newspapers last week. That is how it is <Col N="712"/>being done. There will be much progress from now on and much work is going on behind the scenes. In the real world it takes at least five years from the time people buy a site to the time the first house is produced. We hope to beat that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>In the real world people would build a house in five years if they were using a teaspoon rather than a JCB. The Minister of State used the term &ldquo;momentum&rdquo; with regard to the affordable housing programme. Would he describe it as &ldquo;good momentum&rdquo; that in four years since Part V came in, a total of 315 houses have been provided? Would he describe it as &ldquo;good momentum&rdquo; that the promise of 10,000 affordable houses, which was made to the social partners in Sustaining Progress, has today turned out to be a promise of only 8,900 houses, of which none has been built and on which no work has been started? Some 10,000 affordable houses were promised under Sustaining Progress and the Minister of State says 2,000 affordable houses are promised or planned under Part V, a total of 12,000 houses. How many of them will be constructed in the lifetime of the Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have replied to those questions. A total of 315 have been built to date under Part V.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a disgrace. They could be built in a few months.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 1,056 are under construction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In Wicklow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and 1,438 are at different stages of planning. Three affordable housing schemes are in operation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We know all that. How many will be built in the lifetime of the Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No houses have been produced under what the Deputy regards as the Sustaining Progress initiative on Government-owned land. It takes time to get such schemes up and running. Last year 2,600 units were constructed under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should stick to the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to outline the complete picture.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>How many houses will be built before the Government leaves office?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 2,600 were built last year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true. A total of 315 have been built in four years.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="713"/>
   <?oasys _cl10.7-?><Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the number can be increased this year so that between 2,500 and 3,000 affordable houses will be built per year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We can expect, therefore, that the maximum number of houses that will be built if the Government runs its full term is between 5,000 and 7,000. Is that correct?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is approximately half the number the Government told the social partners it would produce in the lifetime of Sustaining Progress, which expires in less than 18 months.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year 2,600 affordable houses were built. We expect that number to increase to 3,000 per year. The 10,000 houses promised under Sustaining Progress will be built. A substantial number of houses will be not be completed on Government-owned land until 2006 or 2007 and it is expected that approximately 3,000 a year will be built on these sites. I do not know when the Government will leave office and perhaps not all of the 10,000 houses will be built by then but they will be under way and that is important.</P>
    <P>Under Part V, builders and developers have secured many planning permissions and they are working on many sites. The value of these developments will not be achieved on day one. They still have a stockpile of planning applications.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>One could expect more than 315 houses to be built in four years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No, one would not. The Deputy must realise how the system works.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>if he remains committed to one of the key housing priorities contained in the national development plan, namely increasing social housing output to meet rising needs.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22908/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding for housing under the national development plan has to date exceeded the projected figures set in 2000. Total expenditure on housing from January 2000 to the end of 2003 at just under &euro;5.32 billion was 10% ahead <Col N="714"/>of the national development plan estimates set in 2000. Despite significant progress in output, it has not been possible to achieve a number of the physical output targets due to higher than anticipated construction costs.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce five-year multi-annual capital investment programmes provides an important opportunity to ensure a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all social and affordable housing programmes. Consequently, to maximise the benefits of this multi-annual approach, local authorities have been requested to prepare five-year social and affordable housing action plans. These action plans are being assessed by my Department in consultation with local authorities and will be agreed by end of 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government has been responding to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. Last year the highest output under the range of social housing measures for more than 15 years was delivered. It is estimated that total social housing output last year, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, met the needs of approximately 13,600 households compared with just over 8,500 households in 2000.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Government&rsquo;s spending on housing is on responding to the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives. It is anticipated that, through these measures, the needs of more than 13,000 households will again be met in 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State only answered part of my question. He must have thought he was still dealing with the media in so far as he replied to a question that he felt I should have asked. I asked about increasing social housing input to meet greater need. Is social housing stock in serious decline, particularly as a result of local authority tenants buying their houses? How will social housing need be met? The deputy city manager of Dublin City Council has proclaimed that he would like to get away from social housing provision altogether.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister of State is not addressing this issue, why does he refuse to meet Opposition party spokespersons on housing to discuss it? I have sought a meeting with him but I have not been offered such an opportunity. Do we have a say on this issue? Does he not believe that what we say counts for anything? We are not looking to him to come into the House to read out reams of statistics. That will not house the 48,000 families on local authority waiting lists.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister of State do to increase social housing output to meet increased demand? A promise was made in this regard in the national development plan but it has not been kept. Waffling on about statistics means nothing. The lack of provision of social housing under Part V has been mentioned. Social housing is only being provided in token numbers. What will happen? What <Col N="715"/>is the position of the Minister of State on meeting Opposition party spokespersons to discuss this issue?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authority housing stock is not in decline. It has increased to approximately 105,000 units but many local authority tenants have been buying their houses under the sale scheme for years and the rate of construction has not met the demand under the scheme. However, I fully support the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those houses are not being replaced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of the scheme but the houses should be replaced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department&rsquo;s thinking relates to building units but it is also very much about building sustainable communities. The Department&rsquo;s deeply held view is that tenants should aspire to buying their own homes because it is a significant move in putting down roots. We do not wish to return to schemes that were run in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>A submission by Dublin City Council has been received by my Department but it has not reached my desk. It was made by the members, a number of which represent the Deputy&rsquo;s party, not the manager. I am a little surprised that the Deputy and councillors from various parties, including my own, have engaged in letter writing and media interviews about this issue. I wonder whether this initiative emanates from certain people working for the council or the city council itself.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the reason for the delays in introducing legislation promised in 2003 to enable major infrastructural projects to be fast-tracked through the planning process; and if incinerators will be included in the type of projects to be defined in the legislation.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22673/04]</QRef><Col N="716"/>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has been examining the development consent legislation to ensure we have the best possible system for the timely and cost effective delivery of infrastructure. There is a wide consensus that Ireland should have a regulatory system for major infrastructural projects which delivers infrastructure in the right place at the earliest possible time and on budget while mitigating its effects on the environment and people. Such projects should also comply with all relevant national and international legal requirements. Having examined the problems which have arisen in this area, we consider that legislation is desirable to address issues arising in the approval process.</P>
    <P>Due to the complexity of the issues involved and the need to consult widely among my colleagues, the preparation of draft legislative proposals has taken some time. The legislation is now, however, at a very advanced stage. In advance of the Government making a decision on these proposals, it would be inappropriate to elaborate on their detail including details of the types of national infrastructure which may be included in the proposed legislation. In general terms, it is intended to reduce the time required for obtaining development consent for necessary major public projects and to co-ordinate and streamline the different procedures involved while respecting the requirements of environmental and heritage protection and the need for adequate public consultation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>This fast-track legislation which was promised over a year ago appears to have hit the slow lane. It is commonly known that the delays have been due to major differences between Ministers with Deputy Cullen in favour of including incineration projects. I congratulate Deputy Roche on his appointment as Minister, which perhaps makes it a little premature to ask him his personal opinion on whether incineration should be included in fast-track legislation. What is the Minister&rsquo;s overall view of incineration as part of waste management policy?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Allen for his good wishes. As every Member of the House is aware, the waste framework directive as amended establishes the basic principle of dealing with waste in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way. To the degree that is possible, there is a waste hierarchy of reduction, reuse, recycling and recovery of which we are all aware. The use of modern, clean thermal facilities with heat energy recovery constitutes an important part of any sustainable waste management policy. Landfill, which we still use to a predominant extent, should and will be used only for residual waste. This extensive policy is supported in the programme for Government and very much accords with my views. After all, I live in and represent a county which has featured more than most in the context of the dreadful waste disposal problems we have.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to see the garden of Ireland despoiled further. A coherent policy must be <Col N="717"/>introduced and a willingness to deal with the problems demonstrated. Deputy Allen does some disservice to the legislation in this very complex area. We are all aware of the complications which have arisen and we are aware of the need for the legislation to which the Deputy referred. The initial proposals for this legislation were announced in July 2003. It is a difficult process and to establish the correct balance takes time, but we are working on the legislation and we will produce it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what the Minister meant when he said I was doing the legislation a disservice by asking relevant questions. Surely, that is my job. The Minister raised the issue of illegal dumping in the garden of Ireland. Is he prepared to ensure the local authority will take all necessary steps in the courts to deal with some of the significant players who have been involved in illegal dumping? Among them are some very big names which I will not mention. The Minister has made many statements about illegal dumping in Wicklow and said the full rigours of the law should be used against major companies. As he is now the man in charge, will the Minister put his words into action?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Allen is correct. I have taken a great interest in this issue and been to the forefront, particularly in my county, in highlighting the problem and requiring local authorities to take action. That is widely accepted. I was not alone but was one of a handful of public representatives involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen asked whether the large as well as the small players should be prosecuted. It is my belief that nobody is above or beneath the law. Its full rigours must be visited upon those who have done so much environmental damage. It is simply unacceptable that the burden of dealing with their past behaviour should fall on taxpayers. To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I will be as active as before in promoting this position in County Wicklow and elsewhere. Where there has been transgression, I will insist the existing legal base is used with effect by local authorities to prosecute such action as is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen asked specifically about incidents in Wicklow. I have been to the fore in encouraging a position in which local authorities prosecute irrespective of status or size. I pay tribute to Deputies Cullen and Noel Dempsey and to those who have not been in office but have been as concerned about the matter as I have. I assure Deputy Allen that the energy I put into the issue as a mere councillor will be reflected in my efforts as Minister. As recently as today, I have made it clear that I expect action to be taken in the areas outlined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister can say he expects action to be taken, the major weakness of local authorities is that they lack the resources for enforcement. Will the Minister ensure not only that legal action is taken irrespective of the size of the groups involved, but also that local auth<Col N="718"/>orities are provided with the resources to beef up their enforcement sections? Across the country, the weakness is that there is a lack of personnel and resources to enforce the planning laws.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While I hesitate to disagree with Deputy Allen, I must disagree with him on this matter. Over the not too distant past, there has been a failure of willingness rather than of resources to deal with this issue. I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to public representatives from my party and others who were indicating concerns for up to five years before action was taken. That is not good enough. As was highlighted in an RTE programme, where members of the public or political members of local authorities indicate concerns, there should be active pursuit of those involved in illegality.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there has been no indication that the problem is one of resources. The Deputy will understand that it takes time to put together a case which will hold up in the courts. While we all accept that evidential requirements are very strong, there is full encouragement from my office to all local authorities in this regard. If local authorities feel there is a particular resource issue, I would like to hear from them. In the past, the problem has not been in this area.</P>

     <Quest>if he has received the report of the NESC on housing and building land; when it is expected that the report will be published; if he has completed his consideration of the results of the research he commissioned from a company (details supplied) into the ownership and control of building land in certain development areas, particularly Dublin, to determine whether current practices are retarding the overall delivery of building land or impeding long term market stability; when the results of the research will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22973/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department continues to examine possible measures to moderate land costs for housing and other essential public infrastructure with a view in particular to identifying policy initiatives capable of early implementation to deliver an increased supply of affordable housing. This touches on the issues debated in the House earlier.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, my Department is considering in detail recommendations contained in the ninth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on the subject of property rights. My Department is also considering the report on ownership and control of building land which was commissioned from Goodbody economic consultants. As Members of the House will know, the National Economic and Social Council has conducted a major study on housing and land policy and its report, which is expected to be finalised shortly, will also be very relevant <Col N="719"/>in this regard. As already indicated, it is intended to publish the Goodbody report in conjunction with the NESC report.</P>
    <P>Given the positive work the NESC has done, we should await the publication of its report with great interest. Certainly, I do. Past reports on housing produced by the NESC have been models in terms of the writing and the logic which underpinned them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleague, Deputy Allen, in congratulating Deputy Roche on his appointment as Minister. I wish him well in office.</P>
   
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the Goodbody report, which was commissioned by his predecessor rather than the NESC, has been in his Department since last December.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While I appreciate he has had less than 24 hours to consider its contents, his Department has had nine or ten months to do so. Why is the report not being published? Will the Minister give the House a commitment that he will publish it? Can he shed any light on why the NESC report is taking so long? An article in a newspaper some weeks ago purported to contain a version &mdash; I do not know what validity attached to that version of the report &mdash; of what was included in the NESC report, including a recommendation that State assistance be provided to first-time buyers by way of deposits on houses and on certain measures related to multiple home ownership and so on. Is a row in the NESC between certain interests delaying publication of the report? Is the Minister prepared to ask the NESC to publish the working documents under consideration by it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl10.7-?><Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to speculate on whether there have been disagreements within the NESC and if that explains the delay in publishing the report. There are diverse views within the NESC. The Deputy will be aware from the procedures to which the NESC operates that papers will be circulated. It was always my understanding that the NESC report was due in the autumn and in that regard it is not that overdue. I believe it is worth waiting for given that past reports on this area by the NESC, in its previous guises, have been worthwhile. I am not in a position to comment on whether the press reports are a preview of what will be contained in the final report as it is not yet available to me.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the Goodbody report was completed last year. I think it was completed in December 2003 though I stand to be corrected on that. However, that was but one input into what is a multifaceted approach to studying the particular problem. Deputy Gilmore can be assured it will be published with the NESC report. When we have both reports, they can be considered in totality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why can it not be published separately? The Goodbody report dealt with a specific dimension of this problem &mdash; the ownership of development land in the Dublin area. The <Col N="720"/>report of the all-party committee on building land is in the public domain. What is the secrecy surrounding the Goodbody report? It was never intended that the report would go to the NESC although I am sure it is interested in the report and would receive it when published. Sending the Goodbody report to the NESC is a delaying tactic and an excuse for not publishing it. I appreciate this is the Minister&rsquo;s first day at the Department. He is a fresh pair of hands. Given that we do not know when the NESC report will be published, will he consider publishing the Goodbody report as soon as he has had an opportunity of studying it? I do not see any reason that report should not be in the public domain.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made a reasonable suggestion. I do not believe there is an obvious intent to obfuscate the report nor do I believe there is much point in taking an incrementalist approach in this regard. I will take the Deputy&rsquo;s point on board should there be any undue delay in publishing the NESC report.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>the information available to his Department on the progress made regarding the vitrification of the highly active liquid waste stored at the Sellafield complex; when it is estimated that the process will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22594/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The vitrification plant at Sellafield, which came into operation in 1991 with two vitrification lines, encapsulates the liquid high level radioactive waste held in storage tanks at Sellafield into glass blocks. This is a more stable form of storage and reduces the risk of leakages and subsequent radioactive contamination of the environment.</P>
    <P>As a result of technical problems with the vitrification plant, throughput performance over the years has been well below that expected. One could say the same about BNFL. However, my Department understands from the relevant UK Government department and the UK health and safety executive that improvements have been made to the original two vitrification lines and that because of these improvements, throughput has increased steadily. A third vitrification line aimed at increasing vitrification capacity has recently gone into full operation.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, British Nuclear Fuels Limited was given a direction in January 2001 by the UK health and safety executive&rsquo;s nuclear installations inspectorate to reduce, by way of vitrification, the amount of liquid waste in the storage tanks to a small buffer stock volume by July 2015. My Department understands that BNFL continues to comply with this direction and is on track to meet the 2015 deadline. The <Col N="721"/>Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has been asked to maintain contact with the UK&rsquo;s nuclear installations inspectorate with a view to monitoring progress in regard to the deadline.</P>
    <P>The RPII and the Government are concerned about the continuing storage of this highly active waste in liquid form in tanks at Sellafield and have been pressing, and will continue to press, the UK authorities to accelerate the rate of vitrification. This liquid waste arises from the reprocessing operations at Sellafield. As such, the need for vitrification will ultimately cease when the production of the liquid waste also ceases. The Government will, therefore, continue to use available avenues, both diplomatic and legal, to bring about an end to reprocessing operations at Sellafield, an issue on which all sides of the House are in agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister satisfied with the June-July 2015 target for completion of the vitrification process? Does he have a view on how much that deadline, which is 11 years away, could be reduced? Can he give a commitment to the House that he will pursue with the UK authorities a shortening of that deadline?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that 2015 is a long time away. As Keynes once said: &ldquo;In the long run, we are all dead.&rdquo; This and successive Governments have been concerned about the risks associated with highly active liquid waste and have encouraged the acceleration of the vitrification process. I will remind my UK colleagues on every occasion of the concern of Members on all sides of the House and of people throughout the island on this matter. I will take on board Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s advice should the opportunity present itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>When I raised this matter with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor I was told the UK authorities and, specifically, British Nuclear Fuels continue to refuse to grant the inspectorate of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland access to certain areas of the plant. Perhaps this Minister will use this opportunity to speak with his British counterpart in an effort to gain full access for the inspectorate to areas of the plant closed to inspection.</P>
    <P>I know that security arrangements are not available for public consumption but I have asked and suggested on a number of occasions that the Taoiseach be briefed by the British Prime Minister on the adequacies of security at Sellafield against terrorist attacks. During my last visit to Sellafield I was concerned about the admitted increased levels of discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea in the future and with the lack of information regarding adequate security measures. As a sovereign State which could be affected by any incidents at Sellafield we are entitled to such information.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy. A judge of the Canadian High Court made the point many years ago that the light of public scrutiny should <Col N="722"/>be allowed to fall into all areas of public administration, and that applies in the case of BNFL to all areas of Sellafield. Both the Irish and British public will be greatly assured if there is independent observation and scrutiny of what happens in that plant. It would be good if the authorities could adopt a more forward looking and progressive view. I will take any opportunity available to me to impress that upon my British colleagues.</P>

     <Quest>the progress made to date with regard to his Department&rsquo;s consideration of the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on property rights; his views on the findings of the committee that legislation can be introduced to cap the price of building land without the requirement for a constitutional amendment; if he intends to introduce legislation to give effect to this recommendation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22559/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 5 of today in which I indicated that my Department will consider together the ninth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the report on ownership and control of building land from Goodbody Economic Consultants, and the forthcoming report of the National Economic and Social Council on housing and land policy, with a view to proposing policies which can be implemented quickly and would deliver an increased supply of affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution concluded that, having regard to modern case law, it is likely that the central recommendation of the 1973 Kenny report &mdash; that land required for development by local authorities should be compulsory acquired at existing use value plus 25% &mdash; would not be found to be unconstitutional. Based on this assessment, the committee recommended that this designated area scheme should be re-examined with a view to its implementation, following such modifications as are necessary or desirable in the light of later experience.</P>
    <P>The committee also identified a number of different mechanisms that could be considered as an alternative to the designated area approach to recover betterment, including development levies, planning gain and new taxation initiatives. It has also been suggested that, notwithstanding its view on the constitutionality of the Kenny pro<Col N="723"/>posals, change along the lines recommended in 1996 by the Constitution Review Group &mdash; that existing constitutional provisions concerning property rights would be replaced by a single new provision &mdash; may be desirable. That will require constitutional change.</P>
    <P>Overall, these recommendations raise complex legal, financial and practical issues which merit and are receiving careful consideration by my Department. In particular, the designated area scheme proposal would have significant implications for the role of public authorities and the operation of the building and, especially, the housing markets. In this regard, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution explicitly acknowledged that even if the constitutional issue was settled, practical concerns about the proposed scheme would require rigorous analysis.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the operation and future potential of Part V of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 2000 as a mechanism for the provision of social and affordable housing should be emphasised. As a public representative, I have indicated concerns about the slow pace at which it has moved but it is now making progress. Following its amendment in December 2002, activity under Part V has increased significantly. More than 300 social and affordable housing units were acquired through Part V agreements in the first six months of 2004, and it is anticipated that some 500 units will be provided over the full year. This compares with delivery of only 46 affordable units in 2002 and 163 social and affordable units in 2003. I accept that those are low rates of completion, but everyone who has experience in this area knows that planning permissions that are already in operation were not covered by any element of retrospection. More than 2,400 social and affordable units are under construction or proposed on foot of Part V agreements, and significantly increased output under Part V is expected to continue over 2005. Like many public representatives, I have spoken to the planning authorities in my own area and urged more delivery under the Part V process which is a good system but has still not been fully tested.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating the Minister &mdash; comhghairdeas d&oacute; &mdash; and I hope we enjoy a better relationship with him than with his predecessor.</P>
    <P>This report was handed over in April but its substance has existed for more than 30 years, since the report of Judge Kenny in 1973 identified exactly the same solutions. I agree with the Minister that the constitutional view of the committee, albeit based on the advice of senior counsel, has not been tested. Part V, however, has been tested in the Supreme Court and that has addressed much of the constitutional issue. To implement this report, therefore, the Government, specifically the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, must deliver on this issue.</P>
    <P>The problems that pertained in the early 1970s in housing have multiplied several fold in recent <Col N="724"/>years. Successive Governments since the report was published have done nothing, although the crisis was not as serious then as it has become in recent years. Will the Minister indicate when the report of the committee will be dealt with? Is there a timeframe? Is the Department actively examining it? The Taoiseach welcomed the report when it was published.</P>
    <P>I am discouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Part V that he hopes it will remedy all the problems in housing. That part of the Planning and Development Act was gutted by his predecessor, leaving it worthless. It is no longer an option for local authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no magic bullet solution to this and we must be honest about that. If there were, some Minister would have solved the problem at some point over the years. Deputy Morgan is right that there is a pressing need. One of the by-products of extraordinary economic success has been that although we have produced record numbers of houses, these difficulties still continue to exist.</P>
    <P>The Kenny report has been debated over a long period. The contention that the constitutional issue has melted away is questionable. It would be subject to further test. I have already outlined the process I have envisaged, with the reports from Goodbody Economic Consultants and the NESC being published at the same time. I hope that will be done as quickly as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a date for that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not venture to give a date 23 hours after my appointment but I will try to ensure there is no undue delay.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has been in office less than 24 hours, this is an area about which he should have a view and he should share that with the House. Does he agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contention when he decided to refer the issue of private building land to the all-party committee that the cost of building land is at the heart of high house prices and must be addressed? Does he accept that the Taoiseach referred the issue to the all-party committee to establish if there was a constitutional impediment to dealing with this through legislation? Will the Minister bring legislation before the House to deal with the high cost of building land, which now contributes 45% to the price of the average new house in Dublin?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I seldom disagree with anything the Taoiseach says, particularly not on my first day in office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is still in the comfort zone.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a self-evident relationship between the problems of the supply of building land, the cost of building land and the thorny <Col N="725"/>issues of zoning and services. It is not a simple issue. Notwithstanding the basic conclusion of the all-party committee on the constitutionality of the designated area scheme and the Kenny report of 1973, it is only one of a range of possible measures that might be undertaken. The committee itself identified various possible alternatives to designated area schemes recommended by the Kenny report and touched on issues such as development levies, planning gain &mdash; which issue I have mentioned on more than one occasion &mdash; and taxation incentives.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the forthcoming NESC report on housing and land policy will identify further possible measures to promote better affordability. All of these possible options will then have to be carefully operated. Given the constituency I represent, which is next door to Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s, I am acutely aware just how pressing this issue is for many of our constituents and am anxious to see progress made as rapidly as possible. I anticipate the NESC report with interest and we will see where we can go from there. I do not want to see any undue delay.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the mysteries of my political life over the past 23 years has been why the provisions of the Kenny report have not been implemented and why we still have archaic rules regarding ground rents. The answer is that vested interests have stifled Governments into inaction on both issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to wishing that Ministers had the answers. However, it is more important that Ministers have the political will to deal with these issues and take on vested interests to resolve them. The first test would be to deal with the question of the ownership of land. I am heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to publish the Goodbody report since his colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, as late as last July refused to publish it and effectively suppressed its findings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must not make a statement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister deal with the report as quickly as possible and publish it rather than waiting until NESC decides to publish its findings? As quickly as possible after that, the Minister should use his political power and will to deal with the proposals contained in the three reports.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is misrepresenting what my colleague and I said. I said the Goodbody report would be published with the NESC report. In regard to the Kenny report, the Deputy and I know that successive Administrations have not been unwilling to deal with the issue, rather there has been a constitutional process which might have proved difficult.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The builders tested Part V. The Minister should allow the constitutionality to be tested.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="726"/>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. We have already dealt with Part V. I hope we will see rapid progress but I do not know when to expect the NESC report. However, the Deputy can take it that there will be no undue delay in publishing it when it becomes available.</P>

    <P>Does the Minister have any basis for stating that the findings of the all-party committee on private property are not fact? He stated that it was a contention that it was not unconstitutional to put the recommendations of the Kenny report into effect. Does he have any basis for that assertion given that I was on the committee at the time when we had the advice of senior counsel and highly respected public servants like T.K. Whitaker and others? To suggest that they were stating anything other than fact would be quite shocking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must be brief since we have exceeded the time for the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister states that further analysis is needed, is that analysis under way and will he inform the House of its results? Will he take a similar approach and take a risk, as was the case in respect of legislation for people with disabilities who came before the courts to test the merits of their case? Why not allow the vested interests &mdash; the owners of the large banks of land &mdash; take the Government to court if they so wish, but let us not wait around and be afraid to act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing my best to observe the protocol of a Minister&rsquo;s first day in office and avoid acrimony with him at this early stage. However, I am disappointed with his reliance on Department-speak in response to a very direct question from me to which I expected a direct answer. Does the Minister intend to do anything to cap the price of building land, given that he has available to him a report of an all-party committee on the Constitution?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that we are fortunate his portfolio is the environment and not foreign affairs? If 31 years cannot solve what he describes as this complex issue, it just as well he is not with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, at his meeting this afternoon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that things were that simple. Almost all the political parties in this House have at some time been in power in the past 31 years and have been fully aware of the Kenny report and the difficulties. It is perhaps easier to prescribe how that can be dealt with from the Opposition benches than it is from Government&rsquo;s. It is not Department-speak. Rather, we are in a pro<Col N="727"/>cess and the reports will be published and a review will take place at that stage. As I stated, I will do my best to expedite the publication of those reports and the follow-up action which comes from them.</P>
    <P>However, it is untrue to suggest that political parties in this House have been unwilling. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment on Part V stated that it found it constitutional on the basis that it was proportionate and non-discriminatory. However, when one examines the language in the Kenny report, it does not have the same degree of certainty. It is not intended to in any way be discourteous to the people who worked on the committee. However, the committee&rsquo;s recommendation is a contention which has not been through any process. We will soon have the NESC report and, as soon as we do, it will be published and we will take the follow-up action.</P>

     <Quest>if he will report on the work undertaken to date by the internal implementation team within his Department dealing with decentralisation; his views on whether State agencies operating under the aegis of his Department may suffer a loss of key expertise if the move goes ahead; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22573/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s decentralisation unit is co-operating actively with the decentralisation implementation group and the Department of Finance in regard to the decentralisation programme announced in the budget for 2004. An implementation plan covering all aspects of the decentralisation process for my Department has been submitted to the group. The Office of Public Works, which has general responsibility for property management in connection with the programme, is liaising with my Department on the Department&rsquo;s four new decentralised locations.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to developing innovative approaches to information management, communications and logistics to maintain and improve the quality of service to be delivered under decentralised arrangements and to minimise disruption. Its decentralisation unit is also facilitating full and timely communication with staff of the Department on the progress of the decentralisation programme through the Department&rsquo;s partnership committee and otherwise.</P>
    <P>Two state agencies under the aegis of my Department are included in the decentralisation programme. The National Building Agency submitted its decentralisation implementation plan to the implementation group on 31 May. As the decision in relation to the new location for the Local Government Computer Services Board was not announced until 8 July, the board is in the process of finalising its decentralisation implementation plan. Each agency is required to put in place skills and knowledge transfer arrangements, such as in-house training and external courses and programmes, to upskill new staff to maintain <Col N="728"/>and improve the quality of service to be delivered under decentralised arrangements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I have studied the figures published by the central applications facility which demonstrate that, for the 661 jobs which are to be decentralised to the four locations, only 38 applicants are from within the Department. Having regard to the Minister&rsquo;s statement about the desirability to minimise disruption in the Department, what assessment has been made in his Department of the likely disruption to the work of the Department if only 38 of the Department&rsquo;s existing staff will be there after decentralisation and more than 600 staff will be reallocated to other Departments? Has the Accounting Officer of the Department carried out a formal risk assessment taking into account the impact of the decentralisation proposal on service to the public and the general work of the Department? How does the Minister propose to minimise disruption, to use his own phrase, if, of the 661 staff, only 38 will move and more than 600 are reallocated to the 14 other Departments of State?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am not in a position to answer the question on risk assessment, I will seek the relevant information for the Deputy and communicate it to him. The four locations intended to benefit from decentralisation, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and New Ross, stand to gain 270, 225, 62 and 127 positions, respectively. There appears to be a discrepancy between the two sets of figures as one adds up to 681, while the other adds up to 661. The latter figure is correct because it refers to the number of staff below principal officer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct that the overall summary of applications has varied. For example, applications have been made for 92% of posts in Wexford, Kilkenny is oversubscribed with 124 applications&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The applications have not been received from within the Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. They are from across the range of Departments. Obviously programmes will have to be put in place, including one to train and retrain staff. This will be done as part of the process. As regards the Local Government Computer Services Board, the process is not complete. While I do not have final figures, it is clear that a considerable amount of training, retraining and redeployment of personnel will be required. This is all part of the decentralisation process.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that we have discussed decentralisation for 40 years. The first occasion on which we had a debate on the issue was 1964 and 40 years later we are still discussing it. If anything indicates the paralysis from which we suffer when we have an idea worth implementing, it is the issue of decentralisation. This is the first Government to put together a programme to deliver it. We all subscribe to the concept of <Col N="729"/>decentralisation, although what we are doing is closer to deconcentration.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to start a debate about the general theory of decentralisation. My question specifically relates to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. How will the Department work efficiently if only 38 of the applicants for the 661 jobs to be decentralised to Kilkenny, New Ross, Waterford and Wexford are from the Department? These positions cover highly specialised areas. I do not understand how someone dealing with pensions in the Defence Forces today will be retrained to deal with complex water and sewerage schemes tomorrow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The theory on which public administration has operated since the 1920s is that we have general service staff who are regarded as broadly transferable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not the 1920s.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has some experience in this matter and will be aware that we have career arrangements in place by which people are promoted and move from one section to another over time. Nobody is suggesting that decentralisation will be anything other than challenging but the challenge will have to be met.</P>

     <asker>Mr. S. Ryan </asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
     <Quest>if he has sought and received assurances from his British counterparts that adequate procedures are in place to prevent the hijacking of an aeroplane in British airspace to crash into the Sellafield plant, in view of the serious consequences of such a development for citizens here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[22590/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the risk posed to Ireland by the potential transboundary effects of an accident or incident, including a terrorist attack by aircraft or otherwise at Sellafield, the security arrangements and procedures established at Sellafield by the United Kingdom authorities have been a particular ongoing concern of the Government. My predecessor repeatedly raised these concerns by direct correspondence and in face to face meetings with my UK ministerial counterparts, as have officials of my Department in meetings with their UK counterparts. The United Kingdom in response has given assurances that it is satisfied <Col N="730"/>with the security arrangements and that these are subject to continuous review.</P>
    <P>In March 2003, my predecessor, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, wrote to the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Ms Patricia Hewitt, MP, regarding concerns about the possibility of terrorist attacks. She furnished a reply on 16 April 2003, which was published as an appendix to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 141 of 14 May 2003. In her reply, the Secretary of State indicated that the UK is satisfied that arrangements for ensuring security in its civil nuclear industry are robust, additional measures put in place since September 2001 to reinforce security are appropriate, and these security arrangements are subject to continual review. In a further exchange of correspondence earlier this year on security related issues at Sellafield, the Secretary of State indicated that the Royal Air Force maintains a high state of readiness in the air defence of the UK, including the defence of particularly sensitive targets and its state of readiness is kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>The assurances and information on nuclear security issues received from the UK authorities are welcome as far as they go. However, our legitimate concerns form a basis to develop an agreed, structured and meaningful system between the UK and Ireland for the exchange of security sensitive information without compromising the security needs and concerns of the UK with regard to such information. This point has been emphasised in exchanges with the UK and I assure the House I will continue to make this point at every opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister elaborate on his use of the phrase &ldquo;as far as they go&rdquo; while referring to the assurances given by the UK authorities? May I assume from it that he does not accept their assurances or believes them to be less than adequate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>What I mean by that phrase is that we have a legitimate concern on this issue which is best addressed by developing a structured and meaningful system of exchange of clear information on it. While I fully understand the reason the administration of another jurisdiction has concerns about making available security sensitive information, it should be possible to provide the structured system of exchanging information we seek without compromising its security needs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we have something to be worried about? The Department has correspondence on this issue which became critical in 2001. If someone crashed an aeroplane into Sellafield, we would all be at risk. It appears the Minister is not happy with the assurances the Department has received. Does the public have cause for serious concern that the security arrangements regarding Sellafield are not adequate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is incorrect. As I have stated clearly, it would be much better if we could have <Col N="731"/>a process for the exchange of information, rather than simply assurances.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that assurances obtained from the British Government, which cannot protect its Parliament or Prime Minister against a flour attack or pro-hunt protesters, are dubious? Does he now agree that the only way to deal with this sensitive issue is at Prime Minister level? Will he urge the Taoiseach to demand from Tony Blair a detailed security report on Sellafield? We do not enjoy the economic benefits of Sellafield but we are exposed to all the risks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

	<P>That is what I meant to say. It is Sellafield that I am worried about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Further to the Minister&rsquo;s reply, will he tell us whether his ongoing concern relates solely to the installation of Sellafield, given the number of shipments to and from it and other installations, including the flotilla making its way across the Atlantic? Is his concern simply based on the political dimension rather than the practicality? Sellafield is referred to so often in the media that it seems to draw attention when in fact other installations, which are of serious concern in their own right, such as Wylfa or Sizewell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we talking about a more comprehensive approach or is the Minister&rsquo;s concern just in response to media agitation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair to suggest it is just in response to media agitation. Both sides of this House use Sellafield as an expression of our concern about a range of facilities.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens to be the one that is very close to us and which is referred to frequently.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the UK authorities have not been disposed over the years to disclosing details of security measures. They have provided assurances. It would be best, from the point of view of <Col N="732"/>the two neighbours, to establish a process whereby we would have more than assurances and be part of an information exchange.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 10 is a very good question. Has the Minister applied his mind to the environmental consequences of a plane being taken from Irish airspace to be crashed into the Sellafield plant, given that we are about 70 miles from Britain and given the proximity of our airspace to the plant? Has the RAF, the British Government or any other body views on this prospect, bearing in mind that a jet airliner can travel at more than 600 mph?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>OCNS, which deals with the issue in the UK, has a general responsibility in this regard, including a responsibility to deal with hazards from aeroplanes irrespective of their origin. However, Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s point is valid. There are many small and medium-sized airstrips not just on this side of the island but on the far side of the Irish Sea that are very close to the Sellafield installation. The Deputy&rsquo;s point illustrates the validity of the concerns that all parties, both in Government and Opposition, have on this issue.</P>

    <P>I want to say a few words on the serious employment crisis in Ballinasloe. The town and the surrounding area have received another severe blow last week with the announcement by Dubarry that it is to lay off 40 more of its workers. This means that the production of shoes by the company will cease. It will retain 40 jobs in Ballinasloe in the distribution and research and development sections, but all manufacturing will take place overseas. It used to employ 200 workers. The recent announcement, coupled with the closure of the Square D factory last year, which resulted in a loss of 450 jobs, and the loss of 350 jobs at the AT Cross factory three years ago, means that Ballinasloe has lost more than 1,000 jobs in three years.</P>
    <P>There is an employment crisis in Ballinasloe and the surrounding area. I call on the new Minister to make the town a top priority for new employment. I acknowledge the work that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, has been doing to try to generate jobs for Ballinasloe and I wish her all the best in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Ballinasloe is a great town on the national primary route between Athlone and Galway. It is known for its great educational facilities, including Garbally College. It has a new secondary school and a new gaelscoil is being built. It has a new marina and new state-of-the-art swimming and leisure facilities. It has two great hotels, one of which is expanding, and planning permission is being sought for two more. The people of the town have set up Ballinasloe area development company and are doing great work in their enterprise centre where approximately 200 people are employed. I acknowledge other small employers who have expanded in the town, thereby providing some real employment. Ballinasloe&rsquo;s hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, is excellent and I compliment the former Minister for Health and Children on supporting it.</P>
    <P>Ballinasloe has much to offer any industrialist who comes to it. It has a 25-acre industrial park in which a new factory is being built. It has the AT Cross factory and the Square D factory, which may be available for purchase, and a workforce that wants to work in the town. I therefore appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to generate employment for us. I invite him to visit Ballinasloe as soon as possible to <Col N="734"/>meet the Dubarry workers who are losing their jobs. I have every confidence in him and wish him well in his new Ministry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Callanan for raising this important issue and for his kind comments on my appointment. The announcement by Dubarry on 23 September that it has decided to transfer the remaining production element of its operations overseas with the loss of 40 jobs is a devastating blow for those who will lose their jobs. I am conscious of the adverse effects that the loss of these jobs will have on the surrounding area, especially considering the closure of the Square D factory in January last year.</P>
    <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S has contacted the company and will make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, job placement, guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs and courses.</P>
    <P>Dubarry&rsquo;s headquarters operation, along with its expanding product development, quality assurance, marketing and design operations, employing up to 40 people, will remain in Ireland. I understand that Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with Dubarry on new product and market development initiatives. The company feels that the outsourcing of the production element will help its overall competitiveness and this, coupled with the fact that it is continuing to invest in new product development and marketing initiatives, will strengthen it and retain the maximum number of jobs in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>On developments in Ballinasloe, I advise the Deputy that the town remains a location of high focus for IDA Ireland for new foreign direct investment. Since the Square D closure announcement in January 2003, there have been 12 visits to Ballinasloe by potential investors. IDA Ireland has acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe and has developed it as a new business and technology park. The agency has co-operated closely with local private developers to construct a 27,000 sq. ft. advanced technology building on the park. The construction of a second advanced technology building is also under way at the park, and completion is expected before mid-2005. In addition, IDA Ireland has provided a site to the ESB for the construction of a power station to satisfy the electricity needs of new projects locating on the park.</P>
    <P>I understand that the ESB is out to tender for the construction of this station.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the park to date is in the region of &euro;2.5 million. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland continue to work actively with their existing base of companies in the county and the Ballinasloe area to encourage them to grow and expand. As part of its strategy, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services. In 2003, the agency approved more than &euro;5 million for development projects for its client <Col N="735"/>companies in County Galway and by August this year had approved almost &euro;4 million in project support. In addition, it is providing support for the appointment of a manager for Ballinasloe enterprise centre as well as supporting a one-year training programme for entrepreneurs in nearby institutes of technology under the enterprise platform programme as part of encouraging high potential start-up companies in the region.</P>
    <P>In the area of telecommunications, Galway County Council and the State development agencies are finalising a proposal for submission to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the development of broadband infrastructure. The provision of this facility will assist in the marketing of the town for new business. The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 110 jobs, mainly from the National Roads Authority, to be relocated to Ballinasloe. This move demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in this area.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies are fully committed to ensuring an equal distribution of job creation opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular, the Border, midlands and west region of which Ballinasloe forms a part. I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, will continue to work closely together and with local interests in promoting Ballinasloe for additional investment and job creation. I will keep in touch with the Deputy on an ongoing basis to make sure that momentum is maintained.</P>

    <sTitle>Dublin Port Tunnel.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Deputies on their recent ministerial appointments and wish them well for the future. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting my request for an Adjournment debate with the Minister for Transport on the major problems in the Dublin Port tunnel. I want to raise serious concerns about what is going on at the port tunnel. I am also voicing the concerns of the people of Fairview, Marino, Drumcondra, Santry and Whitehall. There is a crisis at the moment at the Dublin Port tunnel. I call for an immediate investigation into what is going on. I have been given a detailed report on serious flaws in the design process as well as possible dangers to staff and local residents. This &euro;750 million tunnel is now at risk and there could be a disaster in the area. I challenge the city council and the Minister for Transport to come clean on this serious issue.</P>
    <P>The three crucial points in my complaints are as follows. First, the huge entrance and exits to the tunnel are unstable. Second, water has been seen leaking into the tunnel through openings. Third, experts state that the tunnel has design deficiencies. Parts of the controversial tunnel were cracked and leaking water, according to the consultants&rsquo; report, a copy of which I have in my <Col N="736"/>possession. There have been unresolved design deficiencies and the tunnel entrances and exits are now unusable. A note by health inspectors hired by Dublin City Council to oversee safety on the project has been ignored. The design deficiencies, cracking and the leakage in the tunnel are a time bomb waiting to explode. They should stop immediately and deal with the serious issues.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that public representatives have not been informed on this issue. When I received the leaked document from the offices of the port tunnel, I was shocked and horrified by the information. The project has been beset with major delays. There have been soaring costs and debate about the building design.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the local residents in the area. We now have 173 property residents who have lodged complaints along the route of the Dublin port tunnel. Among the complaints are as follows. There are 112 cracks, 25 hairline cracks, 14 jammed doors and windows, three incidences of damage to roofs, four incidences of damage to plumbing, four incidences of damage to glazing and eleven other serious complaints giving a total of 173 complaints. These are the issues with which I deal every day on the port tunnel. Many other residents have lodged complaints on noise and disruption. I have the list in front of me and there is nothing to smile about regarding this matter. We have 173 complaints registered with Dublin City Council and I have many more.</P>
    <P>I raise these issues because we were told that at the beginning of this project that these issues would not arise and that we were being alarmist. The concerns of the people of Marino, Fairview and Santry have been proved correct. The independent consultants have verified them and supported their views. I challenge the Minister to come clean on this issue and ensure the residents&rsquo; safety as well as the safety of the 400 staff in the tunnel. I hope these issues will be taken on board.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGrath for his kind comment on my appointment. I am delighted with my appointment as it is certainly a challenging task, especially with the infrastructural developments taking place. Today, I am trying to get a handle on my brief. I would be happy to give information to any Member on any project that is under way.</P>
    <P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authority concerned. In the case of the Dublin Port tunnel, it is Dublin City Council. I am glad of the opportunity to inform the House of the good progress that is being made in the construction of the tunnel. Work has been under way on the tunnel since 2001. It is well on its way to completion and is expected to open to traffic towards the end of 2005. When complete, the Dublin Port tunnel will be of major benefit to Dublin city centre and especially to the communities that previously have had to endure high volumes of heavy <Col N="737"/>goods vehicles travelling to the port. I am personally aware of that as it impacts on my own constituency of Dublin North Central.</P>
    <P>The tunnel is part of a major investment programme in transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area. Together with an upgraded M1, a completed M50, Luas and upgraded rail and bus services, it will assist in improving traffic flow around the city. Deputy McGrath raised some serious issues. He asked the Minister to come clean. I assure the Deputy that I have not held back any information. I think Deputy McGrath understands that is the way I operate. I invite the Deputy to make a submission about anything on which he seeks clarity.</P>
    <?oasys _dc24-?><P>The tunnel has been planned and designed and is being constructed to the highest international standards. Safety has been a key objective in the design and construction. It will remain a key objective in the operation of the tunnel. I understand from the NRA that a safety audit of the project confirms that the Dublin port tunnel complies with the requirements of the recently adopted EU directive on safety in road tunnels. I am also informed by the NRA that the operating system for the tunnel and the ventilation and safety systems have been designed with safety as paramount. Measures to deal with accidents, breakdowns and fires in the tunnel are all being installed. Safety features associated with the scheme include emergency telephones, lay-bys, pedestrian and vehicular cross passages, CCTV coverage of the tunnels, a 24-hour manned control room and fire and incident detection equipment to mention just some. These features represent a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of vehicles through the port tunnel and are in line with the best international practice.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Dublin City Council has informed my Department that in ongoing monitoring of the contractor&rsquo;s designs by the construction supervisors appointed by the city council, some concerns regarding the design of floor slabs in the cut and cover tunnel sections were identified. A detailed review of this design issue is ongoing. If remedial measures are called for at any stage, the contractor is required to implement them at their own expense. These measures would be relatively straightforward and uncomplicated to carry out and by their nature would not lead to delays. Some leaks of a very minor nature and within construction tolerances have also occurred at some joints. As backfilling progresses over the segments concerned, the position is rectified. Dublin City Council has informed my Department that, contrary to the impression that may have been created, the tunnels are safe and stable. At no time could or have these minor leaks contributed the remotest possible risk to the health and safety of the workforce or to residents hundreds of metres away.</P>
    <P>The tunnel&rsquo;s construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. This monitoring of both the design and construction processes is how deficiencies, if they arise, are detected and put right. The quality con<Col N="738"/>trol exercised in the port tunnel project is quite clearly effective.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the operational height of the tunnel is that the Minister for Transport will shortly be finalising a review of this matter. This review was commenced by his predecessor. I hope this reply is helpful and informative.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my congratulations and good wishes to the Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern. I wish them well in their portfolios. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Liffey Terrace consists of a small terrace of 11 houses and a public house at one side of St.<?oasys _jy?>Lawrence&rsquo;s Road in Chapelizod. The residences are approximately 90 years old and pre-date the modern sewerage system. This area is part of the Liffey valley and within the bailiwick of Dublin City Council. It is less than a mile from the boundary of the city and Fingal County Council.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the situation now facing the residents of ten of the middle-terraced households. In August of this year, they received correspondence from their local authority giving them two weeks to pay &euro;8,333 each to connect them to the public sewerage system. This threatening letter caused obvious distress and concern to all residents but, in particular, to the elderly pensioners who have lived on the terrace for many years. The ten households have now entered into discussions with Dublin City Council engineers to try to find a cost effective solution to their drainage problem. They fully recognise that they should be connected to the public drainage system. Indeed, it was the residents who brought this matter to the attention of the local authority in the first place.</P>
    <P>The households on Liffey Terrace now share a common drain running to the back of their houses on land which they do not own. The land is owned by another party and the residents have an established right to use the land for drainage.</P>
    <P>The residents propose to upgrade this common drain and provide connection to the public drainage system. Dublin City Council has now given its full support to residents in resolving this matter. I would be grateful if the Minister would give sympathetic consideration to allowing this group of neighbours avail of the group sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>A reading of the explanatory memorandum, GW60, suggests this group of neighbours qualify for assistance under the scheme. There is no proposal to carry out a public scheme to serve these ten houses and it is in an area that can be served by an extension to the existing sewer.</P>
    <P>The residents are looking for assistance to cover part of the cost of providing a functioning common drain to run to the rear of the houses as well as other works associated with the scheme. They are willing to appoint an energetic organiser as well as a committee as outlined under the scheme. They are willing to contribute to the project as well as provide working capital to meet <Col N="739"/>the expenses involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. The residents have started work in compiling a technical report on the best way to resolve this matter at the lowest cost to all. They are collaborating with Dublin City Council engineers.</P>
    <P>Liffey Terrace is unique in the Dublin City Council area. It pre-dates the installation of a public sewerage system and is the last such group of houses in Dublin. In this instance, the application of the group sewerage scheme will not open the State to a flood of claims as it will not create a precedent.</P>
    <P>An application under the scheme should not be ruled out on the basis of geography alone. It would be discriminatory to refuse such an application simply because it is on one side or the other of the boundary between the city and Fingal County Council. The residents are anxious to resolve the problem. They have co-operated with Dublin City Council and they are willing to contribute to making progress. However, they should not face the cost of the work alone. They should be allowed claim the assistance which is available everywhere else in the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened carefully to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the situation in Liffey Terrace. I will outline the operation of the group sewerage scheme grants.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify that these grants are provided under the rural water programme. The Deputy will appreciate that, by its very nature, this programme does not apply to urban areas. The objective of the programme is to assist the provision of services where local authority water and sewerage infrastructure is not available and such services cannot be provided economically. The rural water programme makes grant assistance available to local communities to put such facilities in place on a communal or voluntary basis where they cannot be obtained from a local authority, usually because of remote location or the distance of the households from the nearest public water or sewerage mains. These conditions should not arise in a residential suburb of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, responsibility for the administration of this programme has, in any event, been entirely devolved to county councils since 1997. The Deputy will appreciate that in accordance with the devolution arrangements, all matters relating to the approval and payment of <Col N="740"/>group water and sewerage scheme grants are now matters solely for county councils. Consequently the Minister has no direct function in the decision-making process as it applies to individual cases. Even if this was being pursued by the local authority, there is no proposal of any description before my Department from Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>Against that background, I very much regret that I am unable to be of assistance to the Liffey Terrace residents in the manner envisaged by the Deputy. In the circumstances, any arrangements relating to connections to the public sewer in this case will need to be resolved in ongoing discussions with Dublin City Council. That is where the solution to this problem will have to be found.</P>
    <P>In rural areas where public sewerage connections are not available from a local authority, grants of up to &euro;2,031 per house, or 75% of the cost, whichever is the lesser, may be payable where a group of householders come together to provide a common or shared sewage collection and disposal system. In urban areas it is a matter for individual householders and property owners to connect their premises to the sewers provided by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the argument put forward by the Deputy but it would appear that the prospect of finding a solution would be found in direct discussions with the local authority. If the local authority thought there was any way in which the Department could be of assistance, I am sure it would make a submission under existing programmes. I urge the Deputy to continue discussions and hope she will receive a more reasonable response at local authority level.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Landlords may only seek from tenants the rent or other charges agreed to at the commencement of the letting. Under Part 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which will come into operation later this year, a rent review may only occur once per annum unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation in the interim. It will also be unlawful to seek a rent greater than the open market rate so a rent increase would not be possible if the market trend is stable or downward. In any event, competitiveness in the market should preclude registration costs being passed on.</P>
    <P>The registration fee under Part 7 of the 2004 Act, which came into operation on 1 September 2004, is &euro;70 per tenancy. The net cost can be as low as &euro;10.15 per tenancy per annum because the fee will cover a tenancy for four years and is a tax-allowable letting expense. I do not accept the IPOA contention that it is not possible for landlords to fund the net cost in the context of average rent levels. The single, and potentially multi-annual, registration fee of &euro;70 per tenancy replaces an annual fee per tenancy of &euro;51 that landlords had previously been liable to pay to local authorities. For many landlords, therefore, registration cost may be significantly reduced.</P>

	<P>Planning authorities have been levying development contributions since the introduction of modern planning arrangements in 1964 Act. Development contributions are not a tax but are charged to allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs to public funds of servicing land for private development. Without contributions, the provision of services could not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <?oasys _dc24-?><P>In the Planning and Development Act 2000 new provisions were enacted to introduce transparency into the way in which development contributions are levied.

    <P>Statistics on the payment of development contributions for all types of development contributions are collected by my Department on an annual basis. However, due to the lead-in time between the grant of planning permission for a development and the start of construction it is likely that the full impact of the new development contribution schemes will not be measurable until 2006-07. The statistics collected do not differentiate between different types of development for which contributions have been paid.</P>

	<P>Currently my Department is in correspondence with the European Commission in respect of 65 cases relating to possible breaches of EU environmental legislation in the areas of air, planning and environment policy, nature, noise, radiation protection, waste and water. While the vast majority of issues are resolved without any recourse to the European Court of Justice, at present nine of these are the subject of proceedings in the court in respect of non-compliance, or alleged non-compliance, with EU environmental legislation. This includes one case where the Commission has applied to the court to have a daily fine of &euro;21,600 imposed on Ireland, relating to implementation of the directive on the assessment of the <Col N="744"/>effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as environmental impact assessment or EIA directive. It is not possible to anticipate the decision of the court in this case.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>

	<P>Polystyrene is widely used internationally as protective packaging in the transport of electrical and other goods. While such packaging can be recycled, for example, for insulation purposes, there are limited outlets for it in Ireland. The recycling of polystyrene is further hindered by its high volume to weight ratio and the associated costs of collecting such material.</P>
    <P>Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive, that is, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in Annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging. On foot of these provisions, the introduction of controls on polystyrene protective packaging &mdash; such as that used on electrical goods &mdash; is not under consideration.</P><Col N="745"/>
    <P>The Litter Monitoring Body, which is co-ordinated by my Department, has published two reports to date &mdash; in respect of the years 2002 and 2003 &mdash; which provide valuable statistical data in relation to litter pollution in Ireland. Fast food take-away bags and wrappers, much of which comprise polystyrene, have been identified as the largest litter component in the packaging litter category, which is the third largest category of litter after cigarette and food related litter. In the light of the findings of the first Litter Monitoring Body report published in July 2003, in respect of the year 2002, my predecessor announced the intention to take measures to tackle litter caused by fast food packaging, together with chewing gum and ATM receipts which were also identified as significant elements of litter pollution. To this effect, a consultancy study was commissioned to carry out an analysis and recommend appropriate economic instruments, including environmental levies, that might be implemented to tackle the litter problems caused by these items. Further to the recent completion of the consultancy study, my predecessor announced a public consultation on the consultants&rsquo; report last week.</P>
    <P>In their report, the consultants recommend, in relation to fast food packaging, that a negotiated agreement be concluded between Government and the fast food sector involving the putting in place of litter protocols, action plans, targets etc. It would be my intention to seek a commitment to the phasing out of the use of polystyrene in fast food packaging, in favour of biodegradable materials, as part of any such negotiated agreement. A final decision on the proposed action to deal with fast food packaging will be taken on foot of the conclusion of the public consultation process.</P>

	<P>The Government announced in early July 2004 a new initiative whereby local authorities will meet the long-term housing needs of social welfare rent supplementation recipients. The new arrangements will involve local authorities progressively assuming responsibility over a four year period for accommodating rent supplement recipients who have been assessed as having long-term housing need, excluding asylum-seekers or other non-nationals who do not have leave to remain in the State permanently and persons in receipt of rent supplement as a <Col N="746"/>&ldquo;back to work&rdquo; incentive or of mortgage supplementation.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11-?><P>Under the new rental accommodation scheme local authorities will use a range of measures, including entering into direct contractual arrangements with accommodation providers in the private rental sector, to provide good quality and affordable accommodation for SWA rent supplement recipients who are in need of long-term housing support.</P>
    <P>The new approach will provide a structured, proactive, supply based approach to meet long-term housing need instead of depending on <i>ad hoc</i> rent allowance payments. It will also involve the development of additional accommodation through new-build PPP type projects, which would be financed, developed and operated on a long-term basis by the private sector but made available exclusively for households nominated by local authorities.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>Funding will be provided to local authorities to support the cost of the new scheme through the redirection of resources from the existing social welfare allowance rent supplement scheme. This funding is in addition to moneys already being provided under the local authority housing programmes. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the social housing programmes, with a combined 2004 Exchequer and non-Exchequer provision of &euro;1.884 billion, will be in no way diminished. However, we hope to get better value for the totality of spending as between the local authority provision and the rent supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>I see the new long-term approach as facilitating a more effective response to housing need through better accommodation standards and security for tenants, improved value for money and an increased supply of accommodation.</P>

	<P>During its Presidency of the European Union, Ireland actively sought to progress towards the adoption of these two directives. The two proposed directives comprised a Council directive setting out basic obligations and general principles on the safety of nuclear installations and a Council directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. Taken together the proposals were known as the nuclear safety package.</P>
    <P>In chairing the European Council&rsquo;s Atomic Questions Working Group, Ireland sought to find a sound consensus on the package to facilitate its adoption at the earliest opportunity. While a number of member states, including Ireland, favoured the adoption of these EU directives, a <Col N="747"/>blocking minority were opposed to the principle of a legal instrument. Despite intensive efforts on the part of the Presidency to find unanimous agreement in the group for the adoption of the package in the form of directives, the group was unable to reach a consensus in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Union, at a meeting on 28 June 2004, adopted conclusions on nuclear safety and on the safety of the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. These conclusions reaffirmed the commitment of the Community and its member states to a high level of nuclear safety and to the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. The Council also stated that it would return to this matter in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has now put forward amended proposals for a Council directive laying down basic obligations and general principles on the safety of nuclear installations and for a Council directive on the safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. It is envisaged that these new proposals will be discussed in the atomic questions working group in due course.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste <Col N="748"/>prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive, that is, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in Annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns with regard to the over-packaging of certain goods. Excessive packaging is generated through a combination of poor packaging design, inefficient production or manufacturing processes, and unsustainable consumption patterns, for example, by purchasing excessively packaged products. Taking action to prevent waste being generated in the first place is fundamental to the overriding objective of de-coupling economic growth from growth in waste arisings. However, Ireland is particularly disadvantaged in relation to the prevention and minimisation of packaging in that approximately 75% of the packaging placed on the market here is imported in association with imported goods.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>The principle of producer responsibility requires waste producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. In support of this approach, a producer responsibility initiative already operates in Ireland in relation to packaging waste, underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997. Under the regulations, producers are required to take steps to recover packaging waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste. Repak Limited, established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, is the only such approved compliance scheme. While Repak&rsquo;s primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste rather than packaging minimisation, the fees structure applicable to its members, which is related to the type and amount of packaging placed on the market, reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my predecessor launched an ambitious national waste prevention programme aimed at delivering significant improvements in waste prevention and minimisation across all waste streams, including packaging. This programme is being led by a core prevention team within the EPA which will have the task of developing the programme in consultation with other stakeholders. Funding of &euro;2 million from the environment fund is being provided for the national waste prevention programme in 2004.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 46 together.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the national spatial strategy, NSS, and has put a wide range of measures in place at national, regional and local levels aimed at achieving the strategy&rsquo;s objectives. A significant milestone in the implementation of the strategy was reached earlier this year with the adoption by all regional authorities of regional planning guidelines which will help to structure and inform local planning. For the first time guidelines of this nature have now been put in place throughout the whole country setting the strategic policy agenda which planning authorities must address in their development plans and creating the crucial linkage needed between overall national spatial policy as set out under the NSS and local planning policies.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>I am aware of the views expressed by the president of the Irish Planning Institute. I value and welcome the views of all stakeholders in the planning process but I consider that much has been done in recent years to strengthen and renew spatial planning in Ireland. Recent developments of note supporting the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objectives as set out under the NSS have included the substantial progress now being made on major national development plan capital investment programmes supporting balanced regional development, particularly in the development of key regional and inter-regional road and rail linkages and in other substantial infrastructure projects which will support the role the key gateways and hubs identified in the strategy.</P>
    <P>The mid-term review of the national development plan also signalled strongly the potential for further aligning NDP expenditure with the NSS planning framework, particularly in the environmental infrastructure and regional operational programmes. Gateway implementation frameworks are now in place in Cork and Galway and work on similar is advancing in other areas. The proposals announced earlier this year for substantial investment in new suburban rail services in the Cork area are a significant example of a direct response from the Government to planning policies agreed at regional level to promote the development of a gateway.</P>
    <P>In adopting and publishing the NSS the Government stated that it would take full account <Col N="750"/>of the strategy in moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. The decentralisation programme takes account of the NSS. However, the Government also had to take account of a wide range of other factors in selecting suitable locations for decentralisation. These other factors included the core business and nature of the relevant Department or agency, the location of their customer base, the location of existing decentralised offices, the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region, the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the new jobs involved, the existence of good transport links and the general infrastructure capacity in the locations selected.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11-?><P>In addition to gateways and hubs, the NSS identified the need to strengthen the county town and large town structure and the need for a renewed emphasis on the potential of small towns, villages and rural areas. The strategy envisages that county towns and other medium-sized towns would continue to play important roles as &ldquo;local capitals&rdquo;, developing their enterprise and service functions and continuing to provide opportunities for employment both in the towns themselves, and in related smaller towns, villages and rural areas. The relocation of public service employment to many of these towns will help to underpin the important role which many of them will continue to play into the future. The Government remains fully committed to this decentralisation programme.</P>

	<P>It would be premature to comment in detail on the relevant opinion of the Advocate General, given the further considerations which must be given to this matter by the European Court. However, I intend that the opinion will be carefully assessed and where gaps have been identified in our current control regime these will be urgently rectified. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that this case relates to past activities and, in the interim, substantial advances have been made in the statutory provisions governing waste management in Ireland, and their enforcement. These include the following: the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended by the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001, and the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, along with a range of supporting regulations, have brought the law in relation to waste into line with best European practice; the licensing regime operated by the EPA has also significantly evolved and over 160 waste licences have been issued by the agency to date; the provision of modernised waste infrastructure and services, all fully licensed, is continuing at an accelerated pace; for all existing municipal waste disposal sites operate under EPA waste licences; and the significant national overview of waste management, Taking Stock and Moving Forward &mdash; April 2004 &mdash; demonstrated considerable advances in the provision of waste services between 2001 and 2003: the number of bring banks increased from 1,400 to 1,700, civic amenity sites increased from 46 to 61 and the position regarding licensed landfill capacity also showed improvement.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11-?><P>I regard enforcement as a key element in making further progress. This objective is being advanced in a number of ways. There has been considerable strengthening of enforcement powers and penalties under the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. I have allocated &euro;7 million for the first year of a major five-year campaign of waste enforcement activity with the objective of supporting and enhancing local authority enforcement activity. The Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, has been established and has in turn established a national enforcement network to ensure a consistent standard of enforcement quality and evenness of activity across local authorities. The OEE has recently engaged consultants to conduct a study <Col N="753"/>of unauthorised waste activities, which will include establishing the extent of unauthorised activities, a review of current procedures and the development of guidance on investigation of unauthorised activity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 56 and 60 together.</P>
    <P>Following an examination of the carbon tax proposal, including an extensive public consultation, the Government has concluded that such a tax was not an appropriate policy option for the purpose of achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A carbon tax was one option only in the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels. It was estimated that a carbon tax would have contributed just over 0.5 million tonnes of emissions reductions towards a total reduction requirement of 9.2 million tonnes per annum during the first commitment period under the Protocol 2008-12. Alternative policy options, focusing on non-tax measures in the National Climate Change Strategy, are being examined with a view to achieving the necessary emissions reductions and ensuring compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>Preliminary figures released by the Environmental Protection Agency in July 2004 indicate that emissions in 2003 were 24.7% above 1990 levels, down from approximately 29% in 2002 and <Col N="754"/>31% in 2001. These figures indicate that significant progress is being made towards the target of 13% above 1990 levels. The National Climate Change Strategy will continue to underpin the Government&rsquo;s approach to achieving the further reductions required.</P>

   <?oasys _cl11-?><Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 45 together.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for house completions, with 68,819 units completed, an increase in output of 19.3% on 2002 and an increase of 10.5% in output in the greater Dublin area during the same period. Output continues to remain high in 2004 with 35,957 units completed in the first six months of this year. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe &mdash; 17 houses per 1,000 population &mdash; which is an outstanding achievement.</P>
    <P>While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. Detailed information <Col N="755"/>on house prices are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, are now predicting greater balance in the housing market over the next few years, as increased supply has a restraining effect on house prices. Indicative data available to the Department show that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply in keeping with demand and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner, and we will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary. The investment in the servicing of land has led to a strong stock of land available for residential development.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met. Almost &euro;5.17 billion has been spent in the first four years of the national development plan on social and affordable housing measures, over 7% ahead of the forecast for that period, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to continue to meet the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs. The housing needs of over 13,600 households were met in 2003 compared to almost 8,500 in 1998, which is the highest level of housing provision under the full range of social and affordable housing measures for over 15 years. The total amount of funding available for social and affordable housing measures in 2004 of &euro;1.884 billion is over four times that amount provided in 1997 and represents an increase of 5.4% of the 2003 provision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 34 and 43 together.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the proposed shipment from the United States to France. This shipment arises from an agreement between the US and Russia in regard to the decommissioning of nuclear weapons. I understand that weapons grade plutonium arising from the decommissioning process is being shipped from the US to France for fabrication into MOX nuclear fuel for application in US nuclear reactors. I understand that the shipment which departed the US on the 20 September last is expected to transit only international and French territorial waters at the European end. My officials have sought and received assurances from the United States and France that the shipment will not enter Irish territorial waters. On this basis, the issue of preventing the shipment entering Irish waters does not arise. In addition to the information received from the US and France, the UK Government advised my officials of the dispatch of the two ships from the UK to collect the shipment from the US for transport to France. This communication was on a Government to Government basis and no direct communication took place with British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</P>
    <P>The issue of notification and communication on nuclear shipments between nuclear shipping states and non-nuclear coastal states has been a difficult issue at the IAEA for some years. Coastal states including Ireland argue that given public concern, the risk of an accident, the risk of environmental damage etc. posed by international nuclear shipments it is necessary for those states to be given detailed information regarding such shipments to allow them to assess the risk and take measures in relation to emergency preparedness and response should they consider it appropriate. The shipping states argue that these shipments utilise international waters, conform to the highest standards of safety set by the IAEA and are safe and secure. They also consider that notification and communication obligations would compromise the fundamental right of innocent passage for all high seas shipments enshrined in international law.</P>
    <P>Ireland has participated actively and constructively on this issue annually in the IAEA General Conference. In the 2004 General Conference Ireland again adopted a key role in the drafting <Col N="758"/>of the resolution on transport safety, which addresses the issue of communication on shipments between shipping and coastal states. I am pleased to say that this resolution was ultimately sponsored by Chile, France, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, the UK, the USA, and Turkey. It received widespread support from all of the other member states of the EU as well as numerous other delegations at the conference. It was adopted at the plenary session of the General Conference by consensus on 24 September last. While the issue will continue to prove difficult, I believe this resolution provides a basis on which to address the concerns of coastal states and Ireland with like minded states will continue to pursue these issues at the IAEA and other relevant international fora.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Council Directive 91/676/EEC, commonly known as the nitrates directive, has been implemented in Ireland by way of extensive monitoring of nitrate levels in waters, the assessment of the trophic status of waters, the development and dissemination in 1996 of a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates and a range of other measures which operate to protect water quality from pollution by agricultural sources.</P>
    <P>These other measures include the provision of funding under schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, DAF, such as the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the rural environment protection scheme and the farm waste management scheme to support <Col N="759"/>expenditure by farmers in meeting on measures for pollution control and environmental protection standards. They also include bye-laws made by local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, a wide range of implementation and enforcement actions taken by local authorities under those Acts, the progressive extension of the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the EPA to apply to a wider range of intensive agricultural activities, and the introduction of requirements for compliance with good farming practice in the context of EU-funded direct payments to farmers under agri-assistance schemes administered by DAF. Under the single farm payment scheme, which will replace a number of existing direct payment schemes from January 2005, farmers will be required to comply with a number of EU legislative provisions including the nitrates directive.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>Extensive discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests have taken place since December 2001 as to the further implementation of the nitrates directive. In February 2002, my Department issued an information paper on good agricultural practice and protection of the environment, which set out the background issues and the preferred approach of applying an action programme to all areas rather than to designated vulnerable zones. Consistent with the approach set out in the paper, the European Communities (Protection of Waters Against Pollution from Agricultural Sources) Regulations 2003 identified the whole territory of Ireland as the area to which an action programme will be developed and applied for the purposes of the nitrates directive.</P>
    <P>A draft national action programme for further implementation of the directive was prepared by my Department, jointly with DAF and in consultation with Teagasc, and was issued for consultation on 19 December 2003. Some 70 submissions were received from interested parties and a revised draft was prepared having regard to the submissions received. The revised draft was made available on 9 July 2004 to interested parties in a second round of consultation. An independent adviser was appointed to consider the comments received and to make a report to me with recommendations regarding the provisions of the draft programme.</P>
    <P>I understand some 50 submissions have been received and I hope to receive the report and recommendations of the independent adviser shortly. The draft action programme will then be revised as necessary and submitted to the EU Commission. The action programme will be implemented on a phased basis with effect from 1 January 2005 and will operate for a period of four years.</P>
    <P>The directive requires the application of a general landspreading limit of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum and the action programme must reflect this requirement which is underpinned by recent judgments of the European Court of Justice. However, in accordance with the commitment given in Sustaining Pro<Col N="760"/>gress, an application is being made to the European Commission for approval to apply higher limits &mdash; up to 250 kg per hectare per annum in appropriate circumstances &mdash; in relation to the landspreading of organic nitrogen. The case for this derogation is being developed by DAF and Teagasc in consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive guidance document on the requirements of the action programme is being prepared by DAF and will be distributed to farmers and other stakeholders. This document will explain the requirements of the action programme in detail and provide specific advice on good farming practice in respect of each measure specified in the action programme.</P>

	<P>Road grants provided by my Department for non-national roads include provision for funding footpaths. Urban road authorities receive a special block grant for footpath-carriageway restoration which must be used for restoration works on carriageways and footpaths. A total of &euro;15.087 million has been provided in 2004, an increase of 10.6% on the 2003 allocation. In addition, a total sum of &euro;2.183 million has been allocated to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford City Councils under the regional traffic management scheme in 2004.

    <P>Local authorities may use their own resources, as supplemented by my Department&rsquo;s discretionary improvement and block grants, to fund the provision of footpaths.

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 50 together.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Waste Management Act 1996 sets out comprehensive provisions relating to the recovery of waste, including enabling provision for the making of regulations requiring producers, distributors or retailers of specific products or substances to operate deposit and refund schemes in respect of such products or substances, or of any component of or packaging related to, such products or substances.</P>
    <P>With regard to beverage containers, European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the <Col N="763"/>waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005. Practical implementation of the directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak which is working successfully and in 2001 met the target of 25% packaging waste recycling required by the directive.</P>
    <P>The EPA has reported in its National Waste Database Interim Report for 2002, published in June 2004, that packaging waste recovery increased further to an estimated 33% in that year. Progress has been further facilitated in the interim period arising from the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans, assisted by my Department from the environment fund, and new packaging regulations introduced last year requiring those who place packaging on the market to segregate their back-door packaging waste and have it collected by authorised operators. Bottles and cans sold and consumed in pubs, clubs and hotels are all covered and must now be recycled. The latest indications are that Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets for end 2005.</P>
    <P>Successful deposit and refund schemes operating internationally for beverage containers are generally located in those countries where there has been no break in the continuity and cultural tradition of deposit and refund arrangements. This is not the case in Ireland and there would now quite likely be significant costs involved in re-establishing deposit and refund arrangements here. Account would also have to be taken of the possible impact on existing compliance arrangements. Given that these arrangements are achieving the desired result in relation to meeting the recycling targets, the introduction of deposit and refund schemes for beverage containers is not under consideration.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission published proposals in November 2003 for a directive on batteries, aimed primarily at increased collection and take-back of batteries, and their subsequent environmentally sound treatment and recovery, and the restriction on the use of hazardous substances in such products.</P>
    <P>The use of economic instruments &mdash; including environmental levies, differentiated tax rates and deposit and refund schemes &mdash; to influence increased recovery of batteries by member states are being discussed in the context of the proposed directive. Pending the finalisation of the deliberations on the proposed directive, the introduction of deposit and refund arrangements for batteries is not under consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 61 and 65 together.</P>
    <P>The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, compared with 39,176 households in March 1999. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department&rsquo;s September 2002 quarterly edition of the <i>Housing Statistics Bulletin</i>, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The next statutory assessment of need is due to be undertaken by local authorities in March 2005.</P>
    <P>Local authorities completed-acquired 5,074 units in 2002, 4,972 units in 2003 and completions-acquisitions are envisaged at approximately the same level in 2004. In addition, the voluntary housing sector provided 1,360 units in 2002, 1,617 units in 2003 and is expected to provide 1,800 units in 2004.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of calls to escalate the level of social housing provision, the Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has responded actively to this situation by expanding social and affordable housing output. For example, it is anticipated that total social housing output this year, taking account of new local authority housing vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, will meet the needs of around 13,000 households. This compares with some 7,000 households in 1993.</P>

	<P>Under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2002, up to 20% of land zoned for residential development may be reserved for the needs of social and affordable housing. Planning applications for four or fewer houses or for housing developments on a site of 0.1 hectares or less are exempt from these requirements. These thresholds were set at a level at which it was considered practical to provide social and affordable housing in new housing developments.</P>

	<P>The initial application to my Department from Drogheda Borough Council for assistance towards the provision of a civic amenity centre in Drogheda could not be supported due to issues associated with the proposed procurement process. Following contact with my Department, the draft brief for the centre was modified significantly, and received approval from the Department on 15 April 2004. Consulting engineers have been appointed to the project, and the tender process should commence in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Construction is expected to commence in early 2005 and to take not more than six months.</P>
    <P>While the construction of the centre should be of significant benefit to the people of Drogheda and the surrounding region, I stress that recycling facilities are currently available in the town. A privatised kerbside collection is in operation, and there are ten extensively-used bring sites. Completion of the new centre will enable the people of Drogheda and its environs to improve their rates of recycling and recovery still further.</P>

    <P>Following publication of its interim report in April 2004, the Commission on Electronic Voting has been mandated by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 to continue to assess the secrecy and accuracy of the electronic voting and counting system and to make a further report or reports for this purpose. While the commission has been in contact with my Department in regard to the content of a proposed further report, details of progress in fulfilling its mandate are a matter for the commission.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the continuation of the commission&rsquo;s work, my Department is developing a programme of further testing and validation which is intended to address the concerns raised in the interim report with regard to the secrecy and accuracy of the electronic voting and counting system. The objective of this programme is to demonstrate both to the commission and to the public that the electronic system is suitable to be used at Irish elections. The timing of the further use of the system is dependent on the progress made with this programme of work and the dates on which future polls may be held. As part of the work programme, regard will continue to be had to further experiences internationally in the use of electronic voting and counting solutions and their applicability or otherwise to electoral arrangements in Ireland.</P>

	<P>There are currently seven cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action in relation to non-implementation of EU directives in areas for which my Department has responsibility. This figure includes one case where the Commission applied to the court for a daily fine in relation to the incomplete transposition of the EIA directive. In a further case, the Commission has announced its intention to take legal action. The cases where legal action has been initiated are as follows.</P>
    <P>Dangerous substances in water: This case relates to a directive on water quality. This directive is substantially implemented in the context of the Local Government Water Pollution Act and related legislation. For the purposes of this directive water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances. However, EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. The directive is being further implemented in the context of implementation of the water framework directive.</P>
    <P>The directive on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as environmental impact assessment or EIA: The points at issue relate to one aspect of the implementation of the directive, with specific regard to peat extraction. The Commission applied to the European Court of Justice on 7 July 2003 seeking the application of a daily fine of &euro;21,600 for each day of delay in implementing measures in relation to the environment impact directive. There is ongoing communication with the Commission to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>Two alleged failures to designate areas for conservation: The first case concerns the failure to fulfil obligations under the birds directive and the habitats directive and relates specifically to the effects of sheep overgrazing in the Owenduff and Nephin Beg regions. My Department is in communication with the Commission with a view to <Col N="769"/>satisfying the requirements of the court. The second case relates to the designation of a sufficient number of special areas of conservation under the habitats directive. My Department has worked to meet the requirements of the directive and has to all intents and purposes satisfied the requirements of the court judgment.</P>
    <P>A number of waste issues: The Advocate General delivered his opinion on this case to the European Court of Justice on 23 September 2004. On this matter, I refer to the reply to Question No. 27 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>
    <P>End-of-life vehicles: It is intended to make regulations later this year fully transposing the directive&rsquo;s provisions and facilitating its full implementation in 2005.</P>
    <P>The reporting requirements under an EU regulation on ozone depleting substances: A defence has been lodged in this case.</P>
    <P>On 22 July 2003, the Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to take legal action in relation to the decision by the Government to introduce a &euro;20 charge on citizens wishing to make submissions on development consent procedures. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date. I have no proposal to amend the relevant regulations, which reflect an approach endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 253 together.</P>
    <P>The administration of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes is a matter for individual local authorities. The framework for the operation of the schemes is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities with regard to their administration. It is a matter for the authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within the allocations notified to them for this purpose by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes within these allocations. My Department recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants and it is the responsibility of the authorities to fund their one third contribution from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by the authority without a corresponding revision of the authority&rsquo;s own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</P>
    <P>Capital allocations totalling &euro;65 million for expenditure in 2004 on the disabled persons and essential repairs grants were notified to local authorities on 20 May. They were advised to notify my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements in order to facilitate the reallocation of funds to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Kildare County Council received a capital allocation of &euro;934,000 in May 2004. They subsequently sought an increase of &euro;116,000, which was allocated to them on 9 September, to bring their total allocation for the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2004 to &euro;1,050,000. No further requests for increased funding have been received from the council in respect of these schemes.</P>

	<P>The Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s, EPA, recent state of the environment report, Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2004, concludes that our environment remains of generally good quality and that, while the potential pressures on the environment are growing, the means to combat them are keeping pace through a widening range of laws and policies. Ireland fully supports EU co-ordinated efforts for environmental protection and maintains an intensive programme in relation to the transposition and implementation of EU environmental legislation. Some 200 items of EU environmental legislation, including more than 140 directives, have by now been transposed. The European Commission published its Fifth Annual Survey on the Implementation and Enforcement of Community Environmental Law 2003 in July 2004. The report includes a &ldquo;scoreboard&rdquo; showing the performance of member states under three headings, relating to non-transposition, non-conformity and failure to implement derived or secondary obligations. Of the then 15 member states Ireland was ranked sixth best in relation to transposition, eighth in relation to conformity and 15th in relation to the implementation of derived or secondary obligations. A high priority is being <Col N="772"/>given to addressing the outstanding issues in relation to designations for nature conservation and for prevention of pollution from nitrates, in consultation with relevant stakeholders. My Department, through the local authorities and the EPA, continues to work towards maintaining a high level of environmental protection for Ireland. To strengthen implementation structures, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, has been recently established. In addition to a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities, the OEE exercises a supervisory role in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities.</P>

	<P>The administration of the disabled persons grant scheme is a matter for individual local authorities. The framework for the operation of the scheme is already laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in the operation of the scheme. My Department recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants and it is the responsibility of the authorities to fund their one third contribution from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Capital allocations totalling &euro;65 million for expenditure on disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2004 were notified to local authorities on 20 May last. Authorities were advised to notify my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements, in order to facilitate the reallocation of funds to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Additional allocations totalling some &euro;5.9 million were made to a number of local authorities on 9 September on foot of requests for increased allocations received from the authorities involved. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by the authority without a corresponding revision of the authority&rsquo;s own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</P>
    <P>The improvements which have been made in recent years to the amount of the disabled persons grant, and the level of recoupment available, <Col N="773"/>have resulted in a significant increase in levels of demand, with expenditure on the scheme increasing from &euro;13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to &euro;50 million for 5,739 grants in 2003. In line with this very significant increase in my Department&rsquo;s capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased from &euro;6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost &euro;37.5 million for 6,153 grants in 2003. In that time the maximum grant has doubled from &euro;10,158 to &euro;20,320. These very significant increases in the levels of funding provided are clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the disabled persons grant scheme.</P>

	<P>The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/91/EC was adopted on 16 December 2002. Member states must legally transpose the directive by 4 January 2006. However, the directive provides for a longer period, up to 4 January 2009, for implementing provisions regarding the energy performance certification of newly constructed buildings and existing buildings, when these are let or sold; improvement of the energy efficiency of larger boilers; and inspection of air conditioning systems A working group has been established to oversee and plan the implementation of this directive in Ireland. The working group comprises senior officials from my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
    <P>The energy performance of buildings directive requires that national energy performance standards must be based on a framework methodology laid down in the directive but does not mandate specific thermal performance or insulation standards. However, it is anticipated that where a building is sold or let with a certificate incorporating a low energy performance rating, this may adversely affect the marketability of the property, depending on overall market conditions.</P>
    <P>Part L of the national building regulations deals with the conservation of fuel and energy. To assist in meeting obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, Part L and the related Technical Guidance Document L were amended in June 2002. The amended Part L regime sets significantly higher insulation and thermal performance standards for new dwellings, with effect from 1 January 2003. The regulations also apply to the replacement of external doors, windows and rooflights &mdash; roof windows &mdash; in existing dwellings, with effect from 1 July 2003.</P><Col N="774"/>
    <P>My Department has also recently published &mdash; 21 July 2004 &mdash; a consultation document on further proposed amendments to Part L and Technical Guidance Document L for higher thermal performance and insulation standards for non-residential buildings, including factories, offices and shops, with a view to amending the regulations by the end of the year.</P>

    <P>The review, which was carried out in consultation with elected members, sectoral representatives and officials, focused on establishing examples of best practice in the operation of SPCs with a view to transferring such practice to all city/county councils.

In particular, the review identified the key roles of both the SPC chair in terms of leadership of the committee and the director of services in the provision of appropriate administrative support. The recommendations have been endorsed by me and are now to be implemented by local authorities, in accordance with amended guidelines issued to them, on the operation of the new SPCs established following the recent local elections.</P>

	<P>My Department has no role in monitoring the quality of performance of builders and building companies in the area of house repairs and renovations. These matters are primarily the subject of the contractual relationship between the parties to the contract. People who are aggrieved by the quality of work done can obtain redress in the courts. In the case of small claims there is the Small Claims Court which caters for claims up to the value of &euro;1,270. The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 may be relevant in this situation as it provides for implied undertakings as to the quality of a service supplied.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The independent review of our export control system was published in July. The review proposes a number of areas in which the Irish export licensing system can be modernised and strengthened. These include the introduction of new primary legislation to govern Irish military exports, and the filling of a number of gaps in the Irish regime as well as enhanced co-operation between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other agencies with a role in the area, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Customs and Excise. Better use of new technology is proposed that would include the introduction of web-based export licence applications.</P>
    <P>Greater preventative enforcement can be achieved through information provision to all actual and potential exporters about the requirements of export licences, particularly in the case of dual-use goods where exporters might be unaware of their obligations. It is proposed that relevant exporters have good in-company compliance procedures rather than detailed item auditing by the authorities. The publication of an annual report on export licensing activity is recommended, including an aggregate value of military exports, with this annual report laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the constructive proposals contained in the report. Consideration and implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations is being addressed within the framework of an inter-agency group, chaired by Forf&aacute;s, involving the Departments of Enterprise Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Defence and <Col N="781"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform, together with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The scheduling of a parliamentary debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas is a matter for the Whip&rsquo;s office to agree with the Government in regard to the scheduling of Government time in the Oireachtas, and is not a matter for the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment to decide.</P>

	<P>Irish dairy products are currently exported to Russia on the basis of a veterinary-public health certificate which was agreed bilaterally between Ireland and the Russian Federation in 1997. This certificate will continue to be valid until 1 January 2005, at which point it will be replaced by a newly agreed EU certificate covering the export of dairy products from all EU member states to Russia.</P>
    <P>The new EU dairy certificate is one of 14 certificates for trade in live animals and animal products which, following intensive negotiations, were agreed between the EU Commission and the Russian Federation on 2 September 2004. The Russian Federation initially imposed a deadline of 1 June 2004 for acceptance of their proposed import veterinary certification, however, following negotiations, this deadline was subsequently extended to 30 September 2004. Agreement was also reached on the acceptance of the existing bilaterally agreed certificates until the end of this year, thus averting the cessation of trade from 1 October 2004.</P>
    <P>The new certificate for milk product exports to Russia gives rise to certain practical difficulties for Ireland, in so far as it contains a requirement that milk does not come from herds in which there was TB and brucellosis in the previous 12 months. The EU Commission was made aware of the difficulties for Ireland in regard to the dairy certificate during the negotiations and sought unsuccessfully to have the finally agreed certificate amended to alleviate our concerns. Given the importance of overall trade between the EU and the Russian Federation across a wide range of animal products, including beef, the EU Commission was anxious to conclude an agreement within the timeframe imposed by the Russian Federation. Furthermore, it could not countenance any further disruption to trade involving <Col N="786"/>over &euro;1 billion in animal product exports from the EU to Russia.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has stated that the possibility exists to have an ongoing debate with Russia regarding the certificates and it is my intention to continue to seek the best possible outcome for our export trade.</P>

	<P>The person named began his REPS contract on 1 January 2000, and as a result he was subject to the arrangements governing the transition between the first rural environment protection scheme and the second one. These required him to give a written undertaking to complete the measures specified in his REPS plan over a five year period, and to integrate and adapt that plan for the new scheme when it came into operation; or else to give back any payments he had received.</P>
    <P>The new REP scheme came into operation on 27 November 2000, but the person concerned never adapted and integrated his plan as he had undertaken to do. Consequently, my Department must recoup the REPS payments that he had received.</P>

	<P>Tax relief is available under the heading of health expenses, on certain qualifying dental expenses as set out below. Qualifying expenses include those in respect of orthodontic treatment. However, the relief is only available against tax which is actually paid in the State and only to the extent that tax has been paid. For example, if a person makes a claim for relief for net health expenses of &euro;800 but has only paid &euro;400 in tax in the year to which the claim relates, then the extent of the tax relief in respect of the claim can be no more than &euro;400.</P>
    <P>In addition, the person must bear the first &euro;125 of expenses in any one year himself or herself or the first &euro;250 if claiming relief in respect of two or more persons.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the legislation &mdash; section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &mdash; relief may be claimed in respect of treatment obtained outside the State provided the practitioner who carried out the treatment is entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practise medicine or dentistry there.</P>
    <P>The relief may be claimed by an individual in respect of expenditure incurred on his or her own behalf or on behalf of his or her dependants. The relief is granted at the highest rate of tax at which the taxpayer is chargeable for the year of the claim.</P><Col N="788"/>
    <P>To claim tax relief in respect of dental work the individual should submit to his or her tax office a completed health expenses claim form, known as Form Med 1, this is to be completed by the individual making the tax claim. In addition, a completed Form Med 2 is to be completed by the dentist who carried out the dental work.</P>
    <P>As with all health expenses claims, tax relief cannot be claimed in respect of any expenditure which has been or will be reimbursed to the individual or where a compensation payment has been or will be made in respect of such expenditure.</P>
    <P>Routine dental care does not qualify for tax relief, that is, tax relief is not available for the cost of scaling, extraction and filling of teeth and the provision and repair of artificial teeth and dentures.</P>

     <Quest>the reason for the removal of the rollover tax for compulsory land purchase for such areas as new road structures and so on, in view of the fact that his system was removed in the 2002 budget based on the difficult financial outlook; his views on whether a person who is forced to give up property for the overall good under the compulsory purchase structure should have the right to replace that property without paying unjustified tax; if the rollover will be reinstated in the 2005 budget and Finance Bill as an issue of fairness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital gains tax, CGT, is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT now applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order, CPO.</P>
    <P>It was announced in the 2003 budget that no rollover relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement.</P>
    <P>The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the <Col N="790"/>tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. In budget 1998, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought CGT into line with other areas.</P>
    <P>In view of overall taxation policy, there are no plans to change the methods by which CGT is calculated on land that has been compulsorily purchased. Accordingly, there are no plans to reintroduce rollover relief.</P>

     <QRef>[23101/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy in this question may be referring to either of the following situations. The first situation is where an inheritance is given by a parent to a son or daughter with a direction in the parent&rsquo;s will that the inheritance be taken free of inheritance tax. In that situation, the capital acquisitions tax legislation provides that the amount of the tax on the inheritance is treated as an additional inheritance taken by the son or daughter. This equalises the position as between beneficiaries who pay tax themselves and those for whom the estate pays the tax.</P>
    <P>The second situation is where children inherit property from a parent, but where some of them gift their share to their brother or sister. The amount that can currently be taken tax-free by a person from a parent is &euro;456,438. In the case outlined, the brother-sister is treated as having received a gift of the property transferred to him or her from his-her sibling and is liable to gift tax on that property. This is in addition to the inheritance tax due in respect of that person&rsquo;s direct inheritance. The amount that can currently be taken tax-free by a person from a sibling is &euro;45,644. If the Deputy is referring to some other situation, perhaps he would consider providing more details.</P>

The requirements and conditions governing the scheme are set out in statutory instrument No. 353 of 1994.

    <P>An interdepartmental review group was established to review the disabled drivers&rsquo; and disabled passengers&rsquo; tax concessions scheme.

	<P>The plan to introduce an identity card in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a long-term pro<Col N="792"/>ject that is expected to take a number of years to put in place. If, as we hope, the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland are restored at an early date, then the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has stated that it would be for the administration there to decide what use it makes of the identity cards.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11-?><P>In the period since the Deputy&rsquo;s last question on this matter in May 2004, the Home Affairs Select Committee at Westminster has finalised and published its report on identity cards. Although the select committee welcomes the introduction of a national identity card in principle, the report also highlights a number of concerns regarding the specifics, or lack thereof, in a number of key areas that must be addressed as the proposal moves forward. The question of nationality on the card, with respect to persons in Northern Ireland, is one of a number of issues yet to be finalised at this early stage.</P>
    <P>The British Home Office, which is primarily responsible for the implementation of this plan, has demonstrated a willingness to undertake wide consultation and debate on the proposals. In this regard, the Government will continue to consult the British authorities, as appropriate, and monitor developments to ensure that the concerns of Irish citizens are fully taken into account.</P>

In supporting this resolution, Ireland, in common with its EU partners, was reiterating its consistently held position on the separation barrier. The appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal and contrary to international law. The restrictions associated with the separation barrier are having a detrimental effect on Palestinian society. Equally, we are concerned that the route marked out for the barrier could prejudge future negotiations and undermine physically the implementation of the two state solution. We have consistently called on Israel to stop and reverse the construction of the barrier. The Government&rsquo;s position on the barrier was reiterated in the UN General Assembly address this day last week.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 112 together.</P>
    <P>I am aware of reports that Dr. Jiang Yanyong disappeared on 1 June 2004, just before the fifteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre on 4 June. Dr. Jiang had, in March 2003, revealed the real extent of the SARS epidemic crisis in China. It is reported that prior to his disappearance this year, Dr. Jiang had written a letter to the Chinese leadership denouncing the Tiananmen Square massacres and calling for the rehabilitation of the 1989 pro-democracy movement. I understand from subsequent reports that Dr. Jiang was released after seven weeks detention on 20 July last, and is reported to be in good health.</P>
    <P>The Government takes the issue of respect for human rights very seriously, and regularly, and on an ongoing basis, raises human rights with the Chinese Government. The Taoiseach raised the issue of human rights with the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, during his visit to Ireland in May 2004. During his discussions, he outlined Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Both sides agreed on the importance of co-operation and dialogue in working together to bring about respect for international obligations. In his capacity as President of the EU Council, my predecessor also raised human rights concerns during the EU Foreign Ministers troika meeting with China in Kildare on 19 April 2004.</P>
    <P>The EU also discusses key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which is held twice a year. During these meetings, individual and specific cases of concern are raised with the Chinese authorities. The most recent round of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place on 24 September 2004. On that occasion, the EU raised concerns over a number of persons who were arrested both on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and during the massacre in 1989. During the Irish Presidency and in conjunction with our EU partners, we organised the first EU-China seminar on the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which took place in Beijing on 30 June and 1 July last. The purpose of the seminar was to provide technical assistance to China in preparation for their ratification of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department, both in Dublin and Beijing, will continue to monitor the human rights situation in China on an ongoing basis, and <Col N="794"/>we will continue to raise the matter in our contacts with China.</P>

     <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s position on the need for a review of the UN&rsquo;s conduct in relation to the Act of Free Choice 1968-69 in West Papua.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23170/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As my predecessor has stated on many occasions, the question of a review of the Act of Free<?oasys _jy?>Choice in Papua would require the support of UN member states. Inquiries made by our permanent representative to the UN confirm that, at present, there is no significant support for such an initiative. The most productive approach to dealing with the situation of the people of Papua is therefore through contact with the Government of Indonesia. There is, moreover, a possibility that pursuing the issue of the Act of Free Choice would prejudice ongoing efforts to develop a meaningful dialogue with the Government in Jakarta, and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the Papuan people.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging Indonesia&rsquo;s legitimate concern to preserve its territorial integrity, we continue to encourage the Government of Indonesia to strengthen its efforts to address the legitimate aspirations of the people of Papua. In this regard, I welcome the commitment expressed by President elect Yudhoyono of Indonesia to implement the special autonomy law for Papua. This law dates from November 2001 but has not yet been implemented. It provides for a greater degree of autonomy for Papua than for Indonesia&rsquo;s other provinces.</P>
    <P>At my predecessor&rsquo;s request, he met my Indonesian counterpart, Mr. Noor Hassan Wirajuda, in the margins of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2004. My predecessor used the occasion to express Ireland&rsquo;s continuing concerns about the situation in Papua. These concerns had previously been raised with Minister Wirajuda when my predecessor met him in April 2004, during an EU troika meeting, and again in January 2003, in the margins of the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting. Minister Wirajuda took note of our concerns and expressed his belief that the special autonomy law will satisfy the aspirations of the overwhelming majority of the people in Papua. He said autonomy remains the settled policy of the Government of Indonesia and that the strengthened democracy in Indonesia, following successful presidential and legislative elections, would increase autonomy. My predecessor made it clear that we would be carefully monitoring the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Inquiries were also made at that meeting as to the status of the proposal to divide Papua into three provinces. A discussion of Indonesia is planned for the October meeting of the EU External Relations Council. Officials of my Department regularly discuss the situation in <Col N="795"/>Papua with their counterparts from Indonesia, representatives of various Papuan NGOs, as well as from third countries, such as Australia and the United States.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with its EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened partnership and effective dialogue between the EU and Indonesia. As I have said, the Government sees this as the most effective framework at this time for addressing our concerns about the situation in Papua.</P>

	<P>The hunger strike to which the Deputy refers began on 10 August and came to an end on 2 September. No representations were made by the Government to the Israeli authorities during the course of the hunger strike. The Israeli authorities took a very public stance that they would not make concessions to the hunger strikers in any circumstances. The hunger strike ended before there was any loss of life or serious health risk to the hunger strikers. My understanding is that, despite the Israeli Government&rsquo;s statement that it would not make concessions, it will nonetheless be reviewing the conditions of detention in its prisons with a view to determining whether all existing practices are necessary for security.</P>

     <Quest>if the Government complies with the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s most recent request to provide information necessary for a report on the implementation of Resolution 58/7 on the necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s position on the US embargo has been made clear over the years including in answers to parliamentary questions. This position has been reflected in our voting pattern, and that of our EU partners, in the UN General Assembly most recently on 4 November 2003. On that date, the General Assembly approved Resolution 58/7 on the &ldquo;necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main effect of Resolution 58/7 is to reiterate the General Assembly&rsquo;s call upon all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures such as the Helms-Burton Act of 1996. The resolution further urges states that have and <Col N="796"/>continue to apply such laws and measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Each year, in accordance with the terms of the resolution, it is customary for the UN Secretary General to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution. In line with this, on 19 April 2004, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, invited all UN member states to &ldquo;provide any relevant information&rdquo; by 16 June 2004.</P>
    <P>Since the Government has never promulgated or applied laws or measures such as the Helms-Burton Act, it has not been customary to make a submission to the UN Secretary General on this matter. During Ireland&rsquo;s recent EU Presidency, however, we conveyed an EU submission in reply to the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s request, which included the following:</P>
    <P> The European Union believes that United States trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a bilateral issue. Nevertheless, the European Union and its member states have clearly expressed their opposition to the extraterritorial extension of the United States embargo, such as that contained in the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996.</P>

     <Quest>if he will report on Government representations made to the military regime in Burma since the establishment of diplomatic relations on 13 February 2004.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has pursued a strong and consistent line in support of democracy in Burma. Both Ireland, and its EU partners, remain strongly critical of the continued detention under house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the absence of political progress, serious and persistent human rights abuses and the lack of fundamental freedoms in Burma.</P>
    <P>The issue of Burma is raised in all our bilateral political contacts at all levels with relevant third countries. As recently as last week, my predecessor took the opportunity of meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Singapore and Indonesia to encourage them to continue to press the Burmese authorities to move towards greater democracy and to release Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
    <P>During our EU Presidency, the Government ensured that the issue of Burma was regularly discussed in consultations with third countries. Burma was included in the agenda for the EU Ministerial Troika to India on 16 February, and was discussed during the troikas at political director level with China on 26 February and Japan on 27 February.</P>
    <P>The EU&rsquo;s concerns about Burma also featured throughout discussions at the ASEM Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting &mdash; ASEM FMM &mdash; which my predecessor hosted in Kildare in April 2004 as well as at the preceding informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers held at Tullamore, and at meet<Col N="797"/>ings of the External Relations Council in April, May and June. It was also discussed with Premier Wen of China, when he visited Ireland in May.</P>
    <P>Following the ASEM Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting, we continued to work with Burma&rsquo;s Asian neighbours to encourage them to bring their influence to bear on Rangoon. A former senior ambassador, Mr. John Campbell, was appointed as special envoy to the region. He travelled to the region in May 2004, and conveyed the EU&rsquo;s serious concerns about the situation in Burma to our Asian partners.</P>
    <P>It is very much to be regretted that the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other positive developments which were widely expected to take place in Burma earlier this year were not forthcoming. The decision to establish diplomatic relations was taken in the context of increased engagement leading to anticipated progress. Given the lack of such progress, the exchange of ambassadors between Ireland and Burma has been put on hold.</P>

	<P>Permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly, or land in, the State is granted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. Permission is normally granted on condition that the foreign military aircraft is unarmed, and not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives. It is not the practice of the Government to release details of an individual country&rsquo;s landings and overflights. Queries concerning civilian aircraft, including those in the employ of foreign governments, are a matter for the Minister of Transport.</P>

The Government has, on many occasions, expressed its grave disquiet at the impact of actions taken by the Israeli Government on the human rights of Palestinians. The European Union has also regularly conveyed its concerns to the Israeli authorities at the human rights implications of its security policies. Together with our partners in the Union, we will continue to press the Israeli Government to respect fully its obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fourth Geneva Convention, and under Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Most recently, on 22 September, the Quartet called upon the Government of Israel to take all possible steps now, consistent with Israel&rsquo;s legitimate security needs, to ease the humanitarian and economic plight of the Palestinian people.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The review of the code of conduct on arms exports, which was initiated during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, is taking account of developments since the code entered into force in 1998. In this respect, a number of proposals to strengthen and update it are being considered, including a proposal to reinforce the status of the code by transforming it into an EU common position, which would be legally binding. Ireland is supportive of such a reinforcement of the code. We believe that this, the first review of the code of conduct, is a very necessary and important undertaking for the EU.</P>
    <P>Representatives from several EU member states, including Ireland, met with a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, last May to discuss and to exchange views on the ongoing review of the code. Ireland also circulated to our EU partners for consideration suggestions made by NGOs for possible improvements to the code.</P>
    <P>The Netherlands has made the review of the code of conduct one of its priorities for its Presidency of the EU and in that context discussion continues in the forum of COARM, under Dutch chairmanship. The Netherlands, in association with NGO representatives, will be hosting an international conference in The Hague later this month to further consider the ongoing review of the code. Ireland will continue to participate actively in discussions on this matter at working group level within the EU.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that at a meeting held in Dublin on 6 March 2004, the European Burma Network adopted six objectives with regard to the EU&rsquo;s common position, which was due for renewal in April 2004.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its EU partners are broadly supportive of the six objectives. The Deputy will be aware of the three conditions adopted at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Tullamore: the release and continued liberty of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi; the participation of the National League for Democracy and other opposition groups in the National Convention; and the operation of the National Convention free from interference.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be further aware that the EU is presently considering the strengthening of its common position on Burma, given the lack of progress there. Among the measures being considered is the expansion of the visa ban list and a prohibition on EU registered companies from financing loans to named Burmese state-owned enterprises. It is also intended that the EU will <Col N="800"/>vote against the extension of loans to Burma by international financial institutions. The Commission is to put forward means of addressing the issue of illegal logging. At the same time, we have agreed that the Union will increase its assistance to the Burmese people in the areas of health and education as defined in consultation with democratic groups, including the NLD, and managed through the UN system or NGOs. It is hoped that this revised common position will be ready for adoption at the October meeting of the External Relations Council.</P>
    <P>Our continuing goals remain the release and restoration of liberty to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations, and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the principle of having legally binding international agreements on the control of arms exports, with as wide a participation as possible. This is particularly important with respect to small arms and light weapons.</P>
    <P>The export of arms from EU countries must conform to the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control such exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this code which lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods, including small arms. These include respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. A review of the code of conduct was initiated during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU to take account of developments since the code entered into force in 1998 and in this respect a number of proposals to strengthen and update it are being considered.</P>
    <P>A welcome aspect of the proposed international arms trade treaty, which has been put forward by a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, is that the treaty has the objective of setting out states&rsquo; existing international legal obligations in the area of international transfers of arms. In addition, once ratified, the proposed treaty would enable the international community to move forward incrementally, by means of subsequent more specific instruments, to strengthen international controls on arms transfers.</P>
    <P>While work on the drafting of the text of the proposed treaty is still ongoing, it is a promising initiative and I commend the NGOs concerned for their efforts. An official of my Department participated in a conference held last November <Col N="801"/>at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine the text of the proposed treaty. I understand that the text is currently being re-examined from a legal perspective by those NGOs involved in the Arms Control Campaign which met last February in Costa Rica and that as a consequence of those discussions revisions to the text may be made.</P>
    <P>An official from my Department also attended an international workshop on Enhancing the International Export Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons &mdash; the Case for an International Arms Trade Treaty, which took place in Helsinki last June. There was broad representation at the workshop, both from governments and from NGOs. Ireland will continue to be associated with the process and will closely monitor developments.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the higher diploma in education is a compulsory requirement for the registration of teachers in secondary schools. Since its establishment, the diploma has been provided by the four constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin. The diploma is a postgraduate qualification taken by students who hold a primary degree in a subject which is taught at post-primary level. It is provided by the education department of the universities.</P>
    <P>A major change occurred in 1998, which impacted upon the higher diploma in education, when the Higher Diploma in Education, National University of Ireland, Applications Centre, known as the HDEAC, was established. The HDEAC centrally accepts and processes applications to the four constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland for the higher diploma in education, namely, National University of Ireland, Cork; National University of Ireland, Dublin; National University of Ireland, Galway; and National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Previously, graduates interested in studying for the <Col N="803"/>higher diploma in education applied directly to the university of their choice.</P>
    <P>The HDEAC is agent for, and acts on behalf of, the universities participating in the application system and the application regulations, procedures and timetable are agreed annually by these universities. Applicants are awarded points on the basis of performance in their primary degree, any additional relevant academic qualifications and teaching experience. Applications are made to the HDEAC through one common application form. In the case of Trinity College applicants continue to apply directly to the university and I understand that places on the higher diploma in education course are awarded on the basis of academic qualifications and the results of a competitive interview process.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the HDEAC and the Trinity College procedures are working satisfactorily and I have no plans to change them at this stage.</P>
    <P>The content, coverage and methods of delivery of the diploma vary across the four NUI colleges and Trinity College. I am aware that the education departments of the four NUI colleges and Trinity College review their diplomas on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of students and the education sector. Officials from my Department maintain contact with the various education departments in relation to the diploma and other post-graduate qualifications for teachers at primary and second levels and I will ensure that this process continues.</P>
    <P>I am, however, satisfied that the higher diploma in education in the four NUI colleges and Trinity College are currently meeting the needs of students and the education sector. Therefore, I do not have any plans at this stage in regard to the diploma.</P>

	<P>The Sea <Col N="808"/>Fisheries Amendment Act 2003 requires that a fishing vessel must be in a safe and seaworthy condition before a fishing licence can be issued. To facilitate the implementation of this Act my Department published a new code of practice for fishing vessels of less than 15 metres in overall length earlier this year. This code set minimum standards of safety for the vessel to protect all persons on board. It covers vessel design, construction, machinery, safety equipment and stability issues.</P>
    <P>A panel of surveyors has also been established by the Department to ensure that fishing vessels comply with the requirements of the code. To obtain a fishing vessel licence a declaration must be signed by one of the surveyors on the panel signifying that the vessel is compliant with the code. This declaration remains valid for four years subject to the owner&rsquo;s bi-annual declaration.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the code the Department undertook an extensive consultation process with fishing industry representatives and BIM. The draft code was also placed on my Department&rsquo;s website for comment by other bodies and individuals and, since its introduction, officials of my Department have continued to meet with industry representatives and BIM to address their particular concerns.</P>
    <P>The cost of vessel surveys are not laid down by my Department. These costs are subject to market forces and competition. However, grant aid is available towards the costs of safety equipment required under the code as part of a scheme administered by BIM under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In promoting the application of the new code of practice my overall concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waters. Compliance with this new safety regime is the best way to ensure the safety of fishing vessels and their crew.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Sports Council, which is the statutory body charged with responsibility for the promotion and development of sport in Ireland, is directly responsible with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the relevant national governing bodies of sport, in all matters relating to the preparation and participation of Irish competitors at the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>My Department has already been in contact with the Irish Sports Council in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s performance at Athens. The council has advised that a review of Team Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this year&rsquo;s Olympic and Paralympic Games is currently being undertaken &mdash; Athens Review. The review involves questionnaires, one-to-one meetings with the athletes, support personnel, coaches and performance directors. I have been assured by the council that the matters raised by the Deputy will be addressed in the context of the review.</P>
    <P>The aim of the review is to produce an objective assessment of the preparation and performance of the Irish teams at the Athens Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2004, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of all aspects of the programmes throughout the four-year cycle, with a view to making recommendations regarding the development of a programme for Beijing in 2008.</P>
    <P>Wharton Consulting, a leading consultancy firm based in Britain, is conducting the review under the direction of the Sports Council. Wharton Consulting was selected by the Sports Council following a public tender process and has considerable experience working with sporting organisations in England, including Sport England. The review is due for completion by 1 December 2004 and it is the intention of the Irish Sports Council to publish the report in due course.</P>

Under the terms of the agreement the IRFU and FAI have agreed to enter into a joint venture together to procure the development of a 50,000 capacity all-seated stadium at Lansdowne Road, which is expected to be completed by December 2008. Funding will be provided by the Exchequer, the IRFU and the FAI on an agreed shared basis.

This database outlines the specialised health services currently used or needed by people with intellectual disability and informs the strategic direction of these services through the provision of information on trends in service need, service use and wider societal changes that may impact on service developments. The National Intellectual Disability Database answers four key questions: how many people with intellectual disability are receiving specialised health services; how many people with intellectual disability are waiting for such services; what services are they waiting on; and when, in the next five years, do they need these services?

	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to increase the treatment capacity of orthodontic services in the Mid-Western Health Board, MWHB, area and on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including <Col N="815"/>the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region &mdash; including the MWHB &mdash; under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the national treatment purchase fund to health boards-authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The MWHB was allocated an additional &euro;0.451 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
    <P>The management of orthodontic services in the MWHB area is the statutory responsibility of the chief executive officer. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer to supply the information requested regarding waiting times at Nenagh and Limerick to the Deputy directly.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, there were 21,033 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated.</P>

	<P>The number of smear tests carried out annually is approximately 230,000 and represents an increase of almost 20% in recent years. In order to meet this increased demand, additional cumulative funding of &euro;11 million has been provided by my Department since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel, to purchase new equipment and to introduce new technology and thereby increase the volume of activity. In addition, a number of hospitals have undertaken initiatives such as contracting out of smear test analysis to external laboratories. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in waiting times.</P>

	<P>In July 2002 I announced an additional 850 community nursing unit beds which will provide respite, convalescence, long stay and rehabilitation services to elderly patients under two pilot public private partnership, PPP, projects in 17 locations throughout the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and Southern Health Board, SHB, areas.</P>
    <P>Public sector benchmarks for both projects have been prepared and finalised by the ERHA and the SHB. These are a comprehensive and detailed risk adjusted costing of the project elements using conventional procurement over the whole life of the project. The public sector benchmarks have been submitted to the Department of Finance for consideration and my Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with regard to the projects. On approval contract notices will be advertised by each of the awarding authorities in the Official Journal of the European Union.</P>

    <P>The statistical data sought by the Deputy is summarised in the following table. With the exception of data on liver transplants, which comes from the national organ procurement service and renal and pancreatic transplant centre based at Beaumont Hospital, the data presented below are derived from the hospital in-patient inquiry, HIPE, system, which records information on each in-patient and day-case discharge from all publicly funded acute hospitals. Persons hospitalised more than once in a given year for the same condition are counted separately in the statistics for each hospital stay. </P>

	<P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has repeatedly expressed his concern about the inadequate supply of appropriate housing in the community for persons suffering mental illness in his annual reports. The inspector has acknowledged the valuable work done by voluntary groups in availing of Department of the Environment and Local Government funding to provide excellent residential facilities throughout the State. Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this area. I assure the Deputy in this regard that the future communitisation of our mental health services, including measures to address the needs of schizophrenia sufferers and their carers, will be considered in the context of the Estimates pro<Col N="825"/>cess for 2005 and subsequent years. Such considerations, as in the past, will involve discussions between officials of the Department of Health and Children and service providers and users.</P>

I am committed to encouraging the activities of such voluntary organisations.

    <P>The other organisation referred to by the Deputy, the Irish Psychiatric Association, which was established in 2001, is an organisation of psychiatrists focused on policy and service development. One-off funding of &euro;15,000 was made available to the association in 2001 towards the cost of its inaugural conference, which focused on the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P><?oasys _cp8-?><P>*2004 audited accounts are not yet available</P>

	<P>In the context of an overall review of speed limits carried out against the background of the metrication of such limits generally, county and city managers were asked in January 2003 to examine the position in their areas. The authorities were also asked to examine locations where speed limits might not be appropriate and to take appropriate action. Both the Automobile Association and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry subsequently presented the Department with lists of more than 50 locations around the country in respect of which they had received representations questioning the speed limits currently in place. The details of current and suggested limits, as received from the AA and SIMI, were forwarded to the relevant managers for their consideration. Reports have been received from the four Dublin local authorities in response to the issues highlighted by the AA and SIMI.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the incident that took place on 17 September 2004. I am advised by the interim railway safety commission that it expects to receive a report into the incident from Connex, the tram operator, shortly. Shortly after the incident, two inspectors from the interim commission inspected the scene and since then have been monitoring the investigation by Connex. The interim commission is also keeping in contact with the Garda regarding its investigation. It would be inappropriate to speculate on the likely cause of the collision before Connex finalises its report and while the Garda investigation is ongoing.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides that where it is not possible to identify the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle which has exceeded the speed limit, a fixed charge notice is issued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the registered owner of the vehicle concerned. This can occur for instance where the commission of a speeding offence is detected by a camera. The notice conveys details of the commission of an alleged offence and indicates that no prosecution will be initiated if the driver pays a fixed charge within a 28 or 56 day period and accepts two penalty points on his driving licence record. The notice also conveys to the registered owner that if he or she was not driving or otherwise using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, he or she should complete and return within 28 days a form providing information including the name and address of the person who was driving or otherwise using the vehicle.</P>
    <P>It is an offence for a registered owner to fail to comply with the requirement to supply such information. Furthermore, it is an offence if a registered owner gives information whether or not contained in a document which is to his or her knowledge false or misleading. In that context, it should be particularly noted that the Road Traffic Act, 2002 also provides that where the registered owner of the vehicle concerned does not furnish information to the effect that some other person was driving or otherwise using the vehicle, in a prosecution of that owner for the alleged offence, it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that he or she was driving or otherwise using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. Thus where a registered owner does not pay the fixed charge or does not communicate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that anyone else was driving the vehicle at the relevant time, a prosecution may be initiated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>Persons convicted of the commission of an offence of exceeding a speed limit will, unless the court imposes a disqualification from driving, have four penalty points endorsed on their licence record in the national driver file.</P>

In addition, the sub-district is policed by a mobile patrol 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s legislative programme makes provision for a Bill to abolish ground rents. As I have stated previously, publication of the Bill is subject to the resolution of possible constitutional and practical difficulties. The constitutional difficulties relate to the respective rights of ground rent tenants and landlords while the practical difficulties concern land law generally and in particular the land registration system.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple in dwelling houses is contained in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act 1978. Part III of that Act provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby a person may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their dwelling house. The value of a lease to a landlord increases the closer the lease is to expiry and the best advice to give tenants is to buy out a ground rent in good time. This will avoid the extra costs attaching to the purchase of the ground rent where a lease is close to expiry. This has been the consistent advice offered by Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <P>As I have previously stated there are over 650 staff members employed by my Department in the provision of services for or in respect of non-nationals. Unfortunately, it has been the case that more than 70% of those staff are engaged full time in activities associated with the actual processing of asylum claims or in the provision of support for asylum applicants. However, the major reduction in the numbers of asylum applicants is now giving me an opportunity to re-focus those resources on areas of service provision for non-nationals which are under-resourced at this point in time. The citizenship area is one of the areas which will benefit from that process.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>when a decision will be made on the application for a grant by a centre (details supplied ) in County Kerry under the child care capital programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[23029/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that a capital grant application for more than &euro;3.2 million was submitted by the group to my Department some time ago. This is one of the highest grant amounts ever sought for a single project under the programme.</P>
    <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006, and following the mid-term review additional funding of approximately &euro;12 million was made available for <Col N="834"/>the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;449.3 million.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date, numbering more than 1,100 at a value of &euro;114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under the programme covers the period to end 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times. In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP including the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme&rsquo;s objectives and this has brought to &euro;157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the current programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently exceeds &euro;30 million, of which about &euro;25 million is being earmarked for community based not for profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.</P>
    <P>I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries and I understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process to which I have just referred. I understand that the recommendations regarding allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommend<Col N="835"/>ation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight time frame. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it may be considered again should additional capital resources come available and if the project has adequately demonstrated that it would merit funding under the programme during the review process. The allocation of any additional funding which might come available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the group in question has previously been approved a total of &euro; 362,927 in staffing supports under the programme. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the existing radio communications system in use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in need of replacement and steps are under way to introduce a replacement digital radio system. In this regard, a pilot digital radio system covering the Dublin north central division and traffic section, Dublin Castle has been completed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Following its successful completion, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prepared a business case for the extension of the system on a nationwide basis and this was submitted to me by the Garda Commissioner for consideration.</P>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and Department of Finance on the most appropriate way to progress the project. Until these discussions have concluded, it is not possible to be definitive on an exact date when the system will be expanded beyond the pilot areas. Notwithstanding the decision to be taken on replacing the Garda radio system, and in recognition that the current system must be maintained, significant expenditure has been invested in the existing system. Some &euro;1 million was expended in capital equipment at the end of 2003 with further expenditure taking place this year. This does not take away from the requirement for an enhanced Garda radio system, but it demonstrates my commitment to maintain the existing system in operational use until it can be replaced.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the current personnel strength of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, all ranks, as at the 29 September 2004 is 119.</P>
    <P>The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. There are currently two sergeants and 13 garda&iacute; assigned to community policing in Fitzgibbon Street with three vacancies to be filled in the near future. Two community garda&iacute; are assigned to the Ballybough and Clonliffe areas and this area is covered regularly on mobile and foot patrols by plain clothes and uniformed garda&iacute;. In addition, divisional mobile units also pay regular attention to the area concerned. No arrests have been made in respect of any burglaries committed in the areas mentioned in the week ending 25 September 2004. This issue was discussed, <i>inter alia</i>, with approximately 200 residents of the area, at a meeting held by local Garda management on 28 September at the Tivoli Centre. At that meeting local Garda management assured the residents that Garda resources and higher Garda visibility would be directed to the areas concerned. A further meeting has been arranged for two weeks&rsquo; time.</P>

	<P>Under the Equal Status Act 2000 the Equality Authority has power to prepare codes of practice. However, there is no such power in relation to licensed premises.</P>
    <P>There is no basis in licensing law for the adoption of codes of conduct, and there are no such codes. There are, however, substantive and extensive statutory provisions relating to drunkenness, disorderly conduct and under-age consumption of alcohol in the licensing acts. Cases of alleged discrimination in relation to licensed premises can be taken in the District Court under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that as the Estimates process has not been finalised to date, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the level of funding which will be allocated to the Legal Aid Board for 2005.</P>
    <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that the level of resources provided to the Legal Aid Board has increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 1997 the grant-in-aid available to the board was &euro;10.656 million. The figure for 2004 represents an increase of almost 73% during this period.</P>

	<P>I have no plans at present to introduce fines of up to &euro;400 on children charged with minor offences or to send fixed penalty notices directly to the children&rsquo;s parents. The law on the imposition of fines on child offenders by a court is set out at sections 108 to 110 of the Children Act 2001. These provisions, with the exception of subsection (1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of section 110, came into operation on 1 May 2002 and I have no plans to change them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Women&rsquo;s Human Rights project is one of 70 projects which is being funded under the equality for women measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. These projects are being funded on a once off basis with the intention of generally mainstreaming the learning into various policy arenas on their conclusion. It is not intended to provide core funding to any of the projects on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The human rights of all people are fundamental to the development of our society and that there is only one human rights community which is, and should be, our entire society. I also believe that women&rsquo;s human rights are indivisible from those of men and children and that the promotion and vindication of human rights is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility and not solely the business of any specialist organisation.</P>
    <P>The Government has been to the forefront in introducing legislation and policies to protect human rights in this jurisdiction. The Human Rights Commission, established to give effect to a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, benefits all sectors of Irish society, including women. The Human Rights Commission Act 2001 provides that at least seven of the 15 human rights commissioners must be women. The European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 further complements and underpins the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In the wider equality context, rights based legislation in the form of the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2000 and more recently the Equality Act 2004 was introduced and supported by an equality infrastructure to defend the rights of the groups named in the equality legislation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also a signatory to a number of important international instruments for promoting women&rsquo;s rights. These include the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, including the optional protocol to that convention and the UN Beijing Platform for Action. Ireland reports periodically to the United Nations on the implementation of these instruments, the most recent being Ireland&rsquo;s report to the United Nations on the national plan for women 2002 on the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and Ireland&rsquo;s combined fourth and fifth reports under CEDAW.</P>

     <Quest>the status of implementation of the Children Act 2001; and the provisions pending and the time frame by which he plans to complete the implementation of each of these provisions.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 is a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, namely, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children&rsquo;s Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act. Significant progress has been made to date.</P>
    <P>Three main areas of the Act for which I have responsibility remain to be brought into operation. These concern the age of criminal responsibility, community-based options, and the provision of children detention centres for 16 and 17 year old offenders.</P>
    <P>One of the primary aims of the Children Act is to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. The community-based options provided for in the Act will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the Probation and Welfare Service. Notwithstanding the public service recruitment embargo, I secured 30 additional staff specifically for the Probation and Welfare Service to implement those provisions of the Act relevant to the Service. The Probation and Welfare Service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand for the intensive training <Col N="844"/>of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</P>
    <P>The family conferencing provisions of the Act were placed on a statutory basis on 29 July. The family conference is convened by the Probation and Welfare Service and the convening of the conference is directed by the court where it considers that the preparation of an action plan would be desirable in an individual case. Other provisions of the act relevant to the Probation and Welfare Service will be introduced on a phased basis as resources allow and the timing of implementation will be contingent on the amount of resources secured for this process through the Estimates allocations for 2005.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old males and females who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</P>
    <P>In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles &mdash; 90 male and 20 female &mdash; is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I gather that the community policing fora to which the Deputy refers is the community &mdash; policing forum project in the Garda &ldquo;A&rdquo; district. As the Deputy is aware, the community policing forum in Dublin&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&rdquo; Garda district &mdash; Kevin St. &mdash; Kilmainham &mdash; was established by the commissioner in 2000 on a pilot basis following upon extensive consultations between the Garda and community interests. The purpose was to improve relations and communications between local communities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The forum was sub-divided into three fora encompassing the following areas: Bluebell, Inchicore and Islandbridge; Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn, Rialto and Kilmainham; and Christchurch, the Coombe, Portobello &mdash; the south west inner city network.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the independent evaluations to which the Deputy refers is a review of the operation of this forum conducted by the Crew Network dated December 2001. One of the main recommendations of that review was for a State funded co-ordinator to assist in the work of the forum. Co-ordinators are provided in certain cases for fora through funding under the national drug strategy. In a reply to Deputy Costello&rsquo;s question on 9 December 2003, I described in detail the operation of such fora, the mechanisms for funding and my plans for the future in this regard. In my reply to Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s question on this topic on 9 December 2003, I outlined the reasons as to why it is not possible or appropriate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to fund the requested co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>In May of this year, a delegation on behalf of the Rialto community policing forum, led by Deputy Ardagh and including the Deputy met with me to discuss provision of funding for the forum. I indicated at the meeting that I am sympathetic towards the case and very supportive of the good work of the forum. At my invitation, the forum subsequently submitted a written proposal in this regard. Having considered the matter further in conjunction with the commissioner, I still agree that such funding is not appropriate for the Garda Vote. However, I have recently written to my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to consider the matter both in the particular situation of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; district but also in the wider context of co-operation between garda&iacute; and local authorities at community level. I have also written to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Michael Conaghan, requesting him to consider how Dublin City Council might assist in this matter.</P>
    <P>The growth of community policing fora in general needs to be delivered in the context of the development of an appropriate policy framework <Col N="847"/>for what are relatively new partnership structures involving the Garda, local authorities and local communities. Such a framework will ensure that such fora can be appropriately developed in a consistent and properly planned manner rather than the <i>ad hoc </i>way in which they have tended to emerge in a number of different contexts to date.</P>
    <P>Work is well under way in regard to the development of such a policy framework which will facilitate progress in this area. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 represents the most significant legislative reform of Garda structures since the foundation of the State. Included in its draft provisions are mechanisms for enhanced co-operation between the Garda and local authorities through the establishment, on a statutory basis, of policing committees. It is intended that such committees will act as fora where matters relating to all aspects of policing can be discussed and where strategies and recommendations for dealing with issues arising locally can be decided. It is intended that these policing committees will facilitate the establishment of local policing fora to address specific issues in local areas.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all ranks, as at 16 September 2004 was approximately 12,150. In April 2002, the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the force by 200 to 12,200. Recruitment was carried out during 2003 with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,200 by 31 December 2004. I am confident, as is the Garda Commissioner, that this figure will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government stated that the Government would complete the previous programme of expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which aimed at a strength of 12,000, and then increase the strength by a further 2,000. This commitment remains and I will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future with a view to increasing recruitment towards achieving the target of 14,000.</P>
    <P>The allocation of Garda resources generally and for the enforcement of road traffic offences in particular is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am confident that any additional resources provided to the Commissioner will be used to optimum effect and in a focused way, as will the allocation of current resources.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy 2004-06 which was launched last week forms the frame<Col N="851"/>work within which road safety policy will be developed over the coming years. Many of the targets and actions recommended in the strategy are already at various stages of implementation or planning, including the private operation of speed cameras and the outsourcing of the collection of fixed charge fines. Under the Road Traffic Bill 2004, which the Minister for Transport has published, these initiatives will be fully implemented and will facilitate the removal of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from routine administrative duties and the redeployment of these resources for the purposes of front line policing and enforcement.</P>

     <Quest>the number of prisoners who participated in training courses during 2003 while incarcerated; the number of these who completed or failed to complete this training; the number of those beginning training in prison who continued it upon release; and the number of prisoners who obtained diplomas while incarcerated.</Quest>

	<P>I am informed by the director general of the Irish Prison Service that records of prisoner participation in vocational training programmes are not maintained in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy without the expenditure of significant staff time and involving considerable financial cost. However, I am also informed that the Irish Prison Service is developing a service-wide computerised vocational training programme database to record, on a prisoner by prisoner basis, partici<Col N="852"/>pation in vocational training activity and achievement of recognised qualifications. This database will allow for ongoing monitoring of prisoners&rsquo; progress and efficient production of management information. Once operational, it will allow for the production of information of the nature sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In prisons, the main emphasis of the work training programme is to provide employment-training opportunities for prisoners while ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison. The programme involves a range of training and work experience in areas such as catering and laundry, metal work, printing, computers, Braille, woodwork, drawing, construction, clothing manufacture, craft work, farming, horticulture, indexing, painting and decorating, upholstery, baking, and electronics. The range and quality of vocational training opportunities is under continuing review and is being enhanced with a view to the incorporation of more programmes leading to recognised qualifications. Accreditation of vocational training in prisons is provided by a range of agencies, including FETAC, F&Aacute;S, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, City and Guilds of London, engineering inspection services, ECDL and Dublin city libraries.</P>

	<P el="0">For many years, prisoners have been provided with access to testing for various infectious diseases on a confidential basis. Testing may be requested by an individual prisoner or may be recommended by health care staff on the basis of pre-existing risk behaviour or other clinical indication. Testing may either be undertaken within prison or as part of a clinical assessment in external health locations.</P>
    <P>At present, it is not possible to identify the precise number of prisoners who are facilitated with testing for one or more of these conditions. It is hoped the introduction of a computerised health care record system will facilitate the collation of data, on an anonymous basis, regarding the number of such tests.</P>

	<P>Research on prisoners&rsquo; health status, which was commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform and carried out by the department of health promotion at NUI Galway, was published in 2000. Entitled General Healthcare Study of the Irish Prisoner Population, the study indicated that prisoners reported overall poorer levels of health compared to the general population. In particular, indicators of mental health were significantly worse among prisoners and prisoners showed higher levels of drug and alcohol abuse relative to the general population.</P><Col N="854"/>
    <P>Within the health care resources available, steps are taken to provide prisoners with health care related information which would serve to assist them in following a healthier lifestyle. Any information in written form provided as part of public health awareness campaigns is generally made available to prisoners, either through health care sources or in prison libraries.</P>

	<P>As part of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s commitment to encouraging prisoners in their efforts to live law abiding and purposeful lives after release, the service continues to place strong emphasis on the provision of education and vocational training for prisoners during their time in prison. The range of these services available across the different prisons and places of detention is substantial and varied and is provided by a multiplicity of statutory, community and voluntary agencies and groups working in partnership with the Irish Prison Service.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory instruments establishing St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and the different places of detention specify a requirement that the inmates in these institutions shall be given, in so far as the period of their detention permits, training and treatment intended to encourage and assist them to lead law abiding and self-supporting lives. These provisions will be amplified by new provisions on education and vocational training which will be included in the proposed new prison rules currently at an advanced state of drafting, with a view to replacing the Rules for the Government of Prisons 1947.</P><Col N="854"/>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the level of resources provided to the Legal Aid Board has increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 1997 the grant-in-aid available to the board was &euro;10.656 million. The figure for 2004 represents an increase of almost 73% during this period and I would expect that the funding for the board will be further increased in 2005.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>I can assure the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times at a law centre, for whatever reason, become excessive, the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and <Col N="856"/>such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priority treatment is necessary to ensure that persons subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with a speedy service. It is important to note that in 2003, priority appointments offered by law centres were approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</P>
    <P>In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status.</P>

	<P>As I said in my reply of 5 May 2004 to the Deputy, I have asked for an examination of the range of penalties that should be applicable to firearms offences. I am sure that the Deputy and the House will agree that there needs to be stringent penalties for firearms related offences and I do not, at this stage, rule out the possibility that, where appropriate, mandatory penalties should be available to the courts for such offences.</P>
    <P>In the course of the development of any such proposals, my Department will examine research and reports on similar measures in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States of America to inform its decisions.</P>

	<P>Any application of this nature would have to be dealt with within the present statutory framework governing asylum seekers and refugees, namely, the Refugee Act 1996 which, <i>inter alia</i>, is the legislative mechanism through which the State meets its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees.</P>
    <P>Section 8(1) of the 1996 Act imposes an obligation on the State to accept applications for a declaration of refugee status from persons who arrive at the frontiers of the State or persons who are at any time in the State. No provision is made for the acceptance of applications from persons <Col N="858"/>outside the jurisdiction. The person concerned is currently resident in Israel.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Refugee Act 1996, which deals with programme refugees, provides<i>, inter alia</i>, for the admission to the State of a person to whom leave to enter and remain for protection or resettlement, as part of a group of persons, has been given by the Government and whose name is entered in a register established and maintained by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Such persons are usually admitted as part of Ireland&rsquo;s annual programme refugee quota of up to ten cases, categorised as vulnerable persons, which are selected based on a submission from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees following an objective analysis of the status of the persons concerned by the UNHCR and the need for resettlement as a durable solution.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Question No. 326 on 29 September 2004, in which he indicated that the Government will continue to monitor the position of the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>

	<P>The announcement of a review of the incitement to hatred legislation was made by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a time when few if any successful prosecutions had been taken under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. <Col N="859"/>One of the aims of the review was to ascertain whether problems with the Act itself were contributing to this lack of prosecutions and, if so, whether any reasonable changes to it could remedy that situation. Since the review was announced, a number of successful prosecutions have been taken under the 1989 Act and, where appropriate, under public order legislation or Coras Iompair &Eacute;ireann by-laws. These trends are being monitored as part of the ongoing review and if maintained could have a significant influence on the outcome of the review and any subsequent proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>Two international instruments, the Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime dealing with criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks and a European Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, which has not yet been finalised, will also be considered to fully <Col N="860"/>assess their implications in the context of the review.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy on waste management is set out in the policy documents Changing our Ways 1998, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change 2002 and Taking Stock and Moving Forward 2004. The Government&rsquo;s approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention/minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and, finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have adopted waste management plans which, informed by the performance targets set out in these policy statements, call for the provision of modern integrated waste management services and infrastructure. A decision on the development of a landfill facility is a matter for the relevant planning authority and for the EPA in the context of applications for planning permission and for a waste licence, respectively. The Minister for the Environment, Heri<Col N="864"/>tage and Local Government is precluded under both legal codes from exercising any direct control in relation to these processes.</P>

    <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 provides that any works of an archaeological nature that are carried out in respect of an approved road development, must be carried out in accordance with directions issued by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of recent concerns expressed in relation to the housing market, including comments by the IMF. These were among a range of views in recent commentaries on the prospects for the housing market. The recent financial stability report from the Central Bank also examined the issue of house prices in Ireland and noted that an alternative approach to valuation, which incorporates the demand for housing both in terms of the service it supplies, and as an investment, does not provide evidence of overvaluation.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain an adequate level of housing supply in keeping with demand and ensuring <Col N="866"/>that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner. I expect that further moderation in the rate of house price increase will ensure that the housing market continues to develop in a balanced way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
    <P>Under the planning, roads and other consent systems, major development projects are subject to environmental impact assessment in accordance with the requirement of EU Directive 85/377/EEC, as amended. This requires, <i>inter alia</i>, the preparation, by the proposer, of an environmental impact statement setting out details of the project and the likely significant effects of the development on the environment, including the cultural heritage. The EIA process allows for adverse effects to be identified at an early stage and necessary changes made by the proposer so that such effects can be avoided or minimised. The environmental impact statement must be taken into account by the consent authority in making its decision on the proposed project.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 which was enacted in July introduces, <i>inter alia</i>, new arrangements to simplify procedures under the National Monuments Acts as regards approved road developments; and to cater for a situation where a national monument is newly discovered which may not have been anticipated in the EIS. All development works must be carried out in accordance with the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 which provide for the safeguarding of monuments and archaeological sites. My Department&rsquo;s framework and principles for the protection of the archaeological heritage address the protection of the archaeological heritage in the context of development: while development should attempt, where possible, to avoid impacts on the archaeological heritage and <Col N="867"/>through preservation <i>in-situ</i>, nonetheless preservation by record, through archaeological excavation and recording, may also be acceptable. The Department is consulted on all development applications affecting the archaeological heritage, which number some 9,000 per annum. This consultation process allows for inputs to ensure that archaeological considerations are taken into account as part of the approval process.</P>
    <P>My Department is also actively engaged with the development sector to ensure that archaeological considerations are taken into account at the earliest stage in project design. Codes of practice for the protection of the archaeological heritage are already in place with a number of development bodies including the National Roads Authority, Coillte, the ESB National Grid, Bord G&aacute;is and the Irish Concrete Federation. A Bill to consolidate the national monuments code is currently in preparation and in this context consideration will be given to what further changes might be made to improve current systems and procedures. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the balance between conservation and development in an open and transparent way whilst endeavouring to smooth the approvals processes and I am satisfied that progress has been made in this regard in recent years. Nevertheless, as the Deputy will appreciate, notwithstanding the various checks and balances that are in place, situations will inevitably arise where some parties may seek to have their grievances addressed by way of legal action.</P>

	<P>My Department published the Irish National Survey of Housing Quality 2001-2002 on 11 December, 2003. The survey provides an assessment of the current condition of the national housing stock based on a survey of a representative sample of 40,000 householders and assesses progress since the last survey was undertaken in 1990. The large sample provides an overview of the housing situation with regard to housing quality at a national level and allows for the provision of statistics at county level.</P>
    <P>The survey is representative of all tenures; privately owned, privately rented, local authority, renting in the voluntary and co-operative sector and rent-free and covers various types of accommodation such as houses, apartments etc. The report examines a broad range of housing issues, of which the main ones are quality of dwelling, dwelling size and rooms available, the level of <Col N="868"/>satisfaction of the householder with the dwelling, services and utilities, affordability and energy efficiency. The survey results show that the vast majority of households surveyed are satisfied with the general condition of their accommodation, with their area and neighbourhood and with running costs. A copy of the survey is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options currently available to assist lower income households to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</P>
    <P>As regards local authority housing, my Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and redeveloping their housing stock through the remedial works and the regeneration programmes. A provision of &euro;168 million is available in the current year to local authorities for the regeneration and redevelopment of run down estates.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet handbook requires Departments to ensure that all memoranda for the Government containing any significant policy proposals or other measures, including legislation, should indicate the impact, if any, of the proposals on rural communities, that is, on the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in the open countryside, in coastal areas, towns and villages and in smaller urban centres outside of the five major urban areas. Accordingly, each Minister is required to ensure that the rural development dimension of every major proposal is appropriately addressed.</P>
    <P>The circulation of draft memoranda for Government to Departments prior to their finalisation also enables me through my Department to have input to the development of proposals likely to affect rural communities.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, details of Departments&rsquo; expenditure allocations for the current year are set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2004 which was published earlier in the year. A gross total of &euro;298 million has been allocated to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, across four programme expenditure areas, broadly as follows: 
Administration, 
&euro; 17 million;
An Ghaeilge agus an Gaeltacht, 
&euro; 85 million; 
Community Affairs, 
&euro;133 million; 
Rural Affairs, 
&euro; 63 million.</P>
    <P>Expenditure within these programme areas, which totalled &euro;174.7 million at 24 September 2004, takes place across a wide range of schemes and projects, descriptions of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my Department will continue to ensure delivery of our objectives under An Agreed Programme for Government and that expenditure for the year will be in line with the allocated amount.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, it is the practice of both my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and myself, to make details of all announcements relating to grant approvals and other expenditure related decisions under these programmes, available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated previously, my Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy addresses many of my concerns in relation to such issues as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities, while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. <Col N="871"/>In this way it seeks ensure the key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, agrees that it is vitally important that there is certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in relation to rural housing through their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, on 4 March last, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, published the consultation draft of guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing. These draft guidelines are vitally important in order that there is clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in relation to rural housing. They provide a more detailed framework for planners, based on what the national spatial strategy has to say on rural housing policy. The guidelines reflect what I have been saying for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>As I said in my statement at the time welcoming the publication of the draft guidelines, what is needed is rural housing within the confines of good planning practice.</P>
    <P>I understand that the consultation process has been concluded and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government expects to publish the definitive guidelines later in the year.</P>

    <P>The Northern Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned applied for assistance in respect of a rent deposit.
