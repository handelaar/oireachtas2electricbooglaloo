   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 32, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>I met with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Ahmed Qurei, on 11 February. The visit to Dublin was his first outside the Middle East since entering office. We discussed the generally deteriorating situation in the Middle East with particular consideration of the prospects for political progress, the security situation and <Col N="136"/>humanitarian issues. A comprehensive joint communiqu&eacute; was issued after the meeting, which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>I opened the conference Breaking the Barriers: Partnership to Fight HIV-AIDS in Europe and Central Asia, in Dublin Castle on 23 February. President Sampaio of Portugal, Prime Minister Nastase of Romania, Mary Robinson, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Bob Geldof were among those who addressed the two-day international conference, attended by representatives of 55 countries, with people working in the areas of education, fundraising and research on HIV-AIDS. In my address, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the fight against the HIV-AIDS pandemic, which remains a global threat. While sub-Saharan Africa is bearing the brunt of the disease, it continues to spread in our region at an alarming rate. Explosive infection rates are being recorded in eastern Europe and central Asia. Partnership is key to the fight against HIV-AIDS and must remain on the agenda of dialogue between the enlarged EU and its neighbours.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>I reminded the conference of my announcement in 2001 to increase our annual funding of HIV-AIDS programmes by $30 million per year. That pledge has been honoured and our annual spending now exceeds $40 million. In addition, we contributed $25 million to the global fund over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I also spoke of the importance of focusing on Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in regard to HIV-AIDS and, in particular, the need for an educated, supportive and accepting attitude towards the many Irish people bravely living with HIV-<?oasys _jy?>AIDS.</P>
    <P>I met King Abdullah of Jordan on 1 March for a working lunch. Our discussions were positive, covering our strong bilateral relations and the international situation. His Majesty wished to encourage Irish investment in Jordan, including as a gateway to Iraq for reconstruction work in association with Jordanian firms.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland was the primary focus of my visit to Washington last month. In addition to affording me the opportunity to brief President Bush and members of the Senate and Congress on the review and the need to inject a greater urgency in the process, I had the opportunity to meet Northern Ireland civic and political leaders who had been invited to Washington. I also attended the American Ireland Fund dinner.</P>
    <P>I am extremely grateful for the continued support of President Bush and his Administration and our friends in the Senate and Congress for our efforts in regard to Northern Ireland. They offered their strong encouragement in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I thanked President Bush for the expressions of US support and solidarity following the callous bombings in Madrid. We discussed the ongoing war on terrorism and had a wide-ranging exchange of views on a number of international issues, including the Middle East.</P><Col N="137"/>
    <P>I also discussed with President Bush his forthcoming visit to Ireland for the EU-US summit on 26 June. Such summits are an integral feature of EU-US relations and occur on an annual basis. As a rule, summits are held in the state which holds the Presidency at that time. They provide an opportunity to review important issues of shared interest and concern at the highest levels on both sides, to arrive at decisions for joint or complementary work and to address issues where there may be differences between the two sides. The agenda will cover a range of bilateral, economic and regional issues.</P>
    <P>The details of that agenda have not yet been finalised and are the subject of ongoing discussions between Irish officials, the European Commission and our US partners. The arrangements for the visit will be brought forward in the coming months.</P>
    <P>As regards my planned discussions with EU leaders on the occasion of the ceremonies to welcome the ten new member states on 1 May, I will meet all of my colleagues over dinner in Farmleigh on the evening of 1 May. I will also meet the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, on the morning of 1 May and will have a joint press conference with them.</P>
    <P>I will meet the Prime Minister of Slovenia in Dublin on Sunday, 2 May. This meeting forms part of my schedule of meetings with all EU leaders in the run up to the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 June. I expect our discussions to focus on preparations for the summit in June and the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>I will also have the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair for discussions during his visit to Dublin at the weekend.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach believe assurances given recently by President Bush to the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Ariel Sharon, are inconsistent with the road map for peace that was endorsed by the quartet, made up of the EU, the US, the UN and Russia? What are the implications for the forthcoming meeting in May of the four partners in that regard?</P>
    <P>In his capacity as President of the European Council, has the Taoiseach raised with President Bush, that many see this recent set of assurances &mdash; if that is the case &mdash; as being a further example of unilateral action by the US in respect of the Israeli-Palestinian problem?</P>
    <P>In his capacity as President of the European Council, did the Taoiseach raise the question of the extra-judicial killings by Israel of Hamas leaders, with his EU counterparts or the Israeli Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the killing of two Hamas leaders over the past month, we have loudly and clearly voiced our opposition to extra judicial killings, particularly to those two. That is <Col N="138"/>the position we take in all cases, not just in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The European Union has listed Hamas as a terror organisation and has acted against the organisation. The threat of terrorism cannot be countered outside international law and legal standards. We have made our position on that absolutely clear. It does nothing to help to resolve issues.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the recent meeting of Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush was discussed at the foreign affairs conference in this country. The European Union Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in the Middle East and assessed the outcome of the recent meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon. Following that meeting, a statement on the Middle East process was issued. There was no change in the position but it reaffirmed the European Union&rsquo;s commitment to a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
    <P>It is believed that the roadmap represents the only route to achieving such a solution. Even though there are difficulties, that is clearly the view. I have had an opportunity to discuss this with a number of people in recent weeks and months and, regardless of the difficulties, everybody concerned is attached to it. The Quartet is still attached to it and believes, in spite of all the difficulties, it is the only basis for achieving a solution. The statement of the Foreign Ministers recalls the European Union&rsquo;s established position that the Union will not recognise any change in the pre-1967 borders, which is the essential difference between what President Bush seems to be saying and what the European Union is saying, other than any agreements that are achieved in negotiation as part of the final negotiations between the parties.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers noted that the refugee question is a final status issue and that the roadmap states that a final and comprehensive permanent status agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must include an agreed just, fair and realistic resolution of the position. They also noted President Bush&rsquo;s reaffirmation of the United States commitment to the roadmap, which was the good part of that communiqu&eacute; from him, as was his agreement that secure and recognised borders would emerge from negotiations between the parties.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question on the reaction to the meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon, there were positive and less positive elements to the exchange between them. There is no doubt about that. We reaffirmed the commitment to the roadmap and to the two-state resolution of final status issues in negotiations. They were all welcomed. I had the opportunity yesterday to discuss these issues at length with the Lebanese Prime Minister who takes an enormous interest in the process and is seen as a very honest broker in the region. The position of the European Union remains that no change in the pre-1967 <Col N="139"/>borders will be recognised unless it comes about as part of the final negotiations between the parties and that the other final status issues and the refugee issues must be negotiated and cannot be pre-judged. That clearly is where the difference of emphasis lies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the situation in Israel and Palestine creates an alibi for terrorism in surrounding countries? Will he, in his capacity as President of the European Union, outline at a future meeting he will have with President Bush in Ireland the difference of opinion between the European Union and the US? I noted that Prime Minister Sharon said he was happy that the United States was backing his particular programme. Have any recent updates been given to the Council in respect of the building of the wall dividing the two territories which, based on tradition in the context of the Berlin Wall, will not led to any resolution?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on a letter to Prime Minister Blair from 52 former senior diplomats in respect of this situation and other conflict situations? Does he have a view or is he concerned about the implications of that based on their extensive experience?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the first issue is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The Middle East situation will be on the agenda. I raised these issues again at the meeting on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. There are many positives in the American position and I have outlined the positives of the two-state position. That is a major change from the position previously adopted by the United States. The issue of the pre-1967 borders is a significant one. Deputy Kenny is correct that the poisonous effect of the ongoing difficulties, particularly in the past three or four years, between Israel and Palestine has had a huge negative effect in the entire region. I heard that first hand yesterday and I was informed about it by the King of Jordan.</P>
    <P>This matter has been discussed with a number of people. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, met President Mubarak a number of weeks ago in respect of it. We have heard the same message from everyone, namely, that major progress will not be forthcoming anywhere in the Middle East. Two different approaches are being taken: the European Union plan and the United States wider Middle East peace process. Either one is unlikely to sustain any great credibility until progress is made. Unfortunately, progress has been extremely slow. If anything, many of the events of recent months have made matters more difficult.</P>
    <P>As stated on many previous occasions, I have another difference with President Bush on this matter, namely, that he has no time for President Arafat. Mr. Bush sees him only as an obstacle to progress, whereas the European Union and I share the view that in spite of his advancing age and declining health, he remains part of the <Col N="140"/>solution. Most people in the European Union hold strongly to that view. He remains the elected leader of his people. We must also ensure that we give total recognition to the work of Mr. Qurei and the Foreign Minister, who are leading the discussions, and that we do not try to draw distinctions between them because that would be entirely unhelpful. Everyone from the region has said that in dealing with President Arafat we should also deal with the new Prime Minister and the new Foreign Minister and not undermine their position in any way. There are some subtleties involved here about which Members are aware.</P>
    <P>Europe has made it clear that we cannot accept the separation barrier built on Palestinian land. It has been said that the barrier would best serve Israel&rsquo;s long-term security but I believe its construction is a mistake. It will prove divisive and will play no part in a solution. The European Council again expressed its concerns last week about the route envisaged for the separation barrier and the departure of that route from the green line in the West Bank. It has been made clear that the appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal and contrary to international law. The restrictions associated with the separation barrier are having a major detrimental effect on Palestinian society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that targeted assassinations of Palestinian leaders have no more moral legal authority than suicide bombings and, if so, has he represented that view to the Israeli authorities? As President of all the Europeans, has he received representations from other European leaders in respect of taking economic sanctions against Israel? If not, can he suggest any pragmatic leverage that might be used to restore some sense of proportion to the Middle East conflict?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated earlier, the European Union has listed Hamas as a terrorist organisation and acted against it. It has stated that the threat of terrorism cannot be met by acting outside international law and legal standards. That is clearly a reference to the actions of Hamas and Islamic Jihad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>So that is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in respect of suicide bombings. Only one interpretation can be read into that. The Israelis may have had an earlier view about us but following our meetings with them, they accept that we hold a balanced and fair position, namely, that we oppose all acts of terror, but particularly those carried out by suicide bombers.</P>
    <P>Extra-judicial killings are outside international law and are not accepted by the organised world as a way of dealing with the problem facing the Israelis.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="141"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not entirely clear from that reply where we stand. The Taoiseach seems to be saying these acts cannot be condoned and are manifestly outside international law. Does the Taoiseach condemn the targeted execution of Palestinian leaders? I know how the Israelis regard Hamas, but does the Taoiseach condemn the selective murders of Palestinian leaders and has he represented that view to the Israelis? He explained what the Israelis have represented to us but has he represented a view to them? Has he considered taking any initiative, either as Leader of the Government or as President of the EU, to bring home that view to the Israeli authorities? I asked specifically whether he had any representations from any member state in respect of the taking of or putting in place of economic sanctions against Israel while Mr. Sharon remains on the rampage? If he has not, are there any other pragmatic measures or initiatives he thinks might be taken?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte said he is not clear on where we stand. Let us be very clear. I am saying that the targeting of Palestinian leaders is totally wrong. We have condemned it clearly to the Israelis and have shown our opposition to the extra-judicial killings. We have made this clear numerous times and ways over the past five weeks since the case was made. The Deputy asked earlier about the suicide bombings and I already replied to Deputy Kenny on that matter. We have equally condemned them and have been fair on the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion but no representation on economic sanctions. There was some discussion about suspending the association agreements with Israel in view of the continued violations of human rights in the territories. The view is that suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Israel is not on the agenda. There would have to be consensus within the European Union for such a step to be taken. There would not be consensus on that issue. The argument has been made that such action would have undesirable consequences such as undercutting the role of the European Union in the peace process and creating major difficulties in implementing our programmes of assistance to the Palestinian Authority. In other words, it would be counter productive. That is the view held by the vast majority of states and strongly held by President Chirac and others.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the association agreement reinforces obligations which already fall to the signatories with respect to human rights. It is the European Union&rsquo;s view that the meetings of the association councils with Israel provide an opportunity to highlight the concerns on human rights to the Israeli authorities and that suspending the agreements would not be good tactics and would be counter productive. The people who would suffer most are the people we are trying to assist, namely, the Palestinians.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about his visit to the United States and his discussions with President Bush. He mentioned in his reply that he mainly dealt with the issue of Northern Ireland and I am glad to hear that. He also dealt with global terrorism, an issue which also needed to be discussed.</P>
    <P>As regards President Bush&rsquo;s visit to Ireland, the Taoiseach said in his reply that the agenda was not yet clear. When might it become clear? Is the Taoiseach concerned that on the American side the main focus will be photo opportunities based on the need for President Bush to garner support from the Irish-American voting public? Will he set out exactly what the agenda will be if it is not to be primarily that?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not mention the security arrangements to be put in place, which I asked about in one of my questions. Is it the case, as we have heard, that United States Air Force Eagle fighter planes from the UK will cover Irish air space?</P>
    <P>Could the Taoiseach answer the questions raised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties as to whether there is to be status of forces agreement? I understand the purpose of such is to give special powers to US security personnel. Has that been agreed with the United States? Have any instructions been given to US security personnel regarding circumstances where they feel there is a need to open fire? Will instructions be given from the Irish side in that regard, as they were previously by the UK authorities in the case of a similar visit to the UK?</P>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position now, given President Bush&rsquo;s expression of thanks to him for his support during the illegal invasion of Iraq and his own statement that he was against the war in Iraq? Would he agree that the statement of Mr. James Kenny, the US Ambassador to Ireland, that Ireland behaved like an ally, flies in the face of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that he was against the war? In that context and to clarify the matter in terms of the polls, will he end US military use of Shannon to make his position absolutely clear?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The priority issues are obviously EU-US bilateral issues. The agenda will be finalised, as happens in regard to all of these meetings, fairly close to the date of the meeting. As Deputy Sargent knows, such meetings are held regularly and the country that holds the Presidency hosts the meetings. That is standard practice and has been for a number of years.</P>
    <P>President Bush does not need photo opportunities. He does not need to court publicity in this way. He tends to get it anyway, as the Deputy probably noticed. He does not need to come to Ireland in order to get his photograph in the paper, unlike some people in this House. That would not be a priority for him.</P>
    <P>This year&rsquo;s summit provides a good opportunity to restore stability and vitality to the US relationship with the EU. It is our aim as EU <Col N="143"/>President to build on what has been a noticeable improvement in the relationship over recent months and to deliver a summit that reconfirms the importance of the US partnership with the EU, our own citizens and the broader international community. There are many issues on the EU agenda, including world trade, the UN and other political and economic issues. The meeting will not be very different from other such meetings. It will take matters up from where they are at the time.</P>
    <P>On security issues, any decisions will be made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or in association with the Garda. Nobody may act outside Garda control or in a manner which is not in accordance with any decisions the Garda would make. The Garda will have the ultimate say and we are likely to agree with its advice on any issues it raises. These issues will be in the hands of the Garda.</P>
   <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I answered questions on Iraq in the House for a lengthy period. My prime concern throughout this issue and during our period on the Security Council, was to work hard to maintain the primacy of the Security Council and the UN at the heart of this issue. We did so all the way until the end. When it was no longer possible to do so, it broke down and nothing more could be done by us or by the UN. We are still actively involved in that process &mdash; I was involved in it yesterday. We are trying to get a new Security Council resolution in this crucial period as we head for an interim administration. The UN is fully, actively and completely involved in that process. The issues to which I have referred will arise in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>A central issue for us is that Kofi Annan and the UN should play a key role. The UN should have the power, ability and resources to do a job that badly needs to be done. Mr. Brahimi&rsquo;s report, which will be produced shortly, will indicate whether that will happen. A new resolution will be required. It is obvious that the early stages of the discussion on the resolution are continuing in the background. A resolution has not been drafted &mdash; it is not even in a draft form. It is inevitable that a draft will be produced in the weeks ahead. We will support that position.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Six weeks have passed since the Taoiseach met the President of the United States in the White House. Believe it or not, this is the first opportunity we have had to question the Taoiseach on the meeting. It was his first visit to Mr. Bush since it was conclusively demonstrated in front of the world that claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were fraudulent. Did the Taoiseach ask Mr. Bush why he put fraudulent claims to him last year about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to justify his bloody invasion of that country? Did he tell Mr. Bush that he repeated the fraudulent claims to the Irish <Col N="144"/>people on many occasions in the House and elsewhere to justify the practical assistance the Government gave to the US and British invasion? Did he demand an apology from Mr. Bush for the political fraud perpetrated on the Irish people? Did he receive such an apology?</P>

	<P>Did he get a receipt?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the cataclysmic circumstances into which the Bush-Blair invasion plunged the Iraqi people &mdash; I refer in particular to the massacre of hundreds of innocent men, women and children by US forces in Fallujah &mdash; does the Taoiseach feel any guilt for having helped the invasion and for continuing to facilitate the occupation of Iraq by allowing the US forces to continue to use the facilities at Shannon?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s statement that this is the first opportunity we have had to discuss my meeting with Mr. Bush is incorrect, as he raised the matter with me on Leaders&rsquo; Questions. This is the first time that the matter has been discussed on Question Time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows that the issue has not changed in the past year. The opinion of the EU and Ireland at the time was not just based on what the Americans were saying. It is obvious that what they said is now the subject of examinations and investigations in the UK and the US. The fact is that it went back to the 1991 position, which was clearly believed. The clear view was that there were weapons of mass destruction, which were used against the Kurds on several occasions by the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>Until the very end &mdash; until the 6 March report &mdash; Mr. Blix&rsquo;s view was that weapons existed, but he wanted more time. The difference of emphasis is that he wanted more time to continue his investigations, but the Americans would not give it to him. We support the view of the UN that there should have been more time. It was not, as Deputy Higgins continues to state, based only on a view of what the Americans were saying. It was based on a factual position that had gone back to 1991. It was based on what Hans Blix had said on many occasions in the preceding 12 months. As I have said, there was a difference of timing, as Mr. Blix wanted the period of investigation to continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins misleads people when he says there were never weapons of mass destruction. It must be remembered that thousands of people were killed in Iraq at the hands of Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction.</P>

	<P>I raised the issue of flaws in US intelligence. The Deputy will be aware that there are congressional hearings into this matter. I will reiterate what the record states because I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The Government did not rely on US intelligence, instead basing its approach on 12 years of UN Security Council resolutions that stated Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. UN Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted on the basis that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This belief was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;widely shared in the international community. The General Affairs Council in November 2002 and the Security Council on 19 and 20 November 2002 could not have been clearer when they stated that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This was despite that there was no agreement at the time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

	<P>On 6 March, Dr. Blix, head of the arms inspection teams mandated to investigate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, informed the Security Council that many questions relating to this matter remained unanswered.

	<P>In the course of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the Palestinian Prime Minister, what practical supports were offered by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Irish people, or in his role as President of the European Council, for the Palestinian people&rsquo;s ongoing campaign of opposition to the construction of the apartheid wall in the West Bank? Did he reiterate and reassure the Palestinian Prime Minister in the course of their meeting of EU support for the orderly Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the direct handing over of the area&rsquo;s governance to the Palestinian Authority?</P>
    <P>Was the ending of the special trade arrangements between the EU and Israel addressed? Does the Taoiseach believe that such special arrangements should end pending Israel&rsquo;s adherence to UN resolutions on the Palestinian question? Does he agree that real action on the part of the international community is the only hope for the Palestinian people, as it provides a real alternative to their own strategy of despair as represented by suicide bombings?</P>
    <P>At the meeting with Mr. Bush for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s week celebrations, did the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity to express his and the Irish people&rsquo;s concerns about the continuing Anglo-American occupation of Iraq? Could the Taoiseach tell the House from where came the proposal to hold the EU-US summit in Ireland? Was it an Irish proposal or did it come from the Bush Administration? Does the Taoiseach agree with the statement of the UN representative in Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, who has cautioned the US against implementing a full-scale military offensive on the cities of Falluja and Najaf as it would amount to a collective attack on their citizenry, potentially leading to many thousands of deaths? As holder of the Presidency of the European Union and as our Taoiseach, will he indicate his position? I hope he will back the call of the UN representative so that such a terrible vista will not be witnessed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the position in the Middle East, throughout last year, in preparation for the Presidency, the Government, mainly through the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been involved in a series of meetings with both sides, trying to assist in every possible way and make progress in an even-handed manner. As Deputies know, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, visited the region twice last year and again during the Presidency. During two separate visits last year he met representatives of Israel and of the Palestinian Authority. This year he met the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Sharon. In Ireland, we met the foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority. We have had lengthy meetings with these people.</P><Col N="147"/>
    <P>During our time as holders of the European Presidency, we have followed an even-handed approach. We have tried to assist the Palestinians in being constructive in their position and in their opposition and in building a case that will win support not only from the Quartet but also internationally. We have been actively engaged in this process and the Israelis know the part we have been playing. We have also kept in touch with the Israelis and tried to help them as much as we can. We have kept in touch with the other members of the Quartet, Russia and the USA, in the context of our role in the EU. That has been useful.</P>
    <P>However, there are still enormous difficulties. The Deputy asked whether I reiterated EU support for the orderly Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Our position is that provided it is not seen as part of the final settlement and done in an orderly, constructive way, and that the international community is aware of it, it is a withdrawal which is acceptable to the international community. Five conditions were laid down for the withdrawal: it must be in the context of the road map it must be a step towards a two-nation state; it must not involve the transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; there must be an organised, negotiated hand-over of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority; and Israel must facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza. In the spring European Council we put forward a resolution on how this should be handled and we have since followed that up at foreign affairs meetings. The position has been made clear. Obviously, the difficulties in the matter of extra-judicial killings have not helped.</P>
    <P>I have already explained to Deputy Rabbitte the matter of trade and accession agreements. Economic sanctions would be seen as counter-productive and the people who would suffer most are the Palestinians. It would not work and there would probably not be full agreement on the matter.</P>

    <P>On the United States and Iraq, our position is centred on the Brahimi report and getting all his work properly structured so that the UN will come in after 30 June and the terms of that and the settlement will be outlined. That was set out clearly in the statement by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is in the public domain following last week&rsquo;s issue.</P>
    <P>I answered the question at the Forum on Europe a few weeks ago on the choice of Ireland as the location for the summit. I keep answering the question but people just ignore the answer. What has happened for years is that the council switches each time. This year it is in Ireland. Whenever a member state holds the Presidency, the council is held at a location it picks. Last year it was in Washington. In 2001 it was in Gothenburg, Sweden. Before that it was in Washington and the year before that it was in Portugal. The year before that it was in Washington while the year before that it was in Bonn, Germany. It alternates each year.</P>
    <P>If we were to take the position, which I would not have dreamed about taking &mdash; I did not give it one second&rsquo;s consideration &mdash; that &ldquo;Ireland does not want the President of the US&rdquo;, we would change something that has happened for 25 years and not invited him to this country. I did not give a second to it and I would not do so. I would be appalled to make such a decision and the fact that people ask me to make such a decision appals me even more.</P>

	<P>I know the Taoiseach is very busy, but while flying, he might have the opportunity to read Hans Blix&rsquo;s book. Hans Blix is the man whom the Taoiseach said a few minutes ago believed there were weapons of mass destruction which necessitated the invasion of Iraq. It will come as one hell of a shock to the author to hear that he is the cause of the invasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
   </Speaker><?oasys _ah?>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I scribbled down, and Hans Blix&rsquo;s name was in the middle of the explanation. Is it not a fact that there was a belief that there were weapons of mass destruction and in the need for the Americans to deal with it, to bring peace and stability to the region? There were no weapons of mass destruction, and instead, a cycle of death and destruction has been unleashed in the region. Even at this late stage, will the Taoiseach say that he will represent that view unequivocally to the American Government, and that he will stop trying to go a bit of the road with everyone? No weapons of mass destruction have been discovered, and the situation is deteriorating daily.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach, as President of the EU, say if any initiative is contemplated that acknowledges that the United States and its allies cannot deal with this situation as it worsens, and that there is a need to persuade the American Government to get a new UN mandate in terms of dealing with the situation that now obtains in Iraq? The whole situation has been disastrous for world peace.</P><?oasys _xh?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In Hans Blix&rsquo;s main report, just before the war started, he stated that many questions relating to Iraq&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction remained unanswered. He said that the country was outside the disarmament obligations. Obviously Hans Blix wanted more time, but he believed that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He was not listened to. <Col N="151"/>I have not yet read his book, but I heard his extended television interview some four weeks ago, and I am aware of the distinction.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in his latter comments. It is now essential that the United Nations obtain a new, clear resolution, not one which gives them control on paper but not in reality. If the United Nations is to implement the Brahimi report, and if there is to be a new resolution to back up a new interim administration, that will have its own difficulties, because that administration will in effect be selected by Mr. Brahimi. Naturally I hope, as no doubt does Deputy Rabbitte, that it will work, but there will be difficulties, and I doubt if a six-month period will allow for elections. However, that is the plan. I do not think it will work in such a short period, nor do most of the people to whom I have spoken in the region.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke to the Lebanese Prime Minister, who has toured the region. He has been Prime Minister for 12 years, and except for a short period, his country has been the only democracy recognised as such in the Middle East region. He told me that the process would take a year or two, and he is probably correct. Deputy Rabbitte is therefore correct too. The United Nations needs a clear resolution which gives the autonomy to move towards a peaceful position, despite all the surrounding difficulties. As I said, that resolution is being discussed, though it is not yet in draft form. It will need to be a powerful resolution, and if it is not, the difficulties and instabilities will continue. From the EU Presidency point of view, we are doing everything we can, in every way, to emphasise that message. There is agreement across the EU that this is how it should be.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if he has satisfied himself following the controversial circumstances around the sale of a holiday home complex in Connemara by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, that measures have been put in place which will prevent this from recurring in the sale of other &Uacute;dar&aacute;s properties; and if similar deficient processes have not occurred during the sale of other &Uacute;dar&aacute;s properties in the recent past.</Quest>
     <QRef>[12131/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8 of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act 1979 sets out the functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and specifies at subsection 8(7) &ldquo;For the purposes of this section, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have power to acquire, receive on transfer, hold, sell, mortgage, lease, let or otherwise dispose of land, buildings, markets, premises or plant and to erect, <Col N="152"/>alter or maintain buildings, markets, premises or plant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the disposal of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s property, therefore, is a matter for the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in accordance with relevant State and EU guidelines and directives, which include the public procurement guidelines (1994) and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies (2001).</P>
    <P>I have no function in regard to individual cases. However, I understand from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the board has set aside its earlier proposals of sale in regard to &ldquo;Tithe Saoire Eanach Mhe&aacute;in&rdquo; following advice from senior counsel on rules pertaining to State aid. My responsibility as Minister is to ensure that the relevant guidelines and directives are adhered to and that best practice prevails. My officials liaise with the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s executive on an ongoing basis in this regard. In this case, and on foot of reports which have been received from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, my officials are examining, within the framework of corporate governance arrangements, the processes and procedure which applied.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The sale of property owned by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta takes place directly on the Minister&rsquo;s instructions. He has asked &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to sell property worth &euro;20 million over the next few years, while in the current year, property worth more than &euro;7 million will be sold. Surely it is a matter for the Minister, having directed the board to sell its property, to insist on new criteria being introduced to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, on the basis that the board &mdash; not the officials &mdash; proposed to accept the third lowest tender. Three tenders went before the board, the lowest of which was recommended. Did the Minister ask for a report on this sale? Did it make clear that there was a document outlining the business proposal contained in the third tender, the one accepted by the board? I understand that no such document was available on the day, yet the board moved ahead on the sale of the property.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not instruct the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to sell any particular properties. I never give any direct instruction to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to sell property. There were discussions between myself and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta because it said it did not have enough money for its capital programme. Discussions were held on the possibility of raising money through the sale of properties. We also had a number of studies carried out on the issue. In general terms, it is my obligation as Minister to ensure that the assets of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s are used in the best interests of the people of the Gaeltacht. Under the Act, the responsibility in the case of any property the board sells, the choice to sell or not to sell, and the procedure it followed, are those of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, as clearly laid out in the Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister proposes to bring in a new Bill to amend the operation of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s <Col N="153"/>na Gaeltachta in the year 2005. Will he bring in such a Bill immediately? On this side of the House we will facilitate such a change, because operations at the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s must change urgently. There should be a scheme of marking when proposals are brought before the board, to denote interest in the Irish language and business plans related to the Irish language. The Minister cannot deny that his office is ordering the board to sell its property. The board did not come up with this plan on its own. Is the Minister insisting that the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s budget be cut, and that the shortfall be met by the fire sale of its properties? Is this the worst possible time to do this, when transparent criteria are not in place, with the public not aware of what is going on? Does the Minister think the public should be so aware?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There are very clear criteria involved in this issue. They include the Public Procurement Guidelines 1994 and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2001. Many State bodies buy and sell property. For years &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been in the business of both buying and selling State property. My role is to make sure that best practice is followed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. Is it being followed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Deputy, allow the Minister to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the sale of any particular property. In this case &mdash; we have to be very careful here &mdash; the sale has not gone ahead. That is public knowledge because the board decided, on legal advice, that the procedures it had followed, specifically relating to State aids, was not compatible with good practice. It aborted the sale, therefore, and it is my understanding that the property might be put back on the market again. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of any tenders made because further bids could be made.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate aspects of this matter is the innocent parties, so to speak, the people who in good faith put in their tenders and provided what would normally be considered, in a tender process, confidential information before that process has been completed. The problem is that they have had details of their tenders put into the public domain. If the process was completed all the information would have to be made available but, as the Deputy is aware, where a process is not completed a certain amount of discretion is afforded because of good procedure.</P>
    <P>I stress once again that there is an absolute obligation on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s &mdash; I have made this clear &mdash; to use the property portfolio to the best advantage of the people of the Gaeltacht. If &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is using the revenue raised from the sale of certain properties to provide other properties <Col N="154"/>or it disposes of certain properties &mdash; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has always had that policy and has disposed of certain properties &mdash; it is wise for it to do that. There is no doubt &mdash; we did studies on this &mdash; that I have encouraged &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to be much more proactive in ensuring best value for money from its extensive property portfolio, which runs to well over &euro;100 million. That is something on which all of us in this House would agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is very simple. Was best practice followed in this case? If it was not, and nobody can argue that it was, how can the Minister ensure best practice will be followed from now on? If that means he has to introduce legislation to change the way the board operates, will he not do that? That is the key issue. The innocent people in all this are the taxpayers because they are not getting the best value for their money.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My obligation is to make sure that best practice is followed. The primary obligation, however, is on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s to ensure it follows best practice because they are the people doing the selling. In this case, as the Deputy is aware because it is on public record, there was a problem in regard to State aids and for that reason they have not proceeded with the sale. The Deputy can take it that there was a flaw in the process. That is public knowledge. They aborted the sale. My officials have been in constant contact with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s on the basis that the next time it proceeds to sell this or any other property it must ensure that best practice is followed.</P>
    <P>In regard to changing the law, there are many State agencies &mdash; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is not unique in this respect &mdash; which can buy and sell property. I believe there would be major resistance in this House if the sale of particular properties became a ministerial function. It would be a drastic step to take the power away from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and not from any other State agency to buy and sell property and vest that power in the Minister. If I attempted to do that, the Deputy would be quickly on his feet to tell me there was undue interference by the Minister in the day-to-day affairs of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if his attention as been drawn to concerns expressed by some heads of State agencies at a recent meeting of the chief executives of public bodies regarding the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[12068/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The meeting concerned consisted of a presentation by an official of my Department followed by a question and answer session. This is one of a series of presentations being made by officials of my Department to <Col N="155"/>public bodies on the provisions of the Official Languages Act. I understand that participants at the meeting sought clarification on a number of factual issues in relation to the legislation, the timescale envisaged for its implementation and the supports available to them as public bodies from my Department and elsewhere in this process. I also understand that the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies regrets that such a negative report of the briefing was carried in the press. In its view, the briefing was most informative in helping its members understand the requirements of the new legislation for their agencies.</P>
    <P>While, as one would expect, questions were indeed raised about possible resource issues, I am told that the overall sense of the meeting was one of welcome by the chief executives for the measured, flexible and practical approach being taken by the Department to the implementation of the Act. I understand that the tone of the meeting was positive and it addressed on a down-to-earth and business-like basis practical arrangements and ideas for improving the delivery of our public services through Irish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe it is desirable that the chief executives of State agencies are not prepared to make public statements on the implementation of this Act on two bases as reported, first, that they are reluctant to criticise what they term the sacred cow and, second, they believe the Minister is not to be reasoned with? What initiative is the Minister prepared to take to make the chief executives come forward, without fear or favour, and say what they really think, and not have reports appearing in the press from people who are afraid to disclose their identity?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. A number of issues arise in this regard. My Department and I are simply implementing an Act of the Oireachtas passed by this House without division. The fundamentals involved here are not to do with me as a person but something on which the Oireachtas clearly decided.</P>
    <P>The second issue is that if a chief executive believes he cannot raise issues in respect of this Act because he believes somebody else thinks it is a sacred cow, that is the chief executive&rsquo;s problem. I would say to that chief executive, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try?&rdquo;. One chief executive wrote to me and I have written a very reasoned reply, but aside from that I do not believe, off the top of my head, that any other chief executive has written to me. Issues were raised, and these have been dealt with reasonably.</P>
    <P>The officials of my Department, who have consistently met the public bodies explaining the issues involved and discussing the draft regulations, are very reasonable people who listen and take on board reasonable issues raised.</P><Col N="156"/>
    <P>As regards myself, my door is always open. I am willing to engage but I can only do so within the confines of the legislation passed by this House. It is surprising that during the long debate that took place in the Oireachtas and over five years of public consultation, with all the accusations made against us to the effect that we were delaying matters, a chief executive did not make some representations during that entire process on the Official Languages Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a basic point in all this. There is something wrong when chief executives of State agencies who have concerns are only prepared to articulate those concerns under the protection of anonymity. We were all here when the Act was passed. However, there is a strong perception that the Minister tends to be unreasonable when it comes to criticising the sacred cow. Another chief executive made the point that, regarding resources and time, if everything produced must be translated, the result will be that one has less information coming from those bodies. With some of the smaller ones, that could be a real problem. Before it becomes such, the Minister should address the matter and find a way of assuring the smaller agencies that they will not be curtailed or limited in the amount of information that they wish to provide because they must produce translations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I must accept that there was such a chief executive. It appears we are talking about one person out of 600 bodies, which means, by logical extension, that 599 are happy. That is not a bad majority. However, if the person has a difficulty, he or she should stand up and come forward to see if I am reasonable.</P>
    <P>No one in this House could argue but that I was willing, sometimes perhaps to the point of boring Deputies, to go through points again and again on the various stages of the Bill as it was passing through the House. We also made a large number of amendments, and much of the early criticism to which I was subjected by the Opposition was that the Bill did not go far enough and that I was being too reasonable and not doing enough. I remember a great many amendments being tabled asking me to go much further. I had to explain patiently why that was not possible in practical terms. Regarding the resources of small bodies, I do not believe they have or will have a problem. The problem relates to mind set more than anything else. In most countries this would be considered the norm.</P>
    <P>Second, as someone who worked in a small voluntary body which, because it was a Gaeltacht co-operative, inevitably had to do everything bilingually, I am more than aware of the realities. We had to produce everything bilingually. As the Deputy knows, the Act provides only for major policy documents and the annual report to be translated. Most bodies have already moved to the stage &mdash; and this has not yet been implemented &mdash; of producing their annual reports <Col N="157"/>bilingually. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has always had to do that. It has never received extra resources for doing such things, and I cannot understand, if it has been practical for a great many bodies to do that for the past 20 years, why it becomes absolutely impossible for some of the major agencies to do the minimum required to ensure that the status of Irish as the first official language is more than a token gesture and that we recognise that there are two official languages here. Those who use Irish are entitled to basic services through that language. As I said, the reality appears to be that one chief executive has raised an issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>At least two are quoted in the article.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Two out of 600 is still good.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Those were the ones prepared to speak when they were guaranteed that their contributions would be confidential.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>These are chief executives of State bodies. As such, they should show more respect for the office of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and for the Oireachtas. If they have a problem they wish to raise, the least that they could do is come forward through the normal channels. Each has a line, since every State body is responsible to some Department. If they feel they cannot come to me, surely they can go to their own Ministers and raise the issue with them. This is a cop-out on the part of certain chief executives who are too lazy to do the minimum to ensure that the rights of Irish speakers are preserved. If they have any guts, they would come out and say who they are and identify their problems, and I will deal with them reasonably.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if he will reconsider his decision not to use the existing and effective structure of ADM to distribute the dormant accounts fund.</Quest>
     <QRef>[12139/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have outlined to the House on several occasions recently, decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.</P>
    <P>The board is currently deciding on the disbursement of up to &euro;30 million. In that regard, the board has engaged Area Development Management Limited, or ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. The closing date for receipt of applications for this round of funding was 5 March 2004, and I understand approximately 1,500 applications had been <Col N="158"/>received by the closing deadline. The process of appraising and evaluating those applications by ADM is under way, and to date the board has approved 46 projects totalling approximately &euro;5 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided last December to make several changes regarding dormant accounts. Legislation to give effect to the proposed changes is currently being drafted and will be published in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the objectives of the disbursements scheme as set out in the board&rsquo;s first disbursement plan will remain unchanged, that is, funding to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons &mdash; those affected by economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage, and persons with a disability. It is also important to note that the Government decision provides that decisions in the area be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes key roles for the board, with particular regard to advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding and preparation of the disbursement plan.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the board will critically assess the additionality and impact of spending on a regular basis. That is of critical importance, and arrangements will be put in place to ensure that spending under the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board be kept separate from the normal Estimates process so that additionality can be verified.</P>
    <P>On the possible future role of ADM following the legislative changes proposed regarding dormant accounts, the Deputy will appreciate that arrangements for processing and so on have yet to be worked out. I point out, however, that arrangements to be put in place will have full regard to best practice in the disbursement of public moneys while seeking to avoid undue bureaucracy and excessive administrative and overhead costs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked whether the Minister would reconsider his decision to allow ADM to disburse the dormant accounts rather than set up a new board. The Minister did not address that. Does he not agree that ADM was set up by the EU to provide an independent conduit for funds to communities, voluntary bodies and others and that the critical aspect is that it is an independent body not influenced by political manoeuvring, not dependent on being in a Minister&rsquo;s constituency and not a slush fund?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree with the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, at the weekend when she said that politicians need to get back to the basic principles of honesty and integrity if people are not to become cynical about politics? Does the Minister acknowledge that it is cynical in the extreme that the Minister <Col N="159"/>for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said in 2001 that the dormant accounts fund would not be used as a slush fund, and yet two years later, that decision was rescinded, with the dormant accounts fund to be used as just that, out of the hands of independent bodies such as ADM?</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, about ADM, and his reply to me was that it was not right to detach taxpayers from their money. Does the Minister of State accept that, according to the Minister, it is not right to detach politicians from the disbursement of money? These funds are not tax raised by the Exchequer. This is money on which tax has already been paid, and such moneys should be disbursed by an independent body. I ask the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The board currently distributing the money is independent. ADM was hired by the board, since the latter was set up without staff, a structure, expertise or processing staff. In the short term, the board is therefore hiring ADM to carry out the job of evaluating and processing applications against certain criteria. In the future, that may continue. However, it is not a slush fund. Having examined what was set up, we feel that there are gaps and deficiencies in it.</P>

	<P>What are the deficiencies?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was set up as a board to distribute &euro;30 million a year with no structure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>ADM has a structure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not have a structure. The board is the legal authority and does not have its own staff. In the short term the board exists, with some seconded civil servants. Other people are being hired, namely ADM, to do a processing job for the board. It just proves the point that the board was set up without a staff or a structure. Giving it seconded staff from within the Civil Service works in the short term, but it is not a proper way to go about matters for the future. From the viewpoint of accountability, the part-time chairman is legally accountable and responsible for perhaps &euro;170 million. That is unsustainable. There were gaps in the way it was set up and we are trying to improve on and correct that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board set up? An independent body, ADM, already existed which, with a few extra seconded staff, could have carried out that function. In effect, what this means is that decisions in this matter will rest with the Minister. They will be political decisions and will not be taken by ADM. The body will appraise the projects etc. The Minister of State says it is accountable and transparent, but the decisions will ultimately be political. A body such as ADM was set up because the EU recommended the <Col N="160"/>need for an independent body. I have asked the Minister of State a question and still have not received an answer. What was the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> to change from ADM to the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board when a body was in place that could have done the job adequately?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has misunderstood. There is no reference to ADM in the legislation setting up the dormant accounts board. ADM&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Why set it up?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about the reason it was set up, it has nothing to do with the dormant accounts board. It was hired by the board on a short-term basis to do a job. ADM is not in charge of the dormant accounts fund.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>It should have been.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s view. I do not know that anyone else expressed that view when the legislation was going through the D&aacute;il a few years ago. She will have an opportunity to express it again when the legislation is brought forward in the coming weeks. We may be changing the dormant accounts board and its functions, but not ADM. The board could have employed anyone to do the temporary processing of the applications. It has employed ADM but that body is not part of the process. It is just being employed and paid in the short term to do a job.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>when the rural employment scheme announced by him on 3 December 2003 will be brought into place; if this scheme will be run separately from community employment schemes at local level and so have two different supervisors; if a farmer&rsquo;s child who is on disability, even though he or she may have no herd number of his or her own, will be eligible given that the district veterinary offices are reluctant to give second herd numbers; if this scheme will be up and running in the summer of 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[11714/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The rural social scheme aims to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities by harnessing the skills and talents available among low-income farmers and fishermen, and provide income support to low-income farmers and fishermen who are in receipt of specified, primarily long-term, social welfare payments. I envisage that the arrangements for the scheme will be put in place during the coming weeks. The scheme is distinct from the community employment scheme which aims to <Col N="161"/>provide training to allow participants re-enter the labour force. Both schemes can operate in the same area but with different management arrangements. Care will be taken at local level to ensure that there is no overlap or wasting of resources in a particular area.</P>
    <P>The scheme is aimed primarily at farmers who are in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, but the rules will admit low-income fishermen also. To be eligible to participate, an individual should be in receipt of farm assist, unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit if previously on community employment, or disability allowance and have a herd number.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that up to 2,500 places will be provided on the basis of the criteria outlined. A review of eligibility and impact of the scheme will be undertaken subsequent to its operation over 12 months having regard to demand and available resources and the question of possibly broadening the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>This scheme was announced on 3 December. It is now the end of April and the Minister says arrangements for the scheme will be put in place in the coming weeks. The reply is not that different from his reply to my previous question on this issue six weeks ago. Does the Minister accept that this scheme was thought of the day before the budget without any real research or planning being put into it? Does he accept that the fact it will be run in small local communities separately from the community employment scheme means that extra expense must be involved? Can it not be run under the same structures? Will there be funding for these workers to deliver jobs? I am told that, as yet, funding has not been suggested for the labour that will be undertaken. That is another major issue.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a pertinent question whether, in the light of difficulties with district veterinary officers, a son or daughter of a farmer, if he or she has a disability problem, would be able to avail of the scheme without a herd number. As the Minister knows, it is almost impossible now for a son or daughter to obtain a herd number.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise that to try to run the two schemes as one would be to have a trainee and work scheme under the one umbrella. They would not be compatible and therefore separate structures will be needed. We will try to co-ordinate them in such a way so that there is no unnecessary duplication. However, two different jobs are in hand.</P>
    <P>Funding is in place and I am ready to proceed. I can also confirm that I brought a memorandum to Government and that has been approved. It is fundamentally the same scheme as was prepared prior to the budget. Some technical difficulties had to be resolved and discussions have taken place in this regard. There have never been <Col N="162"/>problems with the structure of the scheme, but there were issues about who would carry out the recruitment tasks, pay the cheques every week etc., and responsibility at that level. I am in the final stages of determining those issues and am hopeful that the scheme can be up and running in three weeks.</P>
    <P>The final question is relevant, fair and good. I am aware of this difficulty. It does not apply only to people on disability allowance. For reasons to do with means testing, many older people have held on to ownership of the herd number. One will find a young person living on the farm &mdash; maybe not in the same house &mdash; who does much of the day-to-day farming. We all know the reasons for that. In the short term, the applicant or partner &mdash; the adult dependent on social welfare &mdash; will be the only eligible person. My philosophy is that if something is begun with tight criteria, it is much easier to loosen them if one finds they are too tight. If, however, one begins with wider criteria and loopholes present themselves, it is much more difficult to row back. I will keep in mind the issue raised by the Deputy. It is a valid one. A person in the circumstances he outlined would not be eligible. However, it would be possible in such circumstances because the one great reason for not transferring herd numbers from older to younger people &mdash; something we have encouraged for years &mdash; would be taken away. In such situations what can happen is that the herd number may be transferred from the older person to the younger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that only a small number of people are in this category. I make no apology for saying that. I have a particular case in mind where a young man has been on F&Aacute;S schemes but cannot be allowed to continue. He is not capable of working a 40-hour week and this type of scheme would be ideal for him. We should try to be cognisant of this type of situation.</P>
   <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>It is now nearly the end of April. Who will run this scheme? Who will pay the participants and will there have to be a hierarchy of personnel overseeing two or three people in a parish or whatever numbers are involved? We are tied down to the numbers on farm assist as being those who may enter the scheme. The number of parishes that may take it up is limited. Under community employment an overseer dealt with several different areas. How can we administrate this? It is necessary to have clear criteria because this has been happening since December.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in the final stages of sorting out who will pay. There were interdepartmental issues to be resolved and that has caused the delay. Anyone who has experience of the system understands that while one may know where one wants to go on a large scale, the detail always causes a delay. We are close to the end of the process and I hope we can get the scheme up and running very quickly.</P><Col N="163"/>
    <P>I would like to see parish schemes, whereby a parish and its organisation will come together and create a scheme which would provide a critical mass of applicants. There would be a supervisor for that group but some might maintain sports or community facilities, tidy towns, day care and so on. That has been a <i>de facto </i>pattern under the community employment scheme even if that was not intended in the beginning. It might have been intended under the SES which was a work scheme. To an extent we are returning to the point at which the Deputy started. The CE schemes were not aimed at progression but work. Farmers are not unemployed and under the law they do not have to be seeking a job to receive their payments. That has always been recognised but they are underemployed and underearning.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about time we did something for them and used the many skills they have to provide a service in the community to provide us with services, which they are begging to do. By coincidence, I received a letter from my parish outlining a problem similar to that which the Deputy raised. I have, however, only 2,500 places no matter how I approach this and would prefer to start with limited criteria, which I can extend, than start with possible loopholes. I would like to get the project up and running and then I will take on board Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s valid point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister say when this will start and who will run it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In two to three weeks I hope but there are some elements yet to put in place. We are considering the possibility of the Leader companies administering it at the intermediate layer because they cover all rural Ireland, unlike, for example, partnerships. My Department will carry the ultimate responsibility. There is a link with the Department of Social and Family Affairs because for the first time we are using the saving in social welfare as part of the funding for the scheme. That is a very rational and progressive step because it enables one Department to recognise the savings in another Department, from the taxpayers&rsquo; point of view.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the evidence of an increase in the prevalence of cocaine use, particularly through the local drugs task forces and the research done by the national advisory committee on drugs. Initial results from the 2002-03 drug prevalence survey of the overall national position, launched last October, showed that 3.1 % of the population between the ages of 15 and 64 have ever used cocaine, 1.1 % used it in the past 12 months and 0.3% used it in the past month. Results for the 15 to 34 year age group show slightly higher usage: 4.8% have ever used cocaine, 2% have used it in the past year and 0.7% reported usage in the past month. Compared with similar surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that use in Ireland is perhaps slightly above average.</P>
    <P>Bulletin 2 of the survey was launched last week and contains data for health board areas. The figures show that prevalence of all drugs varies considerably across the country, although there appears to be a higher prevalence in the east, particularly in the ERHA region. The numbers presenting for treatment of cocaine are, according to the most recent figures available, still very low and make up approximately 1% of the overall number of people in treatment. Garda authorities advise me that there are indications of an increase in the availability and use of cocaine. Offences involving cocaine, however, still represent a small proportion of the overall number of drug offences annually, approximately 5.5% of all such offences, according to the most recent Garda annual report.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>The increase in Ireland appears to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price. Through the implementation of the 100 actions in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the local drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in its area based on its identified priorities. These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including cocaine. We must be aware that most drug users engage in poly-drug use and projects should be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others. Since 1997 the Government has allocated or spent over &euro;65 million to implement the projects under the two rounds of task force plans.</P>
    <?oasys _xh?><P>Regional drug task forces have been established in each health board area. Where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in their forthcoming regional action plans. The Deputy will also be aware of the valuable preventative work being done through the young people&rsquo;s <Col N="165"/>facilities and services fund whose aim is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities, programmes and activities that will divert them away from the dangers of drug misuse.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
    <P el="0">Over &euro;72 million has been allocated under the fund to support in the region of 450 facility and services projects. It is vital that we continue to invest in facilities and services in areas worst affected by drugs if we are to stop the flow of young people into a life of addiction. There is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and I am advised that existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. In this context, it should be noted that the three area health boards of the ERHA have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years. I am keeping the matter of cocaine use under review.</P>
    <P el="0">Furthermore, the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in that context. In recent months I have visited several local drugs task force areas and discussed with community representatives and others the nature of the drug problem in their areas, including cocaine use. I have asked the national drugs strategy team to consider how best to develop proposals to help address this issue at local level.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State have any new ideas for dealing with this increasing widespread poly-drug use? The situation in Ringsend suggests that the drugs rehabilitation groups and other organisations need a major increase in funding. Many who experiment with drugs progress and leave them behind but those whom the drug culture captures need extra, sustained help to get out of the drug habit, to be rehabilitated and get opportunities for training or retraining to enable them to progress to full-time employment. Will the Minister of State say what action, if any, he proposes to take to reinforce those rehabilitation agencies?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Cocaine was always used by certain categories of people but it is cheaper now and is being used by a different group, including those in disadvantaged areas. Many of those using it are in treatment for heroin addiction or other problems. The Deputy was very involved in the strategy which runs from 2001 to 2008 and will undergo a half-term evaluation this year. An in-house team and a group from outside will study it later this year. The strategy concentrated on getting heroin misusers into treatment. The <Col N="166"/>number of those receiving methadone treatment exceeds the target set because communities cried out for substitute treatment. One hears fewer stories today about elderly people being mugged by people looking for their next fix. However, some of the 100 actions listed in the strategy have received more attention than others. The main drive has been to encourage people to take methadone. That scheme has been more or less ring-fenced, although there were objections from communities to it. There are a number of schemes.</P>
    <P>Are general rehabilitation schemes and drug-free programmes getting enough resources? With 7,000 people on methadone, that is the kind of issue under discussion at present. The mid-term review of the strategy will give us an opportunity to look at that. Everyone agreed that getting addicts onto methadone was the way to go. Now that we have got there, I accept there is some validity in the argument that we should be looking at other more long-term measures. While methadone works for some people, it is not a long-term solution. The mid-term review will allow us to look for a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Some 1,000 people remain on F&Aacute;S schemes. However, I accept we would benefit from more places. We get feedback on a continual basis from people but the mid-term review will provide a formal way to evaluate what we have done in recent years and examine if we should move in other directions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 101, 112, 120 and 147 together.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, decisions on disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. The board is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts.</P>
    <P>The board is currently deciding on the disbursement of funds up to &euro;30 million. In this regard, the board has engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. An invitation to organisations, groups, etc., to make applications for funding was advertised in the national press on Friday 21 November 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications for this round of funding was 5 March 2004.</P>
    <P>I understand approximately 1,500 applications were received and these have been evaluated. To date, the board has approved 46 projects totalling approximately &euro;5 million.</P>
    <P>Given that the dormant accounts fund spend is reckonable in the general government balance, it has been decided that spend on applications will generally be of the order of &euro;30 million per annum. In addition, as announced by the Minister for Finance in December 2003, a further &euro;10 million from the fund is being allocated in 2004 to the rural social scheme.</P>
    <P>Draft legislation to give effect to the proposed changes announced by the Government last December is currently being prepared and will be published in the next few weeks. The proposed changes were discussed by the disbursement board at its December 2003 meeting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the level of funding available, the first transfer of moneys from credit institutions to the dormant accounts fund, managed by the National Management Treasury Agency, took place at the end April 2003. The total involved was approximately &euro;196 million. Since then, some &euro;27.5 million has been reclaimed and &euro;3.5 million earned from investing the fund, leaving a current total of approximately &euro;172 million in the fund. This figure includes a reserve which must be maintained to meet claims for repayment and various costs associated with administering the scheme.</P>
    <P>A second transfer of funds from credit institutions together with the first transfer of moneys from life assurance policies will take place at the end of this month. I do not yet have an accurate estimate as to the likely yield from these sources.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister of State inquired of the insurance companies regarding the likelihood of the size of the donation coming from that quarter?</P><Col N="168"/>
    <P>At what time in the course of each year is it proposed to allocate the funds? Has a specified time been identified? Will it be at the end of the year or the beginning of the year?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated to the House the funds to date. Has he received any indicators as to the size of the funds likely to be available and how they will become available on an annual basis? That does not mean that the funding stops; it can continue indefinitely on an annual basis. Will he inform the House, in so far as accurate information is available, as to the precise calculations available in regard to both of these financial sectors?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Early indications from insurance companies is that we can expect in the region of &euro;40 million or &euro;45 million. However, early indications on dormant bank accounts also suggested a higher figure. The total may reduce somewhat as attempts are made by insurance companies to trace account holders.</P>
    <P>There is no specified time of the year for allocations to be made. Allocations for funding are considered at each board meeting. To date, &euro;5 million has been allocated. Applications are approved at each six-weekly meeting. The money may not have yet been paid out as legal agreements have to be entered into with successful applicants. A shortage of staff may also have led to delays.</P>
    <P>A small amount of money will come from dormant bank accounts and insurance policies on an ongoing basis each year. It will be a small trickle compared with the initial figures. There will be a far greater awareness as well as a far greater responsibility on the financial institutions and insurance companies to locate account holders and policyholders or their descendants. We will shortly see what additional moneys will come from financial institutions for the first year. I do not expect this sum to be large. We will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

	<P>Before Leaders&rsquo; Questions commence, I wish to make a brief statement concerning the current controversy surrounding a Circuit Court judge. The Chair recognises this matter raises issues of administration which are of public concern. I remind Members that, as this House may ultimately have to adjudicate on this matter under the law as it stands, in order to ensure the interests of the House are best protected, Members should refrain from making references which could prejudice the position of the House in the discharge of its obligation, if called upon to do so at a later stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will abide by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling on this matter, unlike some others I have heard.</P>
    <P>The events surrounding the recent trial of a Circuit Court judge have given rise to considerable public concern in two broad areas. The public cannot understand how what appears to be a very grave error has resulted in this trial ending in the way it did.</P>
    <P>Political responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government. It is to them that the people now look for answers. They want to know how such a basic and grave error could be made and who was responsible. They also want to know what were the roles of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in this matter. The second concern relates to the future of Judge Curtin and the possibility of his returning to the Bench.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach outline what action the Government has taken to deal with these two broad areas of fundamental concern?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the weekly meeting this morning the Government considered the circumstances of the collapse of the trial of Judge Brian Curtin in the Circuit Criminal Court last Friday. The House will be aware that the trial collapsed when the trial judge determined that the warrant issued for a search of the home of Judge Curtin was invalid and that, thus, evidence <Col N="170"/>of a search and of what was found in the search was inadmissible and could not go before the jury.</P>
    <P>Today, the Government decided to write to the Director of Public Prosecutions to request a report on the reasons the trial ended in this matter and also to ask the Garda Commissioner for a report. The Director of Public Prosecutions indicated he is prepared to give such a report.</P>
    <P>It is also recalled that on 20 May 2002 Judge Peter Smithwick, President of the District Court, on an application from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, issued a search warrant for a search of the residence of Judge Brian Curtin. The underlying factual basis for that application for a search warrant and for the preferring of charges was not heard in evidence. Judge Curtin did not give or adduce evidence on his own behalf in response to the charges preferred against him because of the course of that trial pursued.</P>
    <P>In these special circumstances and bearing in mind the seriousness of the charges against him, the Government decided to write to Judge Curtin to seek an explanation from him of the circumstances of his apparent access to a website and downloading of child pornography images from same. This request of Judge Curtin is with a view to shortly making a fair and objective assessment as to whether grounds exist for a motion for removal of the judge from office for stated misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>As this matter will come before the House, I have to practice caution and urge caution on the part of Members of this House as to what is said. This is an extremely serious matter. It is of profound constitutional importance. Confidence in the Judiciary is of vital importance to a democracy. The maintenance of that confidence in the integrity of the Judiciary means that, in accordance with our constitutional provisions, the Houses of the Oireachtas can, where there is stated misbehaviour, remove a judge from office. That is a decision the House could have to address in the near future. If there are grounds of stated misbehaviour, removal from office is the only option. There are no alternatives. Moreover, monetary compensation simply does not arise. There is no provision for this and no justification for it on such removal.</P>
    <P>The factual information sought from Judge Brian Curtin is to be furnished not later than 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 4 May. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that this issue is resolved one way or the other within a short space of time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to restore the damage caused to public confidence as a result of this event, clear and transparent answers must be given. In similar circumstances in other jurisdictions heads would roll and resignations would follow. In that context, will the Taoiseach undertake to publish the reports he will receive from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda Commissioner? Failure to publish them will result in only further public dismay.</P><Col N="171"/>
    <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House, if prior to his appointment, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board or any member of Government, was aware of any concerns about Brian Curtin&rsquo;s behaviour, conduct or activities, which would give rise to concerns about his suitability for appointment in the first instance?</P>
    <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government have not yet delivered on a commitment in the programme for Government to legislate for the misbehaviour of members of the Judiciary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have to take advice with regard to the DPP&rsquo;s report &mdash; the DPP is independent of this House &mdash; and the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s report. Whatever about publishing the full reports, I think it would be best if the substance of what they state was made public. If the House has to deal with this issue in any case, it must have the facts. In so far as I can publish them or make their contents known in some form, I will certainly do that.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, the answer is not to my knowledge. I do not think any matters regarding Brian Curtin were relayed, certainly to the best of my knowledge. I would have to do a detailed check to answer that question fully.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s third question, as he knows, there was a Bill some years ago that should have brought about a constitutional change but that did not happen. I think it was subsequently proved that perhaps all that is required to deal with the matter is the introduction of legislation or a change to Standing Orders. That matter is still under examination and work is in preparation on it in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not think there is a difficulty in dealing with the matter raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s third question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, will observe the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s request for restraint, but I would like to record that it ought to apply universally, which has not been the case to date and certainly was not the case when roles were reversed in this House. I remember times when a letter going missing was enough to send the Opposition spokesman for justice at the time on a rampage that would have made Richard Harris&rsquo;s role in &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; look understated. That was a habitual performance at the time. However, now we are all to be restrained and to put a great deal of clear water between the Government and an event that has caused a collapse in public confidence along the lines suggested by Deputy Kenny.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to the question about whether any reservations had been expressed at the time of the appointment of this particular member of the Bench. I did not <Col N="172"/>hear him comment on that. I did not hear him say whether the then Minister for Justice had any role in advancing his preferment at that time. I did not hear the Taoiseach say whether he is happy with the procedures in place for the appointment of members of the Judiciary. Most particularly of all, I have not heard the Taoiseach say why the judicial conduct and ethics Bill, promised in the programme for Government in 2002, promised for publication again in 2003 and now promised for publication in 2004, has not been before the House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not have any difficulty in devoting most of the time of the House in the past six weeks to a measure on electronic voting, the urgency of which escapes me. He now has managed to tie up the time of the House all this week on a Bill on citizenship, purely for short-term advantage. How come time can be made available in the House for these matters and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, can find time to bring forward legislation on these matters but not on a matter such as judicial misconduct, of which this House has been seized previously? What are the priorities here? I would be obliged if the Taoiseach could answer those questions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer the Deputy did not hear me give to a question asked by Deputy Kenny was that I was not aware of any issue around Mr. Curtin before he was appointed. I would have to do an in-depth check to find out if there was any, but I think that would have been noticed or seen. I do not have any doubts about the existing procedures. Like any procedures, it is hard to detect everything but we have substantially changed the process of the appointment of members of the Judiciary. In the normal course of events, it seems to work very well, as it is only on a very rare occasion that any difficulties whatsoever arise. This type of situation rarely arises.</P>
    <P>I have already said the legislation that will be necessary or the necessary changes to Standing Orders in terms of a requirement of that earlier Bill are being dealt with in the Department Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I could say to the Deputy that if we had agreed the amending legislation a few years ago, we could have dispensed with this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this my fault too?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Deputy was not involved in it at the time, as he will recall. We could have dealt with it at that stage. It is an outstanding issue. The Bill is still in existence but if the matter can be dealt with under Standing Orders it may not be necessary. That is a matter to which we will return. If it is necessary, we would have to enact it. I am advised it may not be and that a change in Standing Orders may suffice.</P>
    <P>We have many arguments about the handling of various events by the Judiciary. I contend this is a separate and serious matter which does not <Col N="173"/>involve, as in some instances I recall, an argument about a file or a letter. The Ceann Comhairle made the point that the House would be the arbitrator of justice, which, thankfully, does not happen in respect of many cases. That is why this is different to other matters.</P>
    <P>The procedure the House would have to adopt and follow on this matter has been outlined to me. However, we must ensure there is due process, fairness and equity in anything we do. That is why we are proceeding on the basis I outlined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that this is a very serious matter and does not involve a file or a letter going missing. That is the point I was making. I merely commented that I have seen the House in uproar about a letter going missing. I hope the Taoiseach appreciates that we are not adopting a similarly opportunistic role in this instance.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach saying he now believes that the judicial conduct and ethics Bill is not necessary and that a mere change in Standing Orders will suffice? Is he saying this matter will or is likely to come before the House? Why did the Taoiseach explicitly state there will be no monetary compensation? I am surprised he was so absolute about that matter. Is he saying that if an offer of resignation is made, there would be no question of compensation being paid for loss of office?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the point about the judicial conduct and ethics Bill? My understanding was that the combination of parties which have been in Government since 1997 were sufficiently persuaded in 2001 to include the Bill in the programme for Government and to pledge its introduction in the most recent schedule of legislation published.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill was to provide for effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour, including lay participation in the investigation of complaints. It arose on foot of discussions we had in 2001. I have stated on the record previously that the Department was considering the provisions that might be included in the Bill, taking into account work done by the Constitution Review Group, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution and the Chief Justice&rsquo;s committee on judicial ethics. In some of those discussions it was stated that legislative measures might not perhaps be necessary. I am not stating this is definitely the case but it was pointed out that the matter might be dealt with by a change in Standing Orders. As the Deputy is aware, the difficulty in 2001 was that there was no right of reply and people could not be represented. That matter must be dealt with and the House must decide on the procedures to be followed in the event of this happening. Under Article 35.4.1&deg;, a motion for impeachment would ultimately come before the House.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="174"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I must confess I do not have a clue what that means.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain what it means. If the House were to deal with a case of impeachment, it would be obliged to decide on the procedures to be followed. It may not require legislation to do so, the House might be required to agree the procedure and to deal with the matter by Standing Order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In entirely accept that. The question I asked was whether the Bill was still going to be advanced?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is still being advanced. It was proposed, in what was the then Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, that provision would be made by law for the establishment of a body to investigate, or cause to be investigated, whether persons, while holding the office of judge, engaged in conduct constituting misbehaviour or were affected by incapacity and to make and publish findings and recommendations. Those heads were set out at the time in legislation. That Bill was published in 2001. However, since then we have taken account of some other matters, namely, the reports of the Constitution Review Group, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution and the Chief Justice&rsquo;s committee on judicial ethics. If it is required, that legislation, updated with the findings and recommendations of those three reports, will be introduced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue have a role in the preferment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s final question related to compensation. What I stated earlier is the Government&rsquo;s view on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to observe the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling. I will, therefore, deal with a matter which may involve recognition of court proceedings but it is a separate matter from that raised by Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>A columnist in <i>The Irish Times</i> today described the lack of compliance with planning law in Ireland as a sick joke. This observation follows last Monday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, comments by the Ombudsman today about the reluctance of local authorities to pursue infringements of planning law &mdash; I cite, in particular, illegal dumping &mdash; the lack of action when I brought to the House&rsquo;s attention allegations of a bribe of &euro;50,000 being made in respect of a proposal for a dump in east Galway and the lack of action in respect of the illegal shipping of waste by local authorities to the Far East via Belgium. An article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> recently referred to the fact that a waste company will, in Wicklow Circuit Court this summer, face charges of allegedly dumping without a licence in ways which caused damage to the environment. This company was partly <Col N="175"/>responsible for allegedly creating the largest illegal dump to be discovered in this country to date. The article went on to state that a key defendant in the case has made a donation to Fianna F&aacute;il for &euro;6,000 in the form of a cheque.</P>
    <P>If we are to be genuine in discussing standards in public office in the House, will the Taoiseach indicate whether it is Fianna F&aacute;il policy to accept donations from generous people who are before the courts? Is it the case that it would be unthinkable to accept a donation such as that to which I refer and that Fianna F&aacute;il should return the cheque forthwith, pending the outcome of the court case?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government put in place the Office of Environmental Enforcement to enhance environmental compliance through the enforcement of EPA licences and by an enhanced supervisory role in respect of local authorities. That work is legislated for and is focused heavily on the area of waste.</P>
    <P>We provided substantial resources to both the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities to enforce it. The legislation, powers and enforcement are in place and the Government position is that it should be enforced without fear or favour to any individual, company or issue. I have no information on individual donations and am not answerable to the House on that. The legislation and the EPA&rsquo;s powers and controls should be fully implemented.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>With the greatest respect, I did not ask the Taoiseach about the legislation. I asked whether it is appropriate for Fianna F&aacute;il to receive a donation made by somebody who is before the courts, particularly given that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is amending legislation and policy to lift restrictions on people operating dumps to accept waste from within their own regions? Is it not the case that, unless this cheque for &euro;6,000 is returned, not only is Fianna F&aacute;il accused of taking money from somebody who is seeking to lessen the legal punishment, it can also be accused of suiting the policy it is putting in place to the large waste hauliers who will obviously benefit from the relaxation of guidelines restricting dumps to accepting waste within their areas? Is it not also the case that this is not a matter for the EPA or anybody else but for the Taoiseach to set a standard and to state whether it is acceptable for Fianna F&aacute;il to accept &euro;6,000 from somebody before the courts over infringement of planning and illegal dumping?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered the Deputy already. I have no details on the issue of who got subscriptions from what for any party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach could obtain them easily enough.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="176"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither am I answerable in the House for Fianna F&aacute;il. I have no information on the matter so I cannot give an answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not want to know.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is stringent legislation. I do not think it is true, as the Deputy may be implying, that the Minister is easing or amending legislation to suit somebody. No Government would do that. We have tough laws and powers to strengthen the legislation and we are doing that. Deputy Sargent must acknowledge that the reason some of those dumps existed was because we had hardly any laws, no regulations and no enforceability. We now have the EPA, tough laws and the resources, and that is why the issues are being dealt with.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>

How it is expected to take on board the careful scrutiny of all of these proposals is beyond me. Regarding No. 10, motion re the proposed EU Refugee Fund, it will not only be used for the reception and integration of asylum seekers but will also be used to facilitate returns. I understand that the European Council on Refugees and Exiles has argued that these funds should not be used for the return of rejected asylum applicants but should be used only in the cases of those who were granted refugee status or other complementary protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>We welcome the motion set out in No. 12 in the context of improved trade agreements and co-operation with the central American and Andean states. Nevertheless, there needs to be awareness of two at least of the clauses within that, namely, Article 50 and Article 49 regarding counter-terrorism and the re-admission clauses in Article 49. I bring these to the attention of Members because they apply in what can only be regarded as countries with notorious human rights records, including Colombia, Guatemala and El Salvador. We need to have careful scrutiny of it.</P>

	<P>It is striking that the disability Bill, which has been on previous programmes of legislation, is appearing yet again with another deadline for the summer recess even though it was to have been Easter. Its publication is always imminent. Is the Government taking people to be fools when it claims it is almost published but never is? Will it be published before the next election and will it be rights-based?</P>
    <P>The charities regulation Bill is one of those perennials that has been on the go since 1980. It was expected in 2004 but now it will celebrate its 25th anniversary on the legislation programme in 2005. It is incredible that legalisation is promised but never appears.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on the legislation? He cannot make a statement on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Public consultations on the charities regulation Bill were formally launched on 16 February, with the deadline for responses set for 28 May. The outcome of these consultations will be published and it will also inform preparations of the draft legislation. The heads of the Bill are expected at the end of 2004, with the legislation to be published next year.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to complete work on the disability Bill. However, its framework and sectoral plans and the comhairle Bill had to be taken into account. Work has been completed on the comhairle Bill while most of the sectoral plans are completed. The Government, through consultations, is endeavouring to improve the Bill&rsquo;s presentation and address some of the issues in the sectoral plans. Most of the work on the heads is completed and, after further meetings last week, it is hoped to finish it quickly. The Bill is a difficult one and we are seeking as much agreement as possible with all interested groups to avoid future unnecessary arguments.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Ministers often claim that tackling the infrastructural deficit is their high priority. In the programme for legislation there are now 107 Bills due before the House along with 30 already published. In section C there is the strategic national infrastructure Bill due to be published as a matter of urgency in 2005. There is also the national roads infrastructural Bill due to be published later this year, along with the critical infrastructure (Dublin metro) Bill. Is there any possibility that the Government will get its act together and publish them all as one? It does not make sense that there are three separate Bills concerning infrastructure in what is already a highly crowded legislative programme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Each of the necessary three Bills referred to is at a different stage. One is before the Government while the other two are in preparation. Is the Deputy proposing that they be merged?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>One Bill concerns the proposed metro and is not related to any other issue. The national infrastructure Bill will legislate to try to introduce certainty in fast-tracking other proposals.</P>

	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the programme for legislation, 19 Bills are listed for publication before the summer recess? However, according to the January programme, 13 of those were to have been published before Easter. The January programme stated that the health Bill for establishing the new health service executive and providing a legal framework for a complaints procedure in the health service was expected to be published in 2004. The Minister for Health and Children is introducing a Bill to abolish the direct representation of local authority members to the health boards on Thursday.

The register for persons considered unsafe to work with children Bill has been listed in section C for a year. When is it expected that it will come before the House? The Bill arises out of the North-South Ministerial Council. Why is this Bill delayed when corresponding comprehensive legislation is already in place in Northern Ireland?</P>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science is anxious to complete the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill and will be ready to proceed with Report Stage in the next few weeks. With regard to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill, the Department is now considering the Ryan report and is in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. It is hoped to proceed with this Bill later in the year. I do not have a date for the register for persons considered unsafe to work with children Bill. A cross-departmental working group was established to consider proposals for reforming the vetting procedures of the Garda. The final meeting of that group has taken place and the report is to be presented to the Garda Commissioner in the near future. Publication is dependent upon the working group&rsquo;s recommendations so I do not have a date for that.</P>

	<P>The whole country is aware of the women who suffered terrible and barbaric injury at the hands of Dr. Neary in the North Eastern Health Board area. Is the Taoiseach not dismayed at the fact that although it was promised there would be no undue delay in the publication of the medical practitioners Bill at the time when the Medical Council released its findings about Dr. Neary, the most recent publication of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme now states that it is not possible to <Col N="186"/>indicate when publication will take place? It appears we are going backwards. Is the Taoiseach not worried about this? Will we have to wait for a Dr. Shipman before this Bill is published?</P>

In light of the rush for the Minister to publish the referendum Bill, when will we see publication of this Bill? We now have a chaotic approach to immigration. This Bill must be brought in as soon as possible to avoid chaos.</P>
    <P>The national monuments (amendment) Bill is to deal with the issues raised by the decision of the High Court on Carrickmines. Further in the Government&rsquo;s legislation programme, we see mention of another Bill, the national monuments Bill, which is to consolidate and modernise five key items of national monuments legislation. Can we not deal with both issues together in a single Bill covering all national monuments, whether at Carrickmines or the Hill of Tara?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The national monuments (amendment) Bill, which will deal with the Carrickmines judgment, will be taken this session. It is an urgent Bill to deal with a problem that is costing the State substantial amounts at present.</P>

	<P>The national monuments Bill, which is to consolidate and modernise the five key items of national monuments legislation, will be published next year. Work on the heads of the immigration and residence Bill is ongoing but, as I said previously, the Bill was delayed by work on other matters of immigration legislation, including the consideration of submissions received as part of the public consultation process on immigration and the International Organisation for Migration study on migration legislation practice.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach, in reply to an earlier question from Deputy Enright, said that the commission to inquire into child abuse (amendment) Bill would not be introduced until much later. Is legislation planned to amend the Residential Institutions Redress Act, given that the matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte is only one of a number arising out of the chaos into which that Act has now been plunged? People are also experiencing difficulty in accessing the High Court. Will there be legislation to amend the Act to remove the anomalies that are now arising? Will there be legislation to enable the High Court to be accessed? Will the legislation on the <Col N="187"/>commission be expanded to take account of these matters?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legislation listed to amend the Residential Institutions Redress Act. As I have said, Mr. Ryan&rsquo;s report is being examined with a view to introducing legislation on the other side.</P>

	<P>We have been trying to assist the man for the past four or five days. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte. We endeavoured last week to speak to him and a number of colleagues succeeded. We have contacts with some members of his family. The official who is dealing with these cases is best positioned to explain the difficulties of his case to him and has done so. Deputies are aware of the substance of the case. A number of people have assisted with this matter today and talked to the man but to no avail. He is weakening. Perhaps we could all try to convince him to give up his hunger strike. It is a difficult case. A senior church figure will talk to him later this evening. We have explained the facts to him but the matter cannot be addressed. We will do everything we can. I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and I hope everyone can help in trying to get through to him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the Residential Institutions Redress Act. The Minister should consider the anomaly that has been created in the case of the man outside the gate and a number of other cases &mdash; he is not alone. A gentleman found that his award was reduced substantially because he sought a hearing when he was presenting his case. This is the result of an anomaly. The Act should be revisited to address that.</P>
    <P>My second question is about an item that is due to be published before the summer recess. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already closed three prisons and he now proposes to introduce a prisons Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I have. It is about the Minister&rsquo;s legislative proposal to close a fourth prison, namely, Mountjoy Prison. Will the Taoiseach tell us why there is need for legislation? When will the Minister stop closing prisons?</P>
    <P>The judicial conduct and ethics Bill was referred to earlier. Arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks, can we take it that although it will not be published in this session, it will now be fast-tracked because of the urgency of the situation?</P>

Four of these Bills are under section B of the programme, meaning the heads have been agreed but the legislation has not yet been drafted, and 21 are under section C, meaning the heads have yet to be approved. Given that the Minister has the capacity to produce legislation out of a hat, as he has with the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004, would it be in order to suggest to the Minister that he produce the Bills that have been promised and not introduce any more new legislation? The 21 promised Bills have been included in the last three legislation programmes but we have not seen a word of them.</P>

	<P>The Minister is not proceeding with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill 2002 and that is why it has not been moved.

   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputy Costello. Amendment No. 2 is related, therefore, it is proposed to discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together, by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Save where the application relates to a proposal by a tribunal to exercise a function without notice to any person, being a function that may lawfully and properly be exercised in that manner, a tribunal shall give notice of a proposed application under this section to any person likely to be affected thereby.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">My first amendment relates to section 3. I want clarification of those who will be affected by the <Col N="197"/>action that is proposed. Section 3 makes provision for a tribunal or the chairman of a tribunal to apply to the High Court in respect of any matter relating to the performance of the functions of the tribunal or the chairman, and that includes costs. My amendment refers to the effect of that application on other people because if it involves the performance of some of the functions of the tribunal or the chairman, it is relevant to somebody who is before the tribunal. In respect of costs, for example, that might be a very relevant matter where somebody might be affected by the outcome.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to make provision for notice to be given of such a proposed application and the opportunity for somebody to have audience in the High Court as to the reason the performance in the manner that is presented might not take place. In the context of natural justice, if there is an application to the High Court it should not be <i>ex parte</i> but should follow some opportunity or notice granted to the person who will be affected by it. That is a reasonable point of view.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is a continuation of that in many ways because it arises out of the application to the High Court. The High Court may grant directions or give orders and I want to ensure that if such orders are given those orders would be binding not just on the tribunal but on the people who will be affected by the decision of the High Court to grant an application, and to clarify the distinction between directions and orders. These two amendments would go some distance towards improving the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments are opposed. Amendment No. 1 proposed by the Deputy would provide for the insertion of a new subsection (2) to section 3 to the effect that a tribunal shall give notice of a proposed application to seek the directions of the High Court to any person likely to be affected thereby. We should be clear that, unlike in a civil or criminal case, in a tribunal the parties are not definite at all the stages of the process. However, tribunals are required to observe natural justice in their actions.</P>
    <P>This amendment, if it were accepted, would impose an impossible burden on the chairperson of a tribunal seeking to exercise the power provided by section 3. The chairperson would have to identify any person likely to be affected in any particular circumstances giving rise to the application. This would lead to a logistical nightmare being imposed on the tribunal in attempting to contact such persons or classes of persons. I can think of no similar requirement in any comparable situation.</P>
    <P>In any event, power is given to the High Court under section 4(<i>a</i>)(2) upon application from the tribunal to give such directions and make such orders as is considered appropriate. On first hearing the application, the High Court can make an order, if necessary, directing that the motion <Col N="198"/>be served on specified parties or classes of parties. This is a more pragmatic approach than placing the burden initially on the tribunal to make a decision to identify the parties or classes of parties who might be affected by the application. The High Court would be in a better position after a preliminary hearing of the application to make an order directing that the motion be served on a particular party, if necessary adjourning the application, if appropriate, to hear submissions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 to section 3 as proposed by the Deputy would introduce an explicit provision that directions, once received from the High Court, would be binding on the tribunal or on any person concerned. I do not accept that we require such an amendment. If a tribunal seeks directions of the High Court, it is implicit upon receiving the directions that it will comply with them. Non-compliance with the court&rsquo;s direction by a tribunal which has sought the directions in the first place would be an outlandish scenario which no doubt would be amenable to judicial review by affected third parties in any event. I should mention that the Attorney General concurs with these views on both the proposed amendments. Accordingly, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to section 3 are opposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to argue the point further because the matter came up at an earlier stage. In the event of the chairman of the tribunal seeking an order in regard to costs from the High Court, can the Minister of State give us some idea of how that order might be sought? What application would that entail? Would it be in respect of costs of specific individuals or certain modules? Perhaps it relates to an individual.</P>
   <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>We all know of the enormous legal costs associated with tribunals. Many of us heard Mr. Justice Flood talking about his time on the tribunal on the Marion Finucane show this morning and how he believed that its lawyers were not that well paid. For the rest of us in the real world, such fees are astronomical. I would have thought that, in such a matter, where an application is made by the chairman of the tribunal to the High Court regarding how costs are to be assessed and allocated, it would be appropriate that a person affected have the opportunity of some sort of audience or at least notice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are actions and issues for the chairman of the tribunal, and we should not anticipate what he will do in such a situation. As an independent person, it is his own business and entitlement to decide how to apply for costs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is how the person would be affected by the application, since he or she would seek direction from the High Court. He would make application to it, and it would hear the application only from the tribunal chairperson. Given the implications and effect <Col N="199"/>that it might have on various other persons who might be affected by having to pay astronomical sums, it seems appropriate that, if individuals are identified, they have some right of audience or at least have notice that such an application is going to the High Court. What does the Minister of State have to say on that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State made a response that he should perhaps amend. He said that the chairperson of the tribunal could effectively do what he or she liked. I do not think that he meant to say that. The chairperson of the tribunal would be expected to act entirely within the law. We are facilitating the tribunal chairmen by this additional Bill and making the law clearer for them. The Minister may wish to clarify what he said earlier.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Paragraph 14(1) of Schedule 2 lists the decision of the authority which may be appealed to the appeal board. This amendment is essentially a drafting amendment designed to clarify the content and improve the presentation of paragraph 14(1).</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In the process, however, it deletes lines 17 to 19. Does that not have a knock-on effect on section 39? In the first instance, it is not simply an addition of paragraph (<i>c</i>) but a deletion of lines 17 to 19. It seems to delete any complaints made under section 39 and as there is a raft of complaint procedures under section 39 it does not appear to be just a tidying up amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is merely presentational in that it removes some previous texts and sets out more clearly the provisions in terms of (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>).</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State saying that the phrase &ldquo;issuing a reprimand, warning or caution or an advice&rdquo; tidies up all the complaints <Col N="201"/>against licensees in section 39, which gives a whole list relating to revocation, suspension, reprimand, warning, caution and advice. They are all gone now and the wording has been reduced to reprimand, warning or caution, or an advice. Revocation and suspension have been deleted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) refers to a person aggrieved by a decision of the authority, in the new text, refusing to grant a licence; (<i>b</i>) refers to suspending or revoking a licence; (<i>c</i>) refers to issuing a reprimand, warning or caution or an advice; (<i>d</i>) refers to refusing a variation of the kind or kinds of security services to which a licence relates; and (<i>e</i>) is not to uphold a complaint under section 39.</P>

  <P>Seanad amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Seanad amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 46, lines 39 and 40, to delete paragraph 21(6)(<i>c</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) (i) where the request is by the Authority, shall be made within the period of one month referred to in <i>paragraph 17(1),</i> or</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(ii) where the request is by the person referred to in <i>paragraph 18(1)</i> as the &lsquo;other person&rsquo;, shall be made within one month of the notice of appeal being received by that person.&rdquo;.</P>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I would like to query the additional paragraph being inserted here &mdash; the second paragraph, if one looks at the legislation.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is also a technical amendment. It arises from an amendment made in this House on Report Stage.

    <P FLI="0" LI="2">&ldquo;and not less than three of the persons appointed having knowledge or experience of organic production methods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It is necessary in present circumstances to have people who have experience of organic <Col N="203"/>production methods, particularly as there is a major debate in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 15 is logical. In any board or organisation set up by the State there should, at least, be an instruction to say that those being appointed possess a knowledge of the subject matter that will come before them. I regret that up to now, during my time in the D&aacute;il, such amendments have not been taken on board. If they had been we would know about such boards: their members would at least be capable of some regard for the subject matter in hand and have the requisite expertise or knowledge to ensure that the whole aspect of food production was properly reviewed. It is important on issues such as this that the Government at least takes a step. It is not that every single member of a board has to have the knowledge. In this case we are only asking that not fewer than three persons have the knowledge or experience in organic production methods. In amendment No. 16 it is stipulated that they should be &ldquo;familiar&rdquo;, which means that they might have done some reading on aspects of genetic modification.</P>
    <P>This is an important debate which will continue far into the future, as it has lasted a long time in other jurisdictions. We must be confident that board members have the expertise to make informed decisions after proper discussion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree on the importance of having knowledge or experience of organic production methods, and that members of the board be familiar with the debate on genetic modification. The Fischler proposals will effect a sea-change in Irish agriculture and while it may happen gradually at first we must look to the promotion and development of organic production methodologies and increase the input and expertise on this. It would be remiss not to provide in the Act that any person dealing with horticulture or any aspect of agriculture would have a knowledge of organic production methods.</P>
    <P>The amendment is mild in that it asks only that the members be familiar with the debate on genetic modification. This House has not paid sufficient attention to genetically modified foods. There has been no public consultation on many of the developments in this area and no detailed consultation with the interested parties. It is important for the future of Irish agriculture that there are people on the board who know about genetic modification. The impact of multinationals on our industry poses a serious risk and is a cause for concern. We must know the arguments and be able to debate this and defend our position on genetically modified foods.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Knowledge or experience of the horticultural sector encompasses knowledge or experience of organic production and familiarity <Col N="204"/>with current issues. Membership of the proposed sub-board, at 12 ordinary members, is two more than the complement of members on the national board of Bord Glas, and the chairperson, who would be a member of the main board, will be statutorily required to have knowledge or experience of the horticultural sector. The person cannot be appointed without that knowledge. The proposed amendments are superfluous given the all-embracing definition of horticulture in the Bill and the specific reference to these issues would undermine and cause confusion about the present definition.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there is a good mix of professions, industry and sectoral experience, commercial expertise, and that it would be possible to have a powerful body of professional capacity and experience on the board to ensure that we can continue to drive the sector forward. If we are too prescriptive in the legislation about the appointments we will remove the flexibility that is crucial to ensure that there is a mix on the board that will serve to drive the industry forward. Consequently I regret that I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Knowledge of horticulture does not confirm knowledge of organic or genetically modified production. They are very different subjects. Organic farming is a specialised area. I come from a farming background and most of those I know involved in horticulture and the farm industry do not have a deep knowledge of organic farming. Those who know most about it are in their 70s and 80s because effectively the type of production they engaged in was organic. Genetic modification is in its infancy and someone involved in horticulture would not necessarily know about it. The debate is starting to develop throughout Europe. Last Monday there was a conference here involving people from Wales and France and a leading member of the IFA, all of whom have serious concerns about this. To appoint a board which does not include people with an intimate knowledge of the topic from the scientific and production points of view is reckless, to say the least. That is why I propose these amendments.</P>

I do not know how we would ever appoint boards or achieve conclusions if we were to ask candidates to go to the personal expense of entering a competition, and ask someone to decide on behalf of the State who should sit on the boards. This is a broad policy issue and would entail a major change in the ethos of public service appointments. There is respect for people with track records of success in various disciplines, professions and industries who are asked to give of their expertise, for nothing, to help develop the economy in various sectors.</P>
    <P>In order to have a serious debate on this issue, a special Bill would have to be sponsored by the Department of Finance because competition is in the remit of the public service. It would not be advisable to do so in the context of a Bill, the purpose of which is to amalgamate two State bodies. To do so would mean a change in policy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> public sector appointments, which would be a distortion of the <i>status quo </i>without having examined the overall policy impact it would have in terms of the macro appointments that would be made across a range of State boards. On that basis, this is not the appropriate place for introducing a major change in the general policy for the filling of vacancies in State boards and sub-boards, which in some cases would override the nominating function of producer and consumer interests.</P>
    <P>Various organisations have a nominating function to most State bodies. It would not be up to the State, Ministers or Departments to dictate to these bodies whom they should appoint. That would be unfair. It would also be an infringement of the democratic rights of these organisations to appoint people according to existing structures and based on legislation that has been passed over the years. It would not be an appropriate place to make this significant policy change, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>Serious ramifications would result from what is proposed in the amendment. A successful structure has evolved whereby, depending on the size and role of the board, membership is staggered on the basis of a set number of years, for example, one, three or five years. This is in order to maintain continuity in a board&rsquo;s performance and to retain experience, expertise and leadership within the board from one period to another. Section 19 has been deliberately phrased to ensure continuity in subsidiary board membership on a rolling basis. The three-year term for subsequent appointees is a normal tenure of office for such boards. Accordingly, some members will be in place for a shorter term than others. New members will come in and some existing members will continue until their term is up and so on. On that basis, one will get a mix of expertise and periods of time spent on the board which maintains continuity in the commitment, leadership and totality of abilities that are critical to the success of a board to deliver. On that basis, it would not be good policy to legislate to the effect that an entire board would be put out of office and to have it totally replaced. It would not be in the best interests of any sector or any board. I urge the Deputy to reconsider the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 10, lines 11 and 12, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;have&rdquo; in line 11 down to and including &ldquo;balance&rdquo; in line 12 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P FLI="0" LI="2">&ldquo;comply with the requirement to ensure that not less than 40 per cent of the members of such Board are men and not less than 40 per cent are women&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We discussed the amendment in some detail on Committee Stage. The Bill, as set out, indicates that the board &ldquo;shall have regard to the desirability of achieving an appropriate gender balance.&rdquo; That is inadequate. The decision of the House is that the gender balance on State boards would consist of at least 40% men and 40% women. I am especially concerned about boards within the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food, which falls far down the <Col N="207"/>league table in terms of meeting that gender balance. For that reason, I propose that we amend the Bill by specifying a 40% gender balance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Upton&rsquo;s amendment differs from amendment No. 22 in my name to the extent that my amendment proposed a 50% gender balance. However, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment in support of amendment No. 21. It would be a powerful statement from the body politic in recognition of the enormous role played by women in agriculture and rural Ireland. I fully support Deputy Upton&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Deputy Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any difficulty with the need for an appropriate gender balance on this subsidiary board. The same is true of the Minister and the Government. That is why subsection (9) is worded in the way it is. It imposes a statutory duty on the main board to seek to achieve gender balance in its appointments to the subsidiary board. This is an obligation which the main board may not ignore, as Government policy &mdash; to which Deputy Upton has alluded &mdash; is clear in this regard. Nominating bodies can be asked to reflect on their nominations so as to achieve gender balance in light of prevailing Government policy.</P>
    <P>In response to the comments of Deputy Upton <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the farming organisations and other bodies, the Minister and the Department work closely with farming bodies to ensure that we create a much greater opportunity for women within these organisations so as to make them available for appointment to State boards. Deputies can rest assured of our ongoing commitment to this end.</P>
    <P>A commitment also exists to achieve an increase in the participation of women. The main board has been asked to reflect on Government policy in regard to its nominations. In the event that the board should fail in its duty, the legislation allows the Minister of the day to withhold consent to nominations for appointment to the horticulture subsidiary board in the absence of an appropriate gender balance.</P>
    <P>The subsection, as drafted, has a two-tier approach that ensures a double-check on the requirement, to achieve gender balance on the subsidiary board and also to allow the Minister to intervene if he is not satisfied with the nominations put forward. The wording is deliberate in its aim to achieve the desired result. It is a positive aspect of the legislation and it would be unwise to make any amendment to it. I regret I cannot accept the proposed changes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State confirm that &ldquo;an appropriate gender balance&rdquo;, means 40%? This type of wording has provided a let-off for many State boards where gender balance has not been achieved. The Government <Col N="208"/>decision on gender balance is specified as a minimum membership of 40% of either gender. Many State boards have not achieved this and we should not allow them a soft option to the effect that a board &ldquo;shall have regard to the desirability of achieving an appropriate gender balance.&rdquo; The statement needs to be much stronger. The 40% requirement must be written into the legislation. Many State boards have failed miserably in this regard. I recall the debates in regard to some of the banking organisations in which we were told there was an insufficiency of suitably qualified women.</P>
    <P>When we talk about gender balance, we should be clear that there is only one State board on which there is a majority or more than the required 40% of women serving. We need to put down a marker and identify that the required representation is 40%. That is what we need to insert in the Bill rather than the vague statement, &ldquo;shall have regard to the desirability ...&rdquo;, which is no more than aspirational.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>What is needed in this section is an example of what is appropriate, which is that no fewer than 40% of members appointed to the board should be women and no fewer than 40% should be men. A presentation was made recently by women engaged in agriculture to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. It was striking to hear that in the not too distant past more than 50% of those engaged in agriculture were women, but there has been an alarming decline in that figure. There is also a sizeable minority of women on board positions in main farming bodies, despite the fact that they make up a large percentage of those involved in the agricultural sector. That involvement is not reflected in their representation on these boards. It is essential that we set an example in this legislation. Such example should be given by this House. I fully support the amendment, the principle underlying it having been a statement of intent by the Government and elected representatives. The insertion of such a provision would be an example to the other main bodies associated with the agricultural sector and one for them to follow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what has been said by Deputies Upton and Ferris. I refer to the earlier debate on the Private Security Services Bill, which contained similar wording to that contained in this section. It must be a Government policy to insert this type of wording in this respect. The relevant section in the Private Security Services Bill states that in making appointments to the authority, the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented in its membership and shall ensure that an appropriate balance in this respect is maintained. The relevant section of this Bill states that the board in making nominations to the horticulture subsidiary board, and the Minister in considering whether to consent to such <Col N="209"/>nominations, shall have regard to the desirability of achieving an appropriate gender balance.</P>
    <P>The only appropriate gender balance is that such representation should be reflective of society on this island where 52% of the population is female. The wording of the section is woolly and does not give a guarantee in this respect. The Minister of State indicated that the Government will ensure that there is an appropriate gender balance, but his successor might not be as favourably disposed in this respect or a future Minister might decide, as has happened in the past, that the appropriate gender balance is zero representation by women, with the result that there would be no female members on this board. The only way of guaranteeing that at least 40% the members of the board are men and 40% are women, as specified in Deputy Upton&rsquo;s amendment, is by inserting the percentages in the section for the future to prevent a Minister reneging on this measure and discriminating against one sex.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Ferris seeks to ensure that 50% of the board membership should be women. That is the target towards which the Government should be moving, but the Deputy proposes to withdraw his amendment in favour of securing at least the minimum requirement in regard to gender balance. In line with its supposedly public position on ensuring a proper gender balance on the membership of boards, the Government must comply with that minimum requirement in future. The wording of the section does not guarantee that a future Minister will comply with this ideal announced by the Government in the past. We must ensure that amendment No. 21 is accepted. That would send out a message that this is the type of wording that should be included in this respect in all future legislation rather than woolly wording such as &ldquo;an appropriate gender balance&rdquo;. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Private Security Services Bill, the Minister said that there were not enough women in that sector, but that should not be a reason for deciding the number of women members on a board. If we are trying to encourage women to participate in farming, private security services or some other sector, we should ensure that any board is reflective of society in general. I urge the Minister of State to change the woolly wording in this section.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Women&rsquo;s Rights discussed these issues on a number of occasions, he said there are ways to ensure such provision. He said that the <Col N="210"/>nominating organisations can put forward the names of two people, one male and one female, and when the Minister is making such appointments, he or she can choose to ensure membership of the board is made up of 50% women and 50% men, or in this case no fewer than 40% of each gender. There are mechanisms for meeting this requirement. In Europe and elsewhere there are examples which such gender balance on boards works. Provision for such gender balance is an important message to send, not only to those in the farming and horticultural communities but to the wider public that the Government is serious on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at one with the aspirations of the Deputy to achieve such balance. We are totally committed to that. It is the goal of the Government to ensure that we are able to fulfil the statutory requirement of 40% representation in all the appointments we make, but we also depend on the nominating bodies to make sure they make their contribution to that complement. That is critical. We are striving, might and main, in all our discussions, negotiations and communications with them to ensure that they do that. If a board is to proceed, we depend on the nominating bodies to fulfil their membership criteria and to ensure that, in so far as is possible, they nominate a female representative. The Members can be assured that the Minister has the right to refuse nominations that do not meet this criterion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton asked a simple question and we want to ensure, in so far as it can be done, that we meet that 40% representation requirement on boards and sub-boards. We will strive might and main to achieve it. We hope will we get the co-operation of everybody concerned to ensure that we meet the targets that have been set, the achievement of which is desired by all. I am optimistic and confident that we can achieve it through the co-operation of the various bodies and the nominating organisations in particular. The wording is in place to ensure that such balance is achieved. The wording is solid and there is the security of the Minister&rsquo;s right to refuse nominations. On that basis, I believe Members should accept what is proposed.</P>

	<P>The facts speak for themselves. There is one accident on our roads every 21 minutes and one person killed on our roads every 23 hours. Behind these statistics lies the personal grief and suffering of many families involved in such tragedies. For example, people could not be but touched by the report of nine year old Alyssa Blazer who was left orphaned last year after her father was killed in a road accident, just a year after her mother was killed in a car crash in the Canary Islands.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.5-?><P>Since January of this year, road fatalities are up by one quarter on those of the same period last year. While the Minister for Transport is prepared to introduce new laws, he has shown that he is not prepared to fund their enforcement. This makes a farce of the gains made since the introduction of the penalty points system. Both the Garda and the Minister for Transport use the penalty points figures to highlight their success in implementing their road safety measures. Penalty points were never devised to put people off the road. The system was developed to get people to change their attitude, abide by the rules, improve their driving standards and thereby save lives.</P>
    <P>I support a system which saves lives and is fair. While there is no doubt that the penalty points system has saved lives and has the potential to save thousands more, there are, however, serious questions about its fairness. Unmarked vans and cars hide on the sides of long, straight, wide sections of road trying to catch anybody who is just over the speed limit so garda&iacute; can meet their quotas.</P>
    <P>It was admitted publicly by members of the Garda last week that they had been issued quotas by their superiors. If we want a policy of zero tolerance, we must accept that these people are breaking the road traffic legislation, but this method of filling quotas will do nothing to change their attitude or save lives, especially in light of the downright stupid speed limits &mdash; 30 mph limits on dual carriageways and 60 mph limits outside national schools. The penalty points system will only work if nationwide speed limits are reasonable and logical; this is currently not the case. It is imperative that our speed limits are reformed. There is little point pressing ahead with new offences under the system without an overhaul of speed limits across the country.</P>
    <P>This Government must remember that drivers have rights too. The penalty points system was devised to change attitudes. Why, therefore, do we have a situation where it takes months to inform people of their speeding offences? By the <Col N="215"/><?oasys _fc?><?oasys _cl11-?>time drivers have received their first penalty points notice, they could have clocked up two or three more penalties of which they are unaware. Where two points could have slowed a driver down and highlighted the need to &ldquo;heed your speed&rdquo;, instead they end up with six or eight points.</P>
    <P>The paper-based penalty points system is grinding to a halt because of the lack of resources and is having a dramatic impact on the ability of garda&iacute; to enforce the system. Only a pilot computerised project is expected to be up and running by June of this year, despite the impression given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the computerised system would be fully functional by then and the personal commitment given by the Minister for Transport to rank and file garda&iacute;.</P>
    <P>To date, the penalty points system has saved the economy &euro;148 million. The National Safety Council estimates that the implementation of the new road safety strategy will cost approximately &euro;60 million. It does not take an accountant to figure out that significant savings can be made by properly funding the road safety strategy. However, the Minister Transport, even armed with this information, has failed to resource the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>I was informed in May 2003 that the forthcoming road safety strategy, which was to commence in January 2003, was under review and being finalised. This strategy is seen as the key priority within the Department of Transport to reduce accidents and cut insurance premiums. We are now 16 months without a road safety strategy and 446 more people have died on Irish roads. It now seems that these issues are no longer a priority. There is no way garda&iacute; will be able to meet the targets set out in the strategy when it is published, particularly in terms of enforcing speed laws. This fact is supported by a confidential Garda document which states that just 3% of the target number of speed checks can be performed with existing resources.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year, there has been a significant reduction in Garda manpower due to a redeployment of staff to cover the demands of the European Presidency. When we add this to the problem of bureaucracy associated with the penalty points system and the failure to roll out fixed speed cameras across the country, it is no wonder the carnage on our roads is increasing.</P>
    <P>This Government has, over the past seven years, dragged its heels in implementing its strategy to improve road safety. On top of that, it is failing to deliver on its programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Currently, there are only 144 members of the Garda Traffic Unit on duty at any one time in Ireland. The number of traffic unit garda&iacute; on duty falls further when administration and leave periods are taken into account. Research in other countries has shown clearly that the level of <Col N="216"/>enforcement must be increased for the penalty points system to have any long-term impact on driver attitudes and accident statistics. The Government has failed in this respect.</P>
    <P>Government has not delivered on its promise to create a Garda traffic corps. Instead there is a departmental turf war regarding the establishment of the new road traffic corps between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, with conflicting views on the creation of a traffic corps. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has said it is not possible to create the corps as it would not be part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Attorney General has advised that a conviction would not stand up in court. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has refuted this and claimed that the corps is still on the agenda. Does anybody know what is going on? None of us will forget his downright irresponsible comments on provisional licences in December 2003, which led to a 13-month backlog in an already chaotic driving test system. I am sure the Department officials were impressed with that comment. Unfortunately, that type of comment from the Minister is not uncommon.</P>
    <P>As late as October of last year the Department rowed in behind the Minister, who was toeing the line with regard to this announcement when he stated in a parliamentary reply that he was reviewing second provisional licences, that second provisional licence holders would require somebody to accompany them and that this would be implemented by the end of 2003, with less than two months to go. If the Minister really wanted to address the problem rather than getting yet another sound bite, why does he not address the real scandal of provisional drivers whereby professional drivers hold such licences. That, however, would not get headlines. This was nothing more than one of the Minister&rsquo;s usual half-cocked ill thought out measures.</P>
    <P>The current situation is chaotic. One in four drivers on Irish roads has not passed the driving test. The high number of provisional licence holders driving is largely due to a 43% driving test failure rate. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system which allows nearly 1,400 people flunk the test every week. There is something wrong with a system, which sees a 4% improvement in driving standards of young male drivers on passing their test and, which is prepared to tolerate a 20% variation in the pass rates at different testing centres around the country. How could anybody stand over such a system? The Minister has said this is a European system. I doubt that there is any country throughout the European Union that could stand over such statistics.</P>
    <P>There are several reasons for the failure of this system. The Government refuses to regulate driving instructors. It is not prepared to provide a structure for driver training. The driving test <Col N="217"/>needs to be urgently reformed. For example, the result sheet given to drivers who fail the test does not explain what they did wrong. The problems caused by poor road safety standards need to be tackled in a coherent and comprehensive manner. This is not being done at present.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael wants to see better driver education at all stages of life, an improved, reformed, modern driving test, an environment that encourages good driving and punishes those who endanger the safety of others. Fine Gael is calling for the establishment of a mandatory approved training course for driving instructors together with a statutory register on to which all instructors must be placed before taking up employment in the sector. At the moment, new drivers can be faced with an instructor who is unqualified to teach them. As the law stands, the instructor on whom the new driver is depending may not have passed the test. Would we allow doctors be trained by someone with no medical qualifications? The potential to pass on bad driving techniques and habits is obvious. Last June the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, appeared before a D&aacute;il committee and gave a commitment that a new register of driving instructors was imminent. We still await its introduction.</P>
    <P>The driving test has not been reviewed for some twenty years and is therefore not reflective of today&rsquo;s traffic, or modern road engineering, not to mention vehicle engineering. For example, even though more motorways are being built throughout the country, competence in driving on a motorway is not examined under the current test. The test should be reformed to include the option of a longer test and-or continuous assessment for nervous applicants. Applicants with low literacy skills should also be catered for. This is not done at the moment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes a change in the status of the provisional licence which at present is the same as a full licence. This would mean a maximum of six penalty points for provisional licence holders; that provisional license holders must maintain a zero blood alcohol level, that L plates must be clearly visible at all times; that all drivers either of cars or motorcycles must complete a short competency course before they go on the road for the first time &mdash; this could be done during the summer months or as part of the academic school year and could easily be funded from savings in road fatalities.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is also calling for the establishment of a road accident investigation unit. We do not know the root cause of many accidents. There are statistics as to causes of accidents. While drink driving and speeding are major contributing factors to our poor road safety record, they are not necessarily the main cause of the accident. There are no accurate figures in respect of drink driving and the number of fatalities involved. There is no way of collating these unless the coroner tests the blood alcohol level of people who have been involved in a fatal road traffic <Col N="218"/>accident, compiles the figures and makes them available. That is at the discretion of the coroner and the figures are not compiled. Therefore, no figures are available. What we need is a system under which investigations into the causes of accidents will be carried out automatically.</P>
    <P>At present, the National Roads Authority has responsibility in this regard. The NRA compiles statistics relating to dangerous stretches of national roads, but if one asks communities around the country about accident black spots, it is clear that many black spots are not included in the statistics. According to the NRA 2.5% of all accidents are caused by road conditions. What else would it say? It is responsible for ensuring that roads are safe. It will not say roads are a major contributing factor to road accidents. However, communities will say that bad sections of roads, bends in roads and so on have not been addressed, that the local authorities and the NRA are aware of them but have turned their backs on the problem. That is why it is critically important to have an independent road accident investigation unit to examine and report independently on the causes of accidents.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that by seriously targeting road safety in a way that balances the right to drive with the responsibility to drive safely we can cut down on death and injury and thus reap the benefits of safer roads, fewer grieving families, fewer serious injuries and lower insurance costs. We need to tackle bad driver behaviour on every front &mdash; punishment for dangerous drivers, reward for careful motorists, better instruction and improved research. Anyone driving on our roads is entitled to know they can return home safely, but the current accident rate increases the risk of ending up in an accident and emergency unit every time we drive. I firmly believe that Irish motorists can become safer and better drivers, but only if they feel they are being treated fairly by the system. Only then can Ireland hope for safer communities, stronger families and an equal chance of a long and healthy life for everyone whether or not they drive. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion and congratulate Deputy Naughten on his initiative in proposing it. I also congratulate him and thank him for the work he has been doing during the lifetime of this Government since he took up the position of spokesman on transport. He has been one of the most active Front Bench researchers and one of the most vocal in expressing his view on his responsibilities and he is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s road traffic initiative is a shambles. We had great expectations of an improvement in road safety and a reduction in the number of deaths and injuries. After 12 months of a road safety programme that was introduced with a fanfare, the rate of road deaths has returned to its level <Col N="219"/>prior to this initiative. The road fatality rate for 2004 has increased by 25% on the 2003 level.</P>
    <P>The success of any programme or initiative is measured by its outcome. It is clear from the outcome of this initiative that it has been a total failure. While there was an initial improvement, it has dissipated as a consequence of a lack of commitment on the part of the Government, particularly the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan.</P>
    <P>The level of funding for road safety is paltry and no road safety strategy is in place for 2003-04. One has to have a strategic approach and a set of objectives when one is introducing any programme. If one adopts a wing and a prayer attitude and hopes for the best, one will not achieve any success. All programmes require investment. It is obvious that the Government is not committed to this programme because it is not investing.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are just three speed cameras in the country is an indication of the approach the Government has taken to what was heralded as an initiative that would substantially reduce the level of road accidents. It was hoped that the programme would change the behaviour of drivers. There was an initial change as a result of the hype that surrounded the advent of the penalty points system, but those of us who drive on national primary and secondary roads are aware that it has not endured. I have observed the speed of traffic on such roads, for example when drivers are overtaking.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has admitted that it is under-resourced and is unable to meet its targets, as outlined to it. It is appalling that the number of speed checks undertaken by the Garda is just 3% of that mentioned in the programme. Some 75% of motorists who are given penalty points are apprehended in zones in which one should drive under 30 or 40 mph. Fine Gael does not condone the breaking of any speed limit at any time, but it is aware that major accidents take place at very high speed levels. An initiative to re-examine speed zones should be started as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We need to concentrate on drivers who have provisional licences and to ensure that they can take driving tests. Such drivers have been practically ignored by the Government. There are 232,000 such drivers on a waiting list at present, an increase of 51,000 since 2001. Fine Gael has criticised the Government&rsquo;s performance in this area and Deputy Naughten has brought forward a proposal to remedy the problems that exist. The Minister should examine the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, which will assist him in achieving a higher degree of road safety and a reduction in the number of deaths and injuries on our roads in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that the acquisition of driving skills does not begin and end with the taking of a driving test. Road safety is too important an issue for it to be appropriate that a <Col N="220"/>person should take one driving test in a lifetime. We need to consider driving in terms of life-long learning, so that we can become better drivers and our roads can be made safer.</P>
    <P>People are apprised of changes and new developments in most spheres of competence. The ongoing education of drivers should be the norm, given that there have been such changes in traffic levels, traffic control and the condition of roads. As they renew their licences, drivers should be expected to demonstrate that they have examined changes and brought themselves up to date with new developments. I do not suggest that they should have to sit a driving test, because a test is merely an indication of how one performs at a certain point in time, which is important in itself.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes that road safety be studied in secondary schools during transition year. Students should take part in a road safety programme designed to instil in drivers the importance of observing speed limits, the drink driving laws and the rules of the road. Such a programme, to be drawn up in conjunction with various interested bodies, will act as an early starting point for good driving behaviour.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also proposes that advanced driver training and an advanced driving test be made available to those who wish to promote their driving skills for personal or professional reasons. My party will provide for traditional training and testing, to allow for a generally accepted industry standard of advanced driving skills which will be recognised by employers and insurers as part of the development of a safe driving culture. It would be an advantage for a person seeking employment as a driver to have such skills and such advanced driving training.</P>
    <P>The training and testing programme I have outlined will be part of an overall package of reform that includes the establishment of a register of organisations and specialist instructors who can provide training. Deputy Naughten has referred to the lack of control in the area of driver instruction, a matter which has been discussed over a number of years. Perhaps the Minister will address in his reply any proposals he has to ensure that driving instructors have the level of competence required to ensure that the imparting of skills to trainees is of the highest level. Some of the charges made to trainees are of that nature.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes that driver refresher courses be introduced. As the population ages, there will be an increase in the proportion of older people who are driving on our roads. The fact that older people tend to drive less frequently and slower than other drivers is reflected in their lower involvement in car accidents. Many older people have mentioned to me that they are concerned and disappointed by the reduction in the time period in which they are entitled to a driving licence without ongoing medical examination. While the current approach has some merit, we have to realise that people age at <Col N="221"/>different stages of their lives. A person who is 70 may be as capable as a person aged 50, or a person aged 60 may be as incapable as a person aged 80. We have seen that people age at different times.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not right to introduce a blanket system which states that when one is 70, one has to undergo an examination. I suggest that medical personnel should have the discretion to say when a person should be examined for the purposes of renewing his or her driving licence. I have encountered a certain resentment among old people about the manner in which they are treated.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has suggested that we examine the possibility of providing refresher courses for older drivers because it is keen to find ways of helping them to drive safely for as long as they are fit to do so, rather than taking measures to prevent them from driving at all. This recommendation is consistent with my earlier statement that knowledge and skills should be upgraded on an ongoing basis. A variety of different methods should be used to that end, including observed driving and pre-drive and post-drive briefing sessions by trained driving instructors. We should provide more information and advice and encourage refresher courses for older drivers. In that manner, we can ensure that drivers of all ages continue to drive safely throughout their lives.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes the introduction of a driver&rsquo;s logbook and new teaching methods. As driving involves a myriad of skills, it is time that resources were provided to equip learner drivers with the knowledge they will need and the skills they will use. Fine Gael proposes the publication of a learner driver&rsquo;s logbook that will provide a structured approach to learning. It will contain a modern driving syllabus relevant to today&rsquo;s road conditions. It will provide driving instructors with a framework for training, allow trainees to track their progress and give trainees a guide for practice.</P>
    <P>The logbook will cover diverse areas such car control skills and manoeuvres, driving at night, driving in adverse weather and environmental issues. In that way, we can ensure that new drivers have the knowledge they need to drive well and to stay safe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Naughten on tabling this motion as road safety is a growing concern. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the House to make our roads safe.</P>
    <P>On the second class roads of County Mayo and throughout Connacht, one often sees signs indicating &ldquo;black spots&rdquo;. Many have been there for the past 20 years, with up to ten people killed in road accidents at each one. Local councils also have a responsibility to ensure road safety.</P>
    <P>Drink driving is the main cause of road accidents yet we are afraid to condemn it. Whatever we have against doing so, it must be <Col N="222"/>recognised as the greatest killer. In the two hours after the pubs close, there are always fatal road accidents. Not enough resources are given to the Garda to deal with the many people who still drink and drive. Added to this, there is the growing lunacy of people driving while high on drugs. However, the Garda have not been given the resources to test those driving under the influence of drugs. In a fatal road accident, if a driver is arrested, he or she should be immediately tested for drink and drugs. The findings should then be released to the media when the inquest is being heard.</P>
    <P>There is much discussion about driver behaviour but little about pedestrian behaviour. Drivers are required to have their vehicles in good order and must learn to drive properly. Yet, every winter&rsquo;s evening on primary roads when there is little or no light, one will encounter pedestrians wearing dark clothes. The wearing of armbands in the winter months must be made compulsory. Pedestrians have responsibilities as well as car drivers. If a pedestrian is found not wearing an armband, he or she should be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There are pedestrians who defy drivers in every city and village, expecting drivers to halt when walking across the road. Those pedestrians have responsibilities and yet they are never prosecuted for such actions. Many drivers cannot anticipate what these pedestrians will do. Very often when a driver is about to pass them, they will simply walk out in front. I have noted people ignoring traffic lights, yet I have never seen a prosecution for this. The concept behind traffic lights is simple: stop for red &mdash; go for green. However, many pedestrians &ldquo;jump the lights&rdquo;, frightening drivers in the process.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts in addressing road safety. Every life that can be saved and every accident that can be prevented is important. The penalty points system has worked to a degree. However, young people need to be aware that a car can be described as a monster. If a car ran into a crowd, it would kill many. If one wants to use a gun, one must get a licence every year from the Garda. A car is more dangerous than a gun.</P>
    <P>The time has come when every young person from the age of 16 years should be trained how to drive properly. Such education programmes have already begun with tidy towns and recycling. School is the best place to give young people the opportunity to learn good driving skills.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Naughten on bringing this motion to the floor of the House. There will have to be a sea change in how we handle road safety. I am behind any proposal by the Minister for Transport that will save one life or see one less person injured on our roads. However, I am not satisfied with the road safety programme so far. Driving tests will have to be dramatically changed. I will not go into the nuts and bolts as Deputy Naughten did, but <Col N="223"/>incentives will have to be introduced to encourage higher driving standards.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that over the last five years, road fatalities have dropped by 20%. One fatality is too many but this must be welcomed. However, the insurance companies have simply piled on the premia. Only in the last year &mdash; though for different reasons &mdash; was some calm introduced to the motor insurance market. However, more control of the insurance companies is needed. The way they are in concert with each other reminds me of the arrangements between the meat factories. Instead of allowing the insurance companies to cherrypick, they must be made to give a quotation to every single driver. It is not enough for an insurance company to give a premia quotation of &euro;4,000 to a young driver.</P>
    <P>An injustice is being done to many young people in car insurance. I admit statistics show that the greatest number of claims come from the 18 to 25 year old age group. However, many young drivers never have a motor accident. Many are law-abiding drivers, never under the influence and careful and considerate road users. Why must they carry the can for the others who break the road laws? Many young people need a car to travel to work. It is a great injustice that every young driver is tarred with the same brush. Why are careful young drivers penalised for the madness of others? Why should those who drive recklessly drag down every law abiding young driver with them? There should be a fixed discount by right, not at the whim of the insurance companies. Many people would choose to submit to advanced driving tests and so on in order to qualify. The matter of fraudulent and exaggerated claims is a very important one. People who attempt to make fraudulent claims should be very severely dealt with.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this important debate. I commend Deputy Naughten for putting down this important motion for debate. Those of us who live in constituencies more than 100 miles from Dublin must do a lot of driving. Every day when we get into our cars we are aware of the dangers on our roads. We all become frightened when we see bad traffic accidents on the road. They happen on a weekly basis &mdash; sometimes daily, particularly at weekends.</P>
    <P>In the course of travelling around our constituencies there are a few issues that strike us. One of the most important, which has been neglected, is the issue of traffic calming in villages and smaller towns. In my constituency there are many smaller villages on regional and national routes which have no traffic calming measures. During my time on the local authority we were constantly writing to the Department seeking funding for these measures. It took four years of extensive lobbying to obtain the funding for traffic calming in New Inn, a small village on the <Col N="224"/>Dublin to Cork road. The measures were sanctioned just 12 months ago and the job has been completed. There were so many accidents and near misses in that small village that people were frightened to cross the road. The traffic calming project for that village can be held up as an example.</P>
    <P>There are other villages across the country, from Donegal to Cork to Wexford, that need traffic calming. I suggest that, as a matter of urgency, substantial moneys should be put aside over the next number of years to provide traffic calming measures for those villages so that people can walk around safely. We have village renewal and town renewal but there is no traffic calming, which is the essential to saving lives. I urge the Minister to find the funding for traffic calming measures.</P>
    <P>Next year people will be coming to live in the countryside in large numbers because of decentralisation and we need to make sure the villages where they will live are safe. I know there is already support for this view on the Government back benches. There are villages in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency, such as Pallasgreen in east Limerick, that need further traffic calming.</P>
    <P>My son has just started to drive in the last few weeks. It is quite an experience to see how keen young people are to be behind the wheel when they reach the age of 17 and obtain their provisional licence. He is anxious to drive and anxious to be safe. It struck me quite forcefully that he and others like him had not been trained in secondary school. It is vitally important that driver training is introduced in schools. Deputy Naughten has mentioned this and it is included in our policy document. It would not be costly. It would be a reasonable and timely measure for this Government to introduce, particularly for students in transition year. Young people are anxious to drive safely and carefully. I urge the Minister to take this into consideration.</P>

    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that the Minister for Transport will shortly publish a new road safety strategy, which will cover the period <Col N="225"/>2004 to 2006, and is based on the work of the high level group on road safety;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>commends the Government on the continued pursuit of policies on an integrated basis that is based on the contributions of all of the bodies involved in the promotion of road safety, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Roads Authority and the National Safety Council;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that in the 17 months since the introduction of penalty points road deaths have fallen by more than 100 when compared to the preceding 17-month period;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>acknowledges that Garda numbers are at their highest ever level, that recruitment is being prioritised to bring the force to its authorised strength of 12,200 and that significant increases were secured for the Garda in this year&rsquo;s Estimates, bringing the allocation to more than &euro;1 billion for the first time;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is planning to support existing Garda resources by means of innovative private sector involvement, such as the outsourcing of certain administrative functions and the privatisation of speed cameras;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p3-?><?oasys _ix?>commends the Minister for Transport on his commitment to reform the provisional driving licence system in order to reduce long-term reliance of drivers on provisional licences and notes that a package of measures to achieve this objective is being finalised by the Minister;</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">There is little doubt that everybody in this House has either had personal experience of a road collision or knows somebody who was either killed or injured as a result of such a collision. This happened in my own family in years gone by. It is appropriate that the subject of road safety should be debated here and I am grateful to Fine Gael for offering me the opportunity to outline the progress that has been made and to consider the issue.</P>
    <P>So far this year the trend in terms of road deaths has been worrying and disappointing. However, I am both hopeful and confident that over the long term we will see the fruits of the policies that are being implemented in the form of a sustained reduction in road collisions and the resultant deaths and injuries.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Fine Gael motion, one would think there was no Government programme relating to road safety. In 1998 it was this Government that undertook the establishment and publication of the first national road safety strategy. As a result of the implementation of the policies set out in that strategy, road deaths are year-on-year significantly reduced from the position the Government inherited. I find it unusual that in its motion Fine Gael expresses its deep concern at the lack of a national road safety strategy. The parties opposite did not produce a road safety strategy when they were in office. I am glad to note that the main Opposition party has now adopted the demands for a road safety strategy and we will not differ on that issue.</P>
    <P>The situation facing this Government in 1997 was unacceptable. In that year alone 472 people died on our roads. As Deputy Ring pointed out, one is too many. Road deaths in the period 1995 to 1997 amounted to 1,362. That was 112 greater than in the preceding three years. The first road safety strategy became effective from the beginning of 1998. I ask the House to note that in the first three years of the strategy, road deaths fell to a level of 1,286 and that in the last three years the numbers were down to 1,128. One can only imagine the trauma and horror behind these numbers.</P>
    <P>This improved performance, if one can call it that, was achieved because the Government, having seen the inertia in the system, chose to adopt a strategy based on delivery. Central to its achievement was the fact that all the agencies directly involved in road safety played a role in the development of the strategy and oversaw its delivery.</P>
    <P>Road safety is a multidisciplinary area of policy. For that reason the high level group on road safety, on which is represented all the agencies and Departments who have a direct engagement in the delivery of the various aspects of road safety, was tasked with the oversight role. <Col N="227"/>The development of road safety is primarily a function of Government and the strategic approach adopted after 1997 was the subject of Government approval.</P>
    <P>The first road safety strategy, covering 1998 to 2002, established a target of realising a 20% reduction in the number of road deaths and serious injuries over the five-year period of the strategy by comparison with the position in 1997. By the end of 2002 that target had been achieved in the case of road deaths and had been surpassed in the case of serious injuries. If we look at the trends that occurred over the lifetime of the strategy we see that significant reductions in fatalities and serious injuries were recorded in 1998 and 1999 and again in 2002. The downward trend in fatalities continued in 2003 when we recorded the lowest number of fatalities, 341, since 1964. Over this 40-year period, the number of vehicles and drivers in Ireland has more than quadrupled.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy specified demanding and quantified targets in regard to road safety in Ireland and the Government and the road safety agencies have held themselves accountable regarding to their targets. We will do likewise with the new road safety strategy to cover the period 2004-2006, which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The headline initiative proposed under the first strategy was the introduction of the penalty points system. The full system has not been deployed yet and this is disappointing. However, accepting that the full roll out of the system would have to be delayed, I was determined that it should be introduced as quickly as possible, despite these obstacles, in regard to speeding offences. Excessive speed is a crime. However, the contribution of excessive speed in terms of the number and consequences of collisions is such that by making a determined effort to address and tackle that problem, I was of the opinion that the early deployment of penalty points could lead to a significant return in improved road safety generally.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of the Garda, the effect of the application of penalty points to speeding offences has been dramatic. This effect can be summarised succinctly by reference to the fact that the number of road deaths during the 17 months following its introduction was 100 less than in the previous 17 months. This was some success and I have also overseen the extension of the penalty point system to the key offences of seat belt wearing and motor insurance. It is my intention to extend the system to cover careless driving from June.</P>
    <P>In addition to the initiatives I have taken in respect of penalty points, I have also provided for the extension of the basis for the operation of preliminary roadside breath testing. A form of random testing was introduced prior to Christmas. This was promised in the road safety strategy. We did not, as some have suggested, recommend the introduction of full random <Col N="228"/>breath testing but I intend to introduce full random breath testing in the upcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>I have ensured that the promotion of road safety has been established as one of the high level goals for the Department. The adoption of a strategic approach to the delivery of road safety policies presents the best option for achieving results. The national strategy, allied to the central monitoring carried out by the high level group on road safety, provides a benchmark for future policy development. The actions identified in the strategy represented positive value by comparison to the investment needed. Deputy Naughten stated that &euro;148 million has been saved as a result of the introduction of the penalty points system.</P>
    <P>On foot of a commitment in The Road to Safety, a study carried out in 1999 by Peter Bacon &amp;  Associates, it was estimated that the first national road safety strategy would have a cost-benefit ratio of 1:8.3 following complete implementation. The relationship between costs and benefits in road safety is complicated by the number of bodies involved and the fact that the benefits, in financial terms, do not accrue to the agencies making the necessary investments. As part of the programme of public expenditure reviews, a cross-departmental expenditure review of road safety measures is being undertaken. The results of the review will assist Government in assessing the benefits of investment in road safety, on a whole of Government basis.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the continued criticism of the funding of road safety by the Opposition. Over the lifetime of the first strategy there was significant investment in Garda enforcement assets and the financial support necessary for the production and presentation of the most effective public awareness campaigns ever mounted on road safety was provided. Many of the campaigns received international recognition for their quality and focus. The Department provided for major investment in programmes to address road collision black spots and to deploy traffic calming measures.</P>
    <P>Exchequer funding in respect of 2004 for road safety agencies under the aegis of the Department of Transport amounts &euro;22.488 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a long way short of &euro;148 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition to Exchequer funding, the Irish Insurance Federation contributes to the National Safety Council&rsquo;s budget and funding is also received from sponsorship sources. Local authorities receive funding for road improvements and remedial measures on non-national roads, which is not included in this figure. Furthermore, expenditure by the Garda on its work is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P><Col N="229"/><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>In proceeding to develop a second strategy, the high level group on road safety considered it appropriate that a major independent review of the previous strategy should be carried out. An international expert on road safety was appointed to examine the overall approach and primary aims established in the strategy. His report confirms that basing the primary targets on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing was the correct approach. The benchmarks for the second strategy, therefore, were to take account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the Road to Safety Strategy 1998-2002 and further positive trends established in 2003, the review of that strategy and developments under the EU third road safety action plan.</P>
    <P>Since I was appointed Minister, I have given particular support to the promotion of road safety at European level. Earlier this month I hosted a meeting of Transport Ministers from the current and accession states specifically to discuss road safety. I also facilitated the first signing ceremony for the Commission&rsquo;s road safety charter, which is a central element of the action plan, and it gives the opportunity to private sector interests to make commitments in this area. More than 40,000 people died on roads of the 15 member states last year. That is equivalent of the population of a large town. This issue must be continually addressed, not only domestically but also at European level</P>
    <P>The programme for Government states a three year road safety strategy will be developed which will target speeding, drink-driving, seat belt wearing and pedestrian safety in an attempt to tackle deaths and injuries. The high level group also prepared a draft new strategy for the period 2004-2006 and I recently received Government approval to publish the strategy. Care has been taken in the preparation of the new strategy. This will be evident in reference to the targets established in respect of the major policy areas addressed in the strategy and their enforcement. The targets will be specific and challenging and will be supported by the establishment within the framework of the strategy of operational plans by each of the main organisations that have contributed to its preparation. Arrangements are being put in place to provide for printing and publishing of the strategy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The strategy will outline a range of issues that will be pursued over the period in question. In overall terms, measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat belt wearing. Over the period of the new strategy the following major road safety policy initiatives will be pursued: the introduction of random preliminary breath testing for drink driving; the introduction of a new speed limit structure to be <Col N="230"/>expressed in metric values; the development of a network of speed cameras to be operated by private sector interests; the finalisation of a comprehensive package of measures to address issues surrounding driver licensing and testing; the roll out of the full penalty points system; and the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to which I remain committed.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of enforcement, the Garda has established commitments to the achievement of specific levels of enforcement across the three key areas of seat belt wearing, speed limits and drink driving. The Garda has issued penalty points to more than 120,000 drivers in the past 17 months. Members can imagine the physical workload involved. They deserve credit for making that happen.</P>
    <P>New legislation is being prepared in my Department which will provide support for the deployment of key initiatives in the area of speed limits and drink driving and will further enhance the enforcement capacity of the Garda. The Bill will feature a number of radical changes that will focus on those key areas. A new system of speed limits based on metric values will be introduced this year. I assure the travelling public that the speed limits applied at specific locations are reasonable and fair and reflect the road safety needs and capacity of the road in question, as pointed out by Deputy Naughten. I have raised this issue with county and city managers. The new speed limit structure will, as was envisaged in the report of the working group I established to review speed limits, offer greater flexibility to local authority members, who will retain primary responsibility for determining the application of speed limits at specific locations.</P>
   <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Garda will be empowered to engage in what is colloquially termed as random breath testing. This is a fundamental initiative, which will greatly strengthen the enforcement capacity of the Garda of drink driving. This is a fundamental initiative. It will greatly strengthen the enforcement capacity of the Garda with regard to drink driving. Before the summer, I intend to bring forward the legislation on random drink testing, and I will be asking the House for strong support on that initiative. This is one of a number of initiatives being developed with regard to the problem of drinking and driving, which as Deputy Ring said, remains one of the most intransigent of road safety problems.</P><?oasys _cl11.6-?>
    <P>Garda enforcement will also be supported by the introduction of private sector engagement in the provision and operation of speed cameras. That legislation will provide the legislative framework for those speed cameras. This is not a money making policy. The operational parameters for the provision of this service will <Col N="231"/>be clearly established, and decisions on the deployment of enforcement assets will remain within the gift of the Garda. This is a very significant initiative in that the introduction of a new source of speed enforcement capability will provide greater freedom for the Garda in the enforcement of other areas of traffic law. In that same context, the Bill will see the removal from the Garda of direct involvement in much of the day to day administrative work associated with the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems.</P>
    <P>The early publication and passage of the Bill is essential if the delivery of the programme established in the new road safety strategy is to be delivered, and I am glad to announce to the House that the Government has today approved the heads of the legislation. The Bill will now be presented to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for urgent drafting with a view to its early publication and presentation to the Members of the House. I look forward to its early passage into law.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment relating to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. As I have already indicated in this House, I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the establishment of this traffic corps is being progressed. The question of the relationship that the corps will have with the Garda, and in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner, is central to the development of this proposal. The establishment of a corps that is wholly independent of the Garda would face formidable hurdles. The powers available to members of such an independent force would need very careful consideration, and there is the overriding issue of the capacity of such individuals to engage in more general police work. The incidents, both here and abroad, where dedicated traffic police were instrumental in the detection of other general activity and the detention of persons involved in such activity, are well documented.</P>
    <P>I note with interest recent media coverage regarding the recruitment in the UK of highway agency officers who are civilians and have been given very limited powers regarding traffic management and highway patrol duties. We will monitor carefully the usefulness of this move in determining if similar arrangements could operate in this country.</P>
    <P>A working group has been established to consider urgently the options available in terms of progressing this proposal. This group comprises representatives from the Department <Col N="232"/>of Transport, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of the Director of Traffic. I will be chairing a meeting of this group over the coming weeks in order to progress this matter personally.</P>
    <P>I am aware that multi-modal investigation units which investigate rail, air and marine accidents are in operation in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Holland and France. However, they do not investigate road traffic accidents, which are investigated in all cases by the police. I understand that in Luxembourg, the accident investigation unit has being expanded to cover road accident investigation, and that in Norway plans are under way to incorporate road accident investigation into the multi-modal investigation unit. In Ireland and in most countries, the primary immediate investigative role in road accidents is vested in the police. Priority in the pursuit of such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents, and in particular to the determination of whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the only body empowered to make such a determination, and to launch criminal proceedings against any person whom the Garda considers should be accused of the commission of an offence. In the final instance it is a matter for the courts to decide on the guilt or innocence of an accused person. The Garda reports relating to an accident provide information to assist the courts in making decisions in such matters.</P>
    <P>Given the pivotal role played by the Garda in accident investigation, it is tasked with the preparation of detailed reports in relation to each accident its members attend. These reports are passed on to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally, and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed necessary. I know that Deputy Naughten has put forward this idea. I have not arrived at a decision but retain an open mind on it, convinced of the added value that would result now from the establishment of such an agency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, it is inside the Garda structures, rather than outside them, that such an agency is being suggested. The Garda itself is seeking it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are fundamental differences between road traffic and all other forms of transport. In the first instance, road transport is to a great extent delivered by individual drivers using their own vehicles. This contrasts with the delivery of transport services <Col N="233"/>by rail, air and sea, which are generally provided by large organisations which may be privately or publicly owned. In addition, and probably because of the involvement of private individuals, road traffic is subject to criminal law in the vast majority of states. For those reasons, I feel that the arrangements currently in place provide a positive and competent response to the needs for traffic law investigation. I have said to Deputy Naughten that I will keep that under review, and I continue to retain an open mind on it.</P>
    <P>Some Members spoke this evening about driver tests and training. The Government&rsquo;s strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which were prioritised by the strategy. Driver formation has in accordance with that strategy been assisted in a number of ways, including the introduction of a driver theory test for applicants for first provisional licences, support for the voluntary driving instructor register and support for an initiative by the Irish Motorcyclists&rsquo; Action Group to establish a network of motorcycle instructors throughout the country. Policy in relation to driver training and licensing will be further considered in the context of the new road safety strategy which I will publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Proposals being developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. That is important. The design of these standards has been formulated by a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests. The original intention was that where an instructor would be accredited to an organisation of driving instructors recognised by my Department as meeting appropriate quality standards, the instructor would be exempted from the requirement to undergo the test. It was envisaged that as part of this process an organisation would have to seek accreditation from the National Accreditation Board that it is operating to a set standard. The legislative basis for implementing these proposals is contained in the Road Traffic Act 2002.</P>
    <P>However, I now propose that responsibility for overseeing implementation of the standard will be given to the proposed driver testing and standards authority. It is not now likely that the National Accreditation Board will be involved in the process. I would of course like to record the Department&rsquo;s thanks to the board and to all involved in it. The standard will apply to all prospective driving instructors. I am considering what arrangements can be put in place to ensure that existing driving instructors also meet this standard. It is important that there is a standard <Col N="234"/>of instruction in which we can all have confidence. I will look to the new authority to set about this work with some urgency.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that a course of initial basic training will be compulsory for learner motorcyclists. It is important that before using their motorcycles on public roads, learner motorcyclists are trained, and made familiar with handling motorcycles. A working group has been established in my Department to advise on the most appropriate means of introducing compulsory initial basic training for motorcyclists.</P>
    <P>I have introduced requirements to assist the operation of the penalty points system. Since I January 2003, persons while driving, and persons acting as accompanying drivers to provisionally licensed drivers, must have their licences with them. I have also announced that measures will be taken to reduce long-term reliance on a provisional licence. Indeed I have been criticised for this by Deputy Naughten</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Road Traffic Acts, a provisional licence may be granted to a person who wishes to learn how to drive a vehicle in order to pass a driving test. This licence provisionally allows a person to drive that vehicle in a public place. Over the years various changes have been made to the regulatory conditions under which provisional licences have effect. I am considering whether further changes are desirable in this regard. In particular, I am reviewing the provision whereby holders of second provisional licences for cars are not required to be accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for that category of vehicle with a view towards ending this arrangement. All other provisional licence holders other than drivers of motorcycles and work vehicles must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times when driving in a public place. I intend to submit detailed proposals for a package of driver licensing reforms to Government shortly. These proposals would be implemented on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>A particular change which I intend to make is to change the title of a provisional licence to that of learner permit. This measure will reinforce the fact that such a licence is designed for learning purposes and is not intended as a driving licence. Primary legislation is required to give effect to this proposal and I hope to include it in legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the driving test. The test has been in operation for over 40 years. The first test took place on 18 March 1964. The Fine Gael motion before the House refers to the high failure rate in the test. This is a misconception. The pass rate for driving tests nationally in 2003 was 54.5%.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="235"/>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the other 45%? That is not a high rate. The Minister would not accept it in the leaving certificate if he were Minister for Education and Science.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is consistent with the pass rate in recent years and is higher than the pass rates in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Another criticism is the variation in pass rates from centre to centre. While there are differences between pass and fail rates at different test centres throughout the country, the experience is similar in the UK. There are a number of reasons that can contribute to variations at different test centres. The number and frequency of driving lessons taken by a prospective test candidate, the quality of instruction received and social and demographic factors are among factors that can affect the test outcome.</P>
    <P>To help candidates a number of initiatives have been put in place in recent times. The driving test report sheet has been revised to give detailed information to the test candidate on the faults incurred during the test and the severity of those faults. This should enable candidates to take appropriate steps to remedy the faults. Also, communication with driving instructors has been improved and supervisory testers now liaise with driving instructors working at test centres to help them deal with queries they may have about the test. The proposals to register driving instructors which I have already outlined will require driving instructors to meet and maintain a predetermined level of competence in delivering instruction. I anticipate this will increase the success rate of test candidates. Driver testers already receive a significant level of training to ensure that as uniform a test standard as possible is applied throughout the country.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in the process of upgrading the motorcycle driving test. The test will be radio controlled and a pilot scheme to assess the new test, which was carried out earlier this year, received a very positive response and there is work being done in that area.</P>
    <P>I note that speakers opposite called for reform of the driving test. I am not entirely clear as to what reform is being asked for but I will read carefully their suggestions to see if I can take them on board. The driving test in Ireland is designed in accordance with an EU standard and the delivery of the test to a uniform standard is achieved by way of the training of testers that I have already outlined. I would welcome any suggestions as to how the test might be further improved and I will take those on board if it is practical to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the increase in waiting times for driving tests which has resulted from the unprecedented volume of 234,000 applications received in 2003. This compares to 146,000 <Col N="236"/>applications for a test in 1998. I accept personal responsibility for that enormous growth which happened as a result of my commitments to reform the provisional licence system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is big of the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What commitments?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The increased demand for tests has arisen from my expressed commitment to take steps to reduce long-term reliance on provisional licences. I presume the Deputies opposite would support the objective of reducing long-term reliance on provisional licences. When those measures are before the House we will be able to debate them in some detail. At present, there are 120,000 candidates awaiting a driving test. Since 1998, the Department&rsquo;s testing corps has been increased from 66 to 118 to deal with the additional workload and had achieved an average waiting time of ten weeks by 2002. To deal with the increased demand in 2003, a bonus scheme was put in place to generate additional capacity. In addition, a number of retired testers have been engaged and they are delivering tests. In addition, testers continue to work overtime.</P>
    <P>Government policy on public sector staffing levels requires that numbers employed be reduced by 5,000 in the period to December 2005. My Department, in common with others, has specific targets to achieve in this regard. However, there has been no reduction in the resource level available to the driver testing service as a consequence of this policy and I am conscious that the service levels must be optimised. There are currently eight vacancies for driver testers and while recruitment to fill these vacancies has been deferred pending discussions with staff representative bodies on the establishment of the driving testing and standards authority, I have requested officials in my Department to explore possibilities for filling of these vacancies.</P>
    <P>Work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of legislation for the driver testing and standards authority. I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill in the current D&aacute;il session. The authority will have responsibility for delivering the driver testing service and will have greater flexibility to respond to variations in demand. In addition, the authority will have overall responsibility for driving standards and this will be the first time that an agency has specifically under law been given the responsibility for improving driving standards. It will also be responsible for registration of driving instructors, which is also long overdue. I envisage the authority becoming a body with responsibility for ensuring that these standards are raised to the highest level possible in the interest of road safety.</P><Col N="237"/>
    <P>In thanking the House for considering this motion, the House will recognise that since the adoption by the Government of the road safety strategy in 1998, steady progress has been made. The facts speak for themselves. That progress has been sustained over the past six years and our aim is to keep that focus into the future. I am concerned at the increase in road deaths but as I pointed out, in the 17 months since the introduction of penalty points, 100 fewer people have been killed on our roads compared to the 17 months prior to the introduction of penalty points. However, it is a constant battle to keep on the pressure and reduce deaths and injuries on our roads, which I am aware is an objective shared by all sides of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Wall.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many areas of transport responsibility where the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has failed to make an impact but there is no area of which that can be said in a more profound way than in the area of road safety. Early in his term of office as Minister for Transport the indications were that the Minister would take this issue seriously. Regrettably, his predecessor, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, had failed to make progress in introducing the penalty points system which was part of the 1998 road safety strategy. The Minister moved early on that and introduced the system in October 2002, and that initiative was welcomed both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>Initially the measure was very successful. People changed their driving behaviour overnight. It was quickly very obvious, whether on motorways or suburban roads, that there was a marked difference because people realised, for the first time in respect of driving, that there was a reasonable chance that if they broke the speed limit they would be caught. In an ideal world it would be nice to think that all of us as drivers would take responsibility for our behaviour and our actions but, unfortunately, we do not. Human nature means that people will try to get away with whatever they can and unless there is a reasonable chance that the law will be enforced, in a rush we take the chance of driving over the speed limit. The measure was welcome because fatalities and serious injuries had reached a critical level and following a number of particularly tragic accidents, the decision was taken to introduce the penalty points system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the success of the system was extremely short-lived. Within a matter of weeks drivers realised that the level of enforcement for road traffic offences was completely inadequate.</P><Col N="238"/>
    <P>While initially there was a good deal of publicity about it, that waned very quickly and it was discovered that very few people were being nabbed for breaking the speed limit. Within a matter of months, people reverted to the original bad habit of exceeding the speed limit.</P>
    <P>It has been quite noticeable in recent weeks that there has been a great deal of talk both at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and in the media about penalty points. I have tried this one or two times recently, since in my own constituency, apart for two very short stretches of motorway, I cannot go beyond 30 mph. The vast bulk of my driving is under 30 mph, and it is exceptionally difficult to do that when I am conscious of the vast majority of cars passing me. The same applies on the motorway if one is trying to keep under 50 mph, 60 mph or 70 mph. The number of cars that will overtake if one keeps to the speed limit is quite remarkable. Clearly, they are driving with abandon and no consciousness of any serious enforcement of speed limits.</P>
    <P>The initial, very positive results from the introduction of penalty points were welcomed by everyone. The Minister certainly got a great deal of credit for that, as was his due. People on this side of the House were quite fulsome in their praise of the action he had taken and the terrific results he achieved within the first few months. Unfortunately, however, that was not sustained, and we have now reverted to old habits. In the first three months of this year there has been a 30% increase in road fatalities compared with last year. The Minister is massaging the figures and taking a 17-month period. I accept that there has been an improvement when one compares that with the preceding 17 months. However, that is not the point. We saw for a short period at the beginning of last year what could be achieved with the proper enforcement of penalty points. The public had expected the system to be enforced strongly and changed its behaviour accordingly. Then it realised that it was not being enforced and reverted. Those are the figures that we should examine &mdash; the first three months this year compared with the first three months of last year.</P>
    <P>It is all the more reprehensible that the figures are so high in the first three months of this year when one considers what could be achieved. It is entirely possible to do it. We know the levels that have been achieved in other EU states and how it can be done. We had the potential to do it last year. For that short period we did so, and it was wonderful. However, it is quite disgraceful that it has not been maintained and that we have allowed the figures to creep up again. That is simply down to the absence of adequate enforcement. I made the point last week that I cannot remember the last time I was stopped at a speed check. I do a fair bit of driving, day and <Col N="239"/>night, and I cannot remember the last time that happened.</P>
    <P>The other issue, apart from the lack of adequate enforcement, is that the penalty points system has been dogged by several difficulties, principally because of the lack of planning regarding its implementation. I will mention a few that have arisen in recent months. It was quite clear that completely inadequate IT back-up was provided for the system. I have yet to figure out how it was that the system was contained in the 1998 strategy and should have been planned for from then; yet now, six years later, we still do not have the basic computer system to support penalty points. That is a scandal. I am not saying it is necessarily the responsibility of the Department of Transport. Serious questions must be answered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, it is outrageous that we have reached this point six years later without that issue having been sorted out. Although every small business, school and organisation around the country manages to be computerised we do not have the basic system in place after five years&rsquo; delay.</P>
    <P>There has been very slow progress in adding the other offences to the scheme. Penalty points, as envisaged by the 1998 strategy, were to cover nearly 70 offences. Progress in adding new offences is painfully slow, and so far only four areas have been included. Another matter of serious concern is the late discovery by the Minister that primary legislation would be required to add the use of mobile telephones to the penalty points system. That is quite incredible. It is an extremely dangerous activity, albeit one in which we probably all engage. It should not be allowed and it is practised because it is not against the law. The Minister has issued several press statements talking about his intention of adding this to the list. It seemed very late in the day that he discovered that he would not be able to do so by regulation and that primary legislation would be required. I noticed that in the Government legislative programme circulated today there is no reference to that.</P>
    <P>The other problem is the series of legal challenges made regarding the issuing of notices for penalty points. There has been conflicting information in the media about how that is to be dealt with. The Minister must make a very clear statement on how he intends to deal with that problem, which has serious implications for many hundreds of cases in the pipeline or likely to arrive in the pipeline over the next year. The invalid speed signs in parts of the country are quite incredible. They have led to unwarranted awards of penalty points. That simple matter could not be hammered out before the introduction of the penalty points system. It is not as if the Minister did not have enough time to do <Col N="240"/>it. His predecessor and he certainly had enough time, as did their Department, to get it sorted out.</P>
    <P>It is clear that public confidence in the system is now quite low, and the knock-on effect of that is that people have reverted to their old driving habits. The Minister&rsquo;s challenge was to stamp that out. Trying to do that now will be even more difficult than it was last year, since he built up people&rsquo;s hopes, saying that he would change habits and behaviour and that there would be serious enforcement. That did not happen. Now he will have to redouble his efforts to get that message across again. Not only that, he will have to put his money where his mouth is and put adequate resources into enforcement.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Garda do not have the capacity to operate the system adequately at the moment. They have admitted as much. We saw their comments reported in the media, where they said they will be able to meet only about 3% of the enforcement target set out in the new strategy. They are quite clearly unable to operate the system adequately; nor should they be expected to do so, given their range of responsibilities. All public representatives are aware of the demands on Garda. We want more of them involved in a whole range of areas, particularly &mdash; I have to say, as a Dublin Deputy &mdash; in combating juvenile crime and anti-social activity. The capacity does not exist in the force. That was one of the reasons Garda capacity was identified as a key issue by people in the Minister&rsquo;s own party before the last election. They recognised that there are not enough garda&iacute; to enforce the law, be it traffic law or criminal law. The Minister then came up with his promise of 2,000 extra garda&iacute; which he has failed to meet since the election. It is quite clear the capacity is not there. Garda&iacute; are regularly saying that to us on a local level. They do not have the capacity to police the streets properly regarding criminal activity. The involvement in enforcing road traffic legislation is an afterthought in many areas.</P>
    <P>There was also the promise of a dedicated traffic corps, but that seems to have completely fallen by the wayside, though it was clearly mentioned in the programme for Government. The Minister specifically said there would be a six-month consultation period after which he would establish the traffic corps. Almost 18 months later we now read in the newspapers that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is saying it is not going to happen and that it cannot happen, because of constitutional impediments. The next day the Minister for Transport is saying it is going to happen. So which is it?</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about setting up a working group. What has he been doing since he was elected? This was a key area that needed to be <Col N="241"/>addressed and it is still a matter of just talk at this stage.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>On Saturday next, 1 May, ten new countries will become full members of the European Union. It is a day that promises to be a wonderful occasion. Unfortunately the wishes of almost 450 million people will not be granted as only nine and a half countries will be joining. Some 313,704 people, or 75% of the voters in the southern part of Cyprus, balloted last weekend to exclude northern Cyprus from becoming a full member of the European Union. The United Nations Secretary General and his team have worked tirelessly over a long period of time in search of a solution to the Cyprus problem. Their efforts produced the Annan plan, which the Greek and Turkish Cypriots voted on last Saturday.</P>
    <P>The plan presented a wonderful opportunity to unite the island and allow both communities entry to the European Union. I have had the pleasure on a number of occasions of visiting northern Cyprus. While it was obvious to me that their public relations was not as it should be, there is no need for any spin on last weekend&rsquo;s result. Greek Cypriots have deprived Turkish Cypriots of becoming members of the European Union. As a rule, countries seeking membership and who hold a referendum, give their people the opportunity to express their view. They are asked a simple question: &ldquo;Would you like to become a member of the European Union or would you prefer not to?&rdquo; Last weekend&rsquo;s referenda were so different. This time Greek Cypriots were asked to vote and regardless of the outcome they were guaranteed membership of the European Union. Not alone were they deciding on their own future, but also that of Turkish Cypriots. While Turkish Cypriots voted in large numbers to accept the Annan plan and become members of the European Union, Greek Cypriots voted three to one to keep them out. This was a despicable result and goes totally against the spirit of the European Union.</P><Col N="242"/>
    <P>At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, disapproval of the Greek Cypriot action was clearly expressed. An agreement was made to provide aid to northern Cyprus, despite the fact that the Annan plan to reunite the island had failed. Reports from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting would indicate that &euro;259 million of European moneys will be made available immediately. While this is welcome and gives some indication of the frustration many EU member states feel about last weekend&rsquo;s poll, it is simply not enough and much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>While it was reassuring to hear Commissioner Patten speak about the introduction of measures to prevent the economic isolation of the Turkish community, urgent action is now required. Last Saturday&rsquo;s result means that next weekend the European Union will admit as a new member a party which has voted against unification of the island. At the same time we will be leaving the Turkish Cypriots out in the cold, despite their vote and efforts to find a solution to the island&rsquo;s problem.</P>
    <P>The embargo and restrictions which have prevented normal economic activity must be lifted. Turkish Cypriots expressed their view last weekend. They have clearly demonstrated a desire to participate as full members of the European family. As a result of the selfishness of more than 300,000 people, that wish has been prevented from becoming reality. We cannot continue to punish the people of northern Cyprus. The international community must respond now. The airports and ports must be opened up. We must allow the residents of northern Cyprus to export their produce to the rest of Europe. They must be allowed to import goods, as happens in all other democratic countries. Northern Cyprus has been forced to survive in an economic straitjacket. Those restrictions must now be removed. Turkish Cypriots must be given the same opportunities afforded their neighbours. All they now seek from the European Union is justice. I hope we will not be found wanting in that regard.</P>
    <P>While I want to welcome the new members into the European family on 1 May, I hope last weekend&rsquo;s result and the tragedy it brought about may be rectified at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who is abroad on EU Presidency business.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Se&aacute;n Power for raising the important issue of the outcome of the referenda in Cyprus. As the House will be aware, the people of Cyprus voted in separate simultaneous referenda on 24 April on the settlement plan which was presented to the parties following negotiations, by the Secretary <Col N="243"/>General of the United Nations. In the event, 75.8% of the electorate in the Greek Cypriot community voted against the plan, while 65% of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour.</P>
    <P>The referenda were the culmination of a long and detailed negotiating process led by the United Nations. I would like to express the deep appreciation of the Government for the patient and determined efforts of Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and his team in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The EU supported the Secretary General fully and the Irish Presidency remained in touch with him throughout the difficult negotiations in recent months. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs also maintained contact with the parties and with the Governments of Greece and Turkey, which each made a positive contribution to the process. In the end, however, the decision on the settlement properly rested with the people of Cyprus exercising their democratic rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the clear preference of the European Union was for the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus. By agreement with the parties, and with the endorsement of the UN Security Council, this outcome could only be achieved through the approval of the settlement plan by both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. The Government regrets that in line with the outcome of the referenda, the accession of a united Cyprus will not now be possible on 1 May.</P>
    <P>Cyprus will join the EU with the nine other new member states, but the application of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> will be suspended for the northern part of the island. This was the decision taken by the Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 in the event that a comprehensive settlement could not be reached by the date of formal accession.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the European Union remains determined to ensure that the people of Cyprus will achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union. We sincerely hope this day will not be long delayed.</P>
    <P>The Turkish Cypriot community has expressed its clear desire for a future within the EU. There is a strong view across Europe that it should not now suffer as a result of the absence of the settlement it supported. The General Affairs and External Relations Council, which met in Luxembourg yesterday under the chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, expressed the determination of the EU to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging its economic development. We look forward to receiving comprehensive proposals from the Commission <Col N="244"/>which focus on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities and with the EU. The Council also decided yesterday that the &euro;259 million which had been set aside for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement should now be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There is a strong sympathy in this House and throughout the country for the people of Cyprus, of both communities. Ireland is proud to have played its part, in the interests of both communities, in the UN force in Cyprus, which was established in 1964 and is one of the longest running UN peacekeeping operations. Without drawing parallels between different political situations, we understand the challenge of working to overcome a history of bitter intercommunal division. We also understand the benefits and the potential for positive change offered by EU membership.</P>
    <P>The Government fully respects the outcome of the referenda last weekend. We regret that the celebrations in Ireland this weekend to mark the historic enlargement of the European Union will not also involve the celebration of a united Cyprus in the Union. However, it should be clear, not least from the conclusions agreed by Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, that the European Union is strongly committed to providing assurance to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future will be in a united Cyprus within the European Union.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the important issue of the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s inability to decide to accommodate in St. Dymphna&rsquo;s school in Ballina a child with moderate Down&rsquo;s syndrome. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, promised me in the Adjournment debate on 31 March 2004 that the matter would be given immediate attention with a view to finding an early resolution. Everybody agrees that this child should be in St. Dymphna&rsquo;s school &mdash; her parents, support worker, in-house adviser, the Western Care Association, the Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Association, the principal of St. Dymphna&rsquo;s school, the psychologist and the principal of Behy national school. They cannot all be wrong. The Department of Education and Science cannot make a decision on this. It is generally agreed also that St. Dymphna&rsquo;s is the best school for this child and that she should not go to St. Nicholas&rsquo;s school or mainstream national school, which is the choice given the parents. They believe the child will not do well at either of these schools. Her mother says the child is inclined to copy others and if she goes to a school for those with a moderate to severely-<Col N="245"/>disabled learning difficulty she will regress from the advances she has made at the playschool she attended for two years.</P>
    <P>St. Dymphna&rsquo;s school is for children with a mild learning disability but there are Down&rsquo;s syndrome children there too. The child&rsquo;s mother was anxious that the child would have some time in St. Dymphna&rsquo;s school before going to mainstream school but now she is in limbo. The child has been assessed as on the mild side of moderate and this raises the question of the assessment process. The Minister of State should examine whether one psychological assessment gives a true picture of where a child should be because it has such serious implications for the child and will determine her future. One psychological assessment is not sufficient. This is the view of the child&rsquo;s mother and of others to whom I have spoken. It must be considered.</P>
    <P>The child&rsquo;s mother feels cheated by the decision to exclude her child from St. Dymphna&rsquo;s. Both parents believe they made an informed choice but that the choice has been taken from them. All concerned are happy to take the child into St. Dymphna&rsquo;s since she met the principal who, with the psychologist and others, is campaigning actively to have the child accepted in the school. This is the first time the school has had to refuse a child and people believe this is in some way due to cutbacks because the consensus is that this would be a good school for the child. To discover that the child could not go to St. Dymphna&rsquo;s was a serious blow, even a slap in the face, to her parents. Her mother feels she was undermined in making her decision. She says that if she brought her elder daughter, who is not learning disabled, to the local convent school and if she was accepted by the principal there it would be unfair for the Department of Education and Science to refuse entry to the child. If it is not right for the able-bodied child why is it right and fair for the disabled child?</P>
    <P>Her mother says this is discrimination against disabled people and that the system has failed her daughter. She referred to the Special Olympics which filled everyone with joy and when people wanted to be associated with disabled people and help them. The Government was also associated with the games but less than a year later we hear of an action which appears to be a cutback. Parents continue to be frustrated in trying to get their children assessed. They wait a long time and are obliged to go to court to gain basic education rights for them. This cannot be right. The disability Bill will supposedly be rights-based and solve all of these problems but it has been delayed.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and urge the Minister of State to address this serious problem.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter and I can understand the frustration of the parents of Breege Molloy and sympathise with their problems in finding a suitable placement for her. Nobody here would prevent parents from seeking the best for their child. It is only right that parents should do so. It would be wrong of anyone here or outside the House to send out the message that this has anything to do with a cutback, quite the opposite. The Department of Education and Science has figures on what has been done for people with special needs. The Minister has done a great job in providing special needs assistants, remedial teachers and other supports.</P>

	<P>Is there a limit on the number of assessments?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The adjudication was based on an assessment. Deputy Cowley rightly referred to the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, who, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, outlined the position that Breege has been assessed by a psychologist as coming within the moderate range of general learning disability. In such cases, parents have the option of seeking a placement for their child in either a special or mainstream national school. Where a special school placement is the preferred choice, the usual option would be a special school dedicated to providing for children such as Breege with a moderate general learning disability.</P>
    <P>In Ballina, the school designated for children with a moderate general disability is St. Nicholas&rsquo;s special school. Breege&rsquo;s parents, however, have sought to have her enrolled in St. Dymphna&rsquo;s special school, which is designated as a school for children with mild general learning disability. I can understand the parents&rsquo; wishes in this regard.</P>
    <P>The good news for the Deputy is that since he last raised the matter, a report and supporting documentation on the case have been received from the local district inspector and these are under active consideration. This will be completed very soon and officials from the <Col N="247"/>Department of Education and Science will then be in contact with the school authorities. The Department will advise the Deputy of the outcome. I am optimistic that the Deputy and Breege&rsquo;s parents will be happy with the placement recommended. Let us not pre-empt the decision except to ensure that Breege is placed in the most appropriate and suitable school and that the decision is made as quickly as possible. I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy and I thank him once again for raising the case in the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight the serious scarcity of dentists and the fact that many parents are being asked to go either to private dentists or to the North and pay between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000 for orthodontic treatment and lesser amounts for other treatments.</P>
    <P>I received two queries on one day from opposite ends of my constituency. The first case related to a family living on the Border with south Armagh in which the youngest child needed orthodontic treatment. Other children in that family had been treated in previous years. The other case came from the opposite end of Cavan, in the difficult terrain of the mountains. Again, an older child in the family had previously received treatment to which the younger child had no access.</P>
    <P>This problem is an indication of what has happened to our health service in recent years. We were able to give the necessary treatment to families at a time when resources were scarce. The economy is now bursting with funds. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is present, can tell us all about dormant accounts and all the rest of it. However, people in relatively poor areas cannot get dental treatment for their children. A family across the Border in County Fermanagh, in the same situation as the family in Bawnboy, would receive treatment. The same is true of the family in Mullyash, County Monaghan; if they lived across the Border, their children would get treatment.</P>
    <P>We are talking about creating a good society. I urge the Minister of State to ensure this situation is seriously examined. Small rural schools, in particular, are being badly hit. My secretary provided me with a long list from a variety of rural schools of children who cannot get attention. Bus services have been removed and now dental services are being removed. In the case of one 13 year old child, older members of the family were treated in less well-off times. Another child who is attending a denominational secondary school in Monaghan town which is quite a long distance from home cannot avail of free dental treatment. However, siblings of <Col N="248"/>neighbouring children who are attending a school in Castleblaney can get free treatment.</P>
    <P>I received all kinds of excuses in response to a letter I wrote to the health board. How does one tell somebody that children on one side of the hedge are not entitled to dental care because they go to a school of their own choice, yet children attending a different school can get treatment for the same needs. Another case I heard of relates to two children attending a single teacher school who are awaiting assessment. The siblings of another 11 year old child did receive treatment. A four-teacher school in a rural area was told in no uncertain terms that pupils would only be seen twice in the course of their primary school education; in first and sixth class.</P>
    <P>Twelve children per month are seen in the clinic in Castleblaney; that is 144 per year. This is a crisis for many lower middle income families. I have sympathy with dental surgeons. The problem is not of their making. In response to a letter on this matter, the health board informed me:</P>
    <P LI="1">Our normal operational policy is to screen and treat 3 classes in primary schools where resources permit. The target classes are 1st, 3rd or 4th and 6th classes. Children outside the target classes can obtain emergency dental care. The shortfall of dentists in particular has meant having to prioritise what target classes can be screened and treated.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Some of these schools do not get any inspection because they are single-teacher schools. This is a crisis. When money was scarce, we made sure our children were looked after. It is all right for those in wealthy families, but it is a crisis for those on low and middle incomes who have to go to credit unions to borrow money to get orthodontic and other treatments for their children. This should not be the reality in modern times when plenty of money appears to be available for everything else.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford raised a number of questions. I am pleased to indicate that I have some positive responses to some of his questions. The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the North Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of that board.</P>
    <P>I note that, based on the waiting list data returned to my Department by the North Eastern Health Board, the situation in the board continues to improve. For example, between March 2002 and March 2004, the treatment waiting list in the board&rsquo;s area has been reduced by 40%, while there continues to be no waiting time for orthodontic assessment.</P>
   
    <P>My Department and the North Eastern Health Board have worked hard to get more children orthodontic dental treatment. Our efforts have been rewarded. In March 2002, the chief <Col N="249"/>executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board informed my Department that there were 2,365 children receiving treatment from the board and at the end of March 2004, the chief executive officer informed my Department that the number receiving treatment had increased to 2,808. This means an extra 443 children are receiving treatment under the board&rsquo;s orthodontic dental service.</P><?oasys _cl11.6-?>

	<P>The Minister is talking about the health board area but not about Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers to the North Eastern Health Board. If the Deputy wants me to focus specifically on Cavan-Monaghan, I will be happy to do so, but I am responding to the question raised. If the Deputy wishes, I will ask the Department to try to obtain information based on the regions, or if he sends me a note on this matter, I would be happy to try to obtain the information sought for him.</P>
    <P>In addition, the North Eastern Health Board anticipates that its community dental service will perform approximately 25,000 dental examinations this year, an increase of approximately 1,500 on the number provided in 2003.</P>
    <P>I have taken a range of measures to improve the orthodontic services nationally and in the North Eastern Health Board. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic dental service. The creation of this new grade will attract orthodontists to work in the health service on a long-term basis; ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of staff in the health board orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists, three of whom are being sponsored by the North Eastern Health Board, in specialist training for orthodontics. In addition, one specialist orthodontist successfully completed her training last year and is working in the board.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of my Department to training developments is manifested in the funding provided for the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor of orthodontics for Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board <Col N="250"/>has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic dental unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private orthodontic practitioners. The North Eastern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;421,000 from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way. My Department has also funded the development of modern regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that 2,808 patients were receiving treatment in the board at the end of March 2004. Orthodontics is unique in that the treatment period for a child is an average of two years. Each year thousands of children, with varying degrees of need, are placed on the board&rsquo;s assessment waiting list. This presents challenges for service delivery and will continue to do so. However, the number of children receiving treatment in the North Eastern Health Board&rsquo;s orthodontic service represents a good performance. It demonstrates the board&rsquo;s determination to reduce the waiting time for treatment and to ensure more children receive treatment. I am also pleased to note that there is only a waiting time of six to eight weeks for children with the most serious orthodontic conditions. I note Deputy Crawford is shaking his head. If the facts and figures I have are incorrect, I would welcome it if he would communicate that to me. I look forward to receiving such a communication.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the unique situation that prevails in the town of Rathkeale, County Limerick, one I have raised over a number of years but to which I have found little positive response from the powers that be at national level. I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.</P>
    <P>Rathkeale is a unique town in the Irish context. It has specific problems which are not found elsewhere. These problems arise from the presence of two distinct communities in the town. Some 45% of the population of Rathkeale are members of the Traveller community and 55% <Col N="251"/>are members of the settled community. Both communities live together with a high level of understanding of each other, friendship and a level of tolerance as there are two cultures in the area. In Rathkeale there are nothing like the difficulties that are experienced in other places where there are sizeable Traveller communities. One does not hear of flashpoints, riots or anything like those problems. Rathkeale is a peaceful town and the crime rate is low.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties because of the two communities in the town but there are not the type of difficulties one might expect, such as those that have been experienced in other communities which would not have anywhere near the level of mixture of the two communities found in Rathkeale. Given the mixture of the two communities, economic and social difficulties have arisen which need to be addressed and should have been addressed long ago.</P>
    <P>The needs of Rathkeale have been ignored. People at national level do not want to hear about the difficulties there. The local county council has made some efforts to examine the situation but they have not amounted to anything worthwhile. When I was elected to Limerick County Council almost 18 years ago, I remember representatives of a group of Departments, including the Departments of Health, Education and the Environment, and representatives of Limerick County Council and the Mid-Western Health Board had a meeting on how to handle Rathkeale. Everybody concerned abandoned the project except Limerick County Council, which eventually came up with one of the many reports on the situation in Rathkeale. At national level, representatives with the highest level of expertise from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department and other Departments, including the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, should meet to examine the situation and to ascertain how assistance can be given to the town to help it develop commercially and socially.</P>
    <P>I want to kill the myth of the possible integration of the Traveller community and the settled community. That is not a runner and never will be. Anyone who understands the Traveller community like I do will understand that it is not a runner. Members of the Traveller community do not want that and I can understand why they do not want it.</P>
    <P>Some 12% of the population of Rathkeale reside in caravans or mobile homes compared to 1% of the population of County Limerick. I want to outline some statistics on the problems in the town. According to a survey of Traveller families, 159 families live in caravans parked in Rathkeale. The population of the town has declined from 1,879 in 1981 to 1,546 in 1996. There is a declining <Col N="252"/>population in the town at a time when the population of the surrounding area has increased by 50%. A major feature of the town is the size of the Traveller population. There is a high level of unemployment in the town with one in four being unemployed, most of whom are young and range in age up to 25 years and they are not members of the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>The town has a high proportion of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, who number 36% compared to 25% in other areas of County Limerick and other countries. Rathkeale suffers from high rates of long-term and youth unemployment. One in five over the age of 15 are unemployed or seeking work for the first time. This is three times the national average. The rate of unemployment among Travellers is not particularly high, as they are employed in trading and similar activities. Some 12% of the population reside in caravans. A quarter of the houses in Rathkeale were built prior to 1999. There has been a decline in the school going population. In Rathkeale a higher proportion of young people, 43%, finish formal education at primary level, as opposed to 22% in County Limerick. There is a need to examine the difficulties there.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem in that there are very poor Travellers. There are Travellers who reside in Rathkeale whom people in the town call &ldquo;our own Travellers&rdquo; and there are Travellers who come to the town with wads of money to buy properties and then close them. That has created difficulties in the town.</P>
    <P>The people of the town need incentives to improve housing and investment in retail and commercial development. A sociological study is also needed to examine how both communities can be best managed. I do not have the answers to the difficulties but officials from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department with a high level expertise need to visit the town in the near future to examine the situation and to recommend the introduction of necessary incentives.</P>
    <P>I discovered today that broadband connection will not be introduced to Rathkeale even though it will introduced to Newcastlewest and Abbeyfeale. This is another case of Rathkeale being ignored again. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his tolerance.</P>

	<P>I accept what Deputy Neville said about Rathkeale. I am replying to this matter from an urban renewal perspective. Rathkeale is unique and there is probably no single solution to the difficulties there.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council had proposed Rathkeale for designation under the 1999 urban renewal scheme. However, in common with several other smaller towns, the proposal for <Col N="253"/>Rathkeale did not obtain a recommendation approval from the expert panel established to assess the plans submitted. Guidelines for the urban renewal scheme made it clear that in selecting areas, local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and that towns with a population of less than 6,000 would find it difficult to qualify. Rathkeale&rsquo;s population at the time was just over 1,500. However, the expert panel recognised that the design of the urban renewal scheme did not address the needs of smaller towns such as Rathkeale and recommended that a future scheme designed for such towns be considered. It was this recommendation that provided the impetus for the town renewal scheme introduced in 2000.</P>
    <P>The town renewal scheme was, therefore, aimed at towns with populations of between 500 and 6,000. The goals of the scheme are to: promote sustainable development patterns; counteract population movement from towns to the surrounding countryside; combat dereliction; and revitalise designated towns as commercial and social centres through the implementation of town renewal plans by the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Rathkeale was one of five towns in County Limerick proposed by the county council for participation in the scheme and, in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department, the council prepared a town renewal plan in which it identified key strategic sites for tax relief designation to act as a catalyst for its successful implementation. The expert panel, in this case, recommended that 29 sites in Rathkeale be designated for a range of refurbishment or new-build incentives in respect of commercial and residential development. Rathkeale has had the benefit of these tax incentives for the past four years.</P>
    <P>In order to enhance the scheme further, residential investor relief, commonly referred to as section 23 relief, was extended in 2001 to all sites that had previously been designated for owner-occupier relief. In Rathkeale, 15 sites, which already had the benefit of owner-occupier incentives, could now also avail of section 23 relief for expenditure incurred on residential new build or refurbishment projects.</P>
    <P>The qualifying period for the scheme was also extended on two occasions, most recently from 31 December 2004 to 31 July 2006 in the budget. There is a requirement that projects which wish to avail of the extension must submit a full planning application to the relevant planning authority on or before 31 December 2004 and, in the case of exempted development, 5% of project expenditure incurred and contracts signed before that date. I accept that the scheme has not been hugely successful in Rathkeale.</P>

It should also be borne in mind that, in addition to the tax relief and grant schemes operated by my Department, there are a number of support schemes in operation by a number of other Departments.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is aware that support is available under the Leader community initiative and the CL&Aacute;R programme. He stated that the population in Rathkeale is in decline. CL&Aacute;R is specifically meant for areas like Rathkeale.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 107 and 114 together.</P>
    <P>The report commissioned from Malachy Walsh and Partners on island transport services was recently completed and presented to my Department. I have now commenced a consultation process with the relevant interests on the islands which were the subject of the report by inviting them to submit observations on the final report by 7 May 2004. On receipt of these observations, I will be in a position to consider further the recommendations of the report. While I do not wish to prejudice this ongoing consultation process, I am pleased with its key findings which confirm the importance of subsidised transport services to the islands. Specifically, the findings are that: ferry services are the lifeblood of the islands and that their need has been confirmed from a socio-economic perspective, the availability of a regular and guaranteed service provides a lifeline service improving the quality of life for islanders, reducing relative remoteness and allowing island populations remain together and to sustain the community identity; the availability of a ferry service also fosters a vibrant tourism industry which contributes to local economic well-being, and to an enhanced awareness and positive appreciation of local traditions, way of life and cultural heritage. Based on the consultants&rsquo; economic analysis and on several broad assumptions, the subsidised sea and air ferry services to the eight islands within the scope of the study result annually in a local tourism spend of at least &euro;12 million; a broader economic impact of &euro;17 million; a contribution to GNP of &euro;11 million; 275 jobs on the islands and elsewhere being supported by the tourism expenditure; &euro;6 million in tax and excise receipts; and ignoring dead-weight, a benefit-subsidy ratio of 4:1, excluding the Aer &Aacute;rann subsidy, or 3:1, <Col N="259"/><?oasys _fc?>including the Aer &Aacute;rann subsidy. A copy of this study is posted on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie .</i></P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 138 and 152 together.</P>
    <P>The report to which the Deputies refer is Bulletin 2 of the 2002-2003 drug prevalence survey which I launched last week. The survey was undertaken jointly by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in Ireland and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland.</P><Col N="262"/>
    <P>Initial results from the survey, which looked at the overall national position, were published last October last year and showed that most of the general population have never used any illegal drug. Less than 19% reported ever taking an illegal drug.</P>
    <P>The second bulletin gives a breakdown of data by health board areas and some of the key findings are as follows: the proportion of those surveyed who reported ever having taken an illegal drug varied between 11% and 29% across health board areas; the lowest rate of recent illegal drug use &mdash; those surveyed who reported using an illegal substance in the previous year &mdash; was recorded in the North Western Health Board at 3% and the highest rate was in the Northern Area Health Board at 8%; prevalence rates of current drug use, those surveyed who reported having used the drug in the previous month, varied from 0.5% in the North Western Health Board to 5% in the Northern Area Health Board; prevalence rates &mdash; lifetime, recent and current &mdash; tended to be higher in the eastern part of the country; cannabis was the main illegal drug used on a lifetime, recent or current basis in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>Prevalence rates for cannabis were at least twice as high for other illegal drugs; prevalence rates for other illegal drugs were considerably lower than for cannabis across all areas and periods of time. For example, the highest prevalence rate for recent use of ecstasy was 3% and cocaine powder 2%, compared to 8% for cannabis; the profile of illegal drug users showed significant consistency across health boards in almost all areas. Prevalence rates of lifetime, recent and current use were higher among men than women and higher among young people than older people while prevalence rates for sedatives, tranquillisers and anti-depressants were higher among older people and women in most areas.</P>
    <P>The research confirms that most people in all regions have never used illegal drugs, even if there are significant regional variations. However, I am aware that the results highlight the fact that drug use is not confined to major cities but is an issue for urban and rural areas. The Government is not in any way complacent about this issue and remains determined to tackle it on several fronts. Through the ongoing implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, the valuable work being done by the local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, and the work commencing by the regional drugs task forces, much is being, and will continue to be, done in future to tackle the drug problem.</P>
    <P>All the local drugs task forces, with the exception of Bray, are implementing their second round of action plans. The Government has allocated or spent approximately &euro;65 million to <Col N="263"/>implement the range of projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997. A further &euro;11.6 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects, most of which are in local drugs task force areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, approximately &euro;72 million has been allocated to support over 450 facility and services projects in local drugs task force areas and the four other urban centres under the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund. This includes an amount of over &euro;13 million which I recently allocated under round II of the fund, over half of which is in respect of capital developments.</P>
    <P>The regional drugs task forces are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas &mdash; as well as the range and level of existing services &mdash; with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. This work will then feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be assessed by the national drugs strategy team in due course. I hope to be in a position to bring recommendations on funding of the plans to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion early next year and that the regional drugs task forces can begin to implement their plans by mid-2005.</P>
    <P>Finally, the publication of the information contained in this bulletin is particularly timely as the mid-term review of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, will commence soon. This valuable information will significantly add to our knowledge and understanding of drug use across the country which is essential in developing appropriate policies for the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 151 together.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission usually adopts a two-stage approach to publication of its review work: a consultation paper, and a report. A consultation paper is intended to form the basis for discussion and, accordingly, the recommendations contained in it are provisional. The Law Reform Commission invites submissions on the provisional recommendations. The submissions received in response to the public consultation stage subsequently inform preparation of the report.</P>
    <P>The review work which is the subject of both questions is at the first stage: the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper on the court poor box on 30 March 2004, with a deadline for submissions of 31 August 2004. The consultation paper is available on the commission&rsquo;s website, <i>www.lawreform.ie </i>and, in accordance with the usual practice, the <Col N="265"/>recommendations which it contains are provisional.</P>
    <P>The principal provisional recommendations might be summarised as follows: replacement of the current court poor box system, which has been developed by judges as a common law power over many centuries and is not regulated by any legislation, by a statutory scheme, the court charity fund disposition, to be available in the District and Circuit Courts in appropriate cases; where the court does not record a conviction, availability of the court charity fund disposition in respect of summary offences only, subject to a prescribed list of factors; a ceiling, at the limit of the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts, on the maximum amount payable to the court charity fund; application of the funds generated by the replacement scheme for the benefit only of trusts for the relief of poverty, trusts for the advancement of education or religion and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community to be excluded from the scope of application.</P>
    <P>As a guide only to the shape of the proposed reform, the consultation paper contains in appendix a draft scheme of the court charity fund Bill, updating and amending as appropriate various Acts under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, and the Criminal Justice Act 1993.</P>
    <P>The core provisional recommendation to replace the court poor box system by a statutory scheme, together with key features of such a new scheme as proposed in the consultation paper, would be matters for consideration in the first instance by, amongst others, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Courts Service, the Judiciary, the Revenue Commissioners and the National Crime Council. Any eventual decision arising would be a matter for Government in the context of approving proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the administration of any funds raised by a new statutory scheme, the consultation paper indicates that one possibility would be to recommend that such a separate fund be established within an appropriate Department, for example, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. However, the Law Reform Commission recognises that this is uncharted territory, and as such submissions on the administration and distribution of such funds, and in particular the appropriate body to be designated responsible for this role, are welcome.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Deputies find this information helpful, pending publication later in the year by the Law Reform Commission of its report, which will set out definitive recommendations, <Col N="266"/>developed with the benefit of submissions made in response to the public consultation under way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 161, 170, 171 and 839 together.</P>
    <P>In future the RAPID programme will operate on several levels in tandem. In the first instance, there are many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans that have been sent unnecessarily to Departments for consideration, when they could be dealt with more effectively at local level. I am introducing a new delivery mechanism to progress such actions, supported by a new dedicated fund of &euro;4.5 million in 2004. These projects will be co-funded by the relevant local agency etc. under several categories, with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.</P>
    <P>In addition, &euro;2 million is being provided for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme. This scheme will be operated by local authorities and funded on a euro for euro basis, with &euro;1 million from my Department and &euro;1 million from the local authorities through the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Projects to be supported will be selected by the local authorities in consultation with the area implementation teams.</P>
    <P>The maximum cost per project will be &euro;50,000. Funding of 45% of project cost is available from my Department. A further 45% is being provided from local authority internal capital receipts and local authorities must provide an additional 10% from their own revenue resources. The types of works eligible for funding include environmental works, landscaping, paving, development of open spaces, seating areas, lighting and boundary walls.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and area implementation teams were notified of their allocations last week as shown in the table.</P><Col N="267"/>

    <P>Funding of &euro;3 million is being provided to support the development of playgrounds in RAPID areas. My Department is providing &euro;1.5 million and the Department of Health and Children has made a further &euro;1.5 million available to my Department. The scheme aims to provide for new playgrounds or for the refurbishment of existing playgrounds in designated RAPID areas. The local authority, in consultation with the relevant area implementation team, will select the projects to <Col N="268"/>be supported. Details of the operation of this scheme are being finalised.</P>
    <P>I also intend to allocate top-up funding to successful projects from RAPID areas under the sports capital programme and &euro;1.5 million has been set aside for this purpose. It is expected that the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism will announce the allocations under the programme soon and I will then consider top-up funding to successful projects from RAPID areas. Other programmes are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that Departments will continue to consider larger projects from RAPID plans for allocations from funding streams within each Department. Departments will deal with fewer <Col N="269"/>projects and will be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions.</P>
    <P>Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue, as this is an important component of the RAPID programme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have informed the House on many occasions, I am aware of the evidence of an increase in the prevalence of cocaine use, particularly through the local drugs task forces and the research done by the national advisory committee on drugs.</P>
    <P>Initial results from the 2002-03 drug prevalence survey, which looked at the overall national position, and were launched last October showed that 3.1% of the population aged between 15 and 64 years have ever used cocaine, 1.1% used it in the last 12 months and 0.3% used in the last month. Similar results for the 15-34 age group show slightly higher usage: 4.8% have ever used cocaine, 2% have used in the last year and 0.7% reported usage in the last month. Compared with similar surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that use in Ireland is close to the average.</P>
    <P>Bulletin 2 of the survey was launched last week and contains data by health board area. The figures show that prevalence of all drugs varies considerably across the country, although there appears to be a higher prevalence in the east and particularly in the ERHA region. The figures for the prevalence of cocaine in the three ERHA health boards are: in the East Coast Area Health Board, 10.5% of those surveyed in the 15 to 34 age group reported ever using cocaine, 4.4% reported usage in the last year and 0.6% reported using cocaine in the last month.</P>
    <P>In the Northern Area Health Board, 7.7% of those surveyed in the 15 to 34 age group reported ever using cocaine, 3.6% reported using in the last year and 1.6% reported using cocaine in the last month. In the South Western Area Health Board, 7.3% of those surveyed in the 15 to 34 age group reported ever using cocaine, 2.1% reported using in the last year and 1.1% reported usage in the last month. The bulletin does not contain any mention of a cocaine prevalence rate, in any area, of 41%.</P>
    <P>The numbers presenting for treatment of cocaine related problems, according to the most recent figures available, remain very low and make up approximately 1% of the overall number. Garda authorities advise me that there are indications of an increase in the availability and use of cocaine. However, offences involving cocaine still represent a small proportion of the overall number of drug offences annually, approximately 5.5% of all such offences, according to the most recent Garda annual <Col N="271"/>report. The increase seems to coincide with an increase in the availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally, as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, and a consequential drop in the street price.</P>
    <P>Through implementing the 100 actions in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces and the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each local drugs task force has an action plan to tackle drug use in its area based on its identified priorities. These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs including cocaine. Most drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, projects should be able to address this pattern rather than concentrate on one drug to the exclusion of others. Since 1997, the Government has allocated or spent over &euro;65 million to implement the projects under the two rounds of task force plans.</P>
    <P>Regional drug task forces have been established in each health board area throughout the country. Where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in their forthcoming regional actions plans. The young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund is doing valuable preventative work. The fund aims to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities, programmes and activities that will divert them away from the dangers of drug misuse. Over &euro;72 million has been allocated under the fund to support in the region of 450 facility and services projects. It is vital that we continue to invest in facilities and services in areas worst affected by drugs if we are to stop the flow of young people into a life of addiction.</P>
    <P>There is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services, such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. The three area health boards of the ERHA have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the matter of cocaine use under review. Furthermore, the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>Finally, over recent months I have visited several local drugs task force areas and discussed with community representatives and others the nature of the drug problem in their areas, including the issue of cocaine. I have asked the national drugs strategy team to consider how best <Col N="272"/>to develop proposals to help address this issue at a local level.</P>

    <P>The national alcohol policy, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children who is pursuing several initiatives in this area. The national drugs strategy calls for increased links between both policies in terms of cross-representation on the relevant committees and working groups to ensure complementarity between the different measures being taken. This is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any plans at present to merge the alcohol and drugs policies. Furthermore, such a proposal would require careful consideration given that different policy responses are required for legal and illegal substances.</P>

	<P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 provides for the establishment of ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that much progress has been made to date in establishing the RDTFs and getting them under-way. They are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas &mdash; as well as the range and level of existing services &mdash; with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. In this context, it should be noted that an amount of <Col N="274"/>&euro;500,000 has been provided by my Department, in the current year, for administrative and technical assistance costs incurred by the RDTFs in their ongoing work.</P>
    <P>The work currently under-way by the RDTFs is likely to take up most of the current year and will then feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be assessed by the National Drugs Strategy Team. I am hopeful that all of this work can be completed by early next year and I will then bring recommendations in relation to the funding of the plans to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
    <P>I expect the RDTFs to be in a position to begin the implementation of their plans by mid-2005. The question of publishing the plans will be a matter for the individual health boards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 146 together.</P>
    <P>The issue of staff retention and motivation in today&rsquo;s dynamic employment market is one which many organisations across all sectors must face.</P>
    <P>Community and voluntary sector organisations are autonomous and, in the context of the resources available to them, assess their own needs and priorities, with the role of the State as that of enabler. While I have no formal role in establishing the terms and conditions of employment operating in the community and voluntary sector, I am keen to see that best practices in recruitment and employment are followed by the sector, especially when supported by core funding from the State. Where such support is provided, my Department would normally require that such best practice is followed. For example, under the community development programme there are a number of professional support agencies whose role is to advise individual projects with regard to their responsibilities in the area of, among other things, employment law, legal issues and general good <Col N="275"/>practice. This expertise has led to a high awareness within the programme with regard to fair and equitable treatment of staff. Jobholders normally hold specific qualifications relative to the particular post and tend to receive salaries commensurate with qualifications and experience levels. Although salary scales are not set within the programme, each funded project is an independent entity, most projects offer incremental salary scales and pension provision as part of the employment contract.</P>
    <P>It is important that our community and voluntary sector remains an attractive and vibrant workplace and continues to attract talented people. The recommendations in the report will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing relationship with the sector.</P>

	<P>The review of ADM carried out by INDECON is part of the broader tri-ministerial review of community and local development structures. The report noted that the context in which ADM now operates has changed significantly since its inception &mdash; in particular a shift from EU to Exchequer funding &mdash; and identified accountability issues arising from current structures. The report also proposed options to address these issues.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the report and that ADM should be restructured to better reflect the context and priorities that now obtain. I have been in communication with ADM and the board has confirmed its willingness to co-operate fully in the process of change arising from the Government decision. At present and as first steps, arrangements are being made to have three additional board members nominated by the Government.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 140, 843 and 844 together.</P>
    <P>The rural social scheme aims to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities by harnessing the skills and talents available among low income farmers and fishermen and provide income support to low income farmers and fishermen who are in receipt of specified, primarily long-term social welfare payments. I envisage that the arrangements for the scheme will be put in place during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In my reply to Questions Nos. 122, 133, 171 and 196 on 9 March, I referred to the LEADER groups, and in Gaeltacht areas, an alignment of such groups with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as well positioned bodies to deliver the programme locally. That is still my view. Practical arrangements, including the administration and payment systems will be addressed in the context of guidelines for the scheme which are currently being finalised.</P>

    <P>I am not opposed to the development of a national Irish language strategy. I recently announced the setting up of an Irish language advisory committee whose terms of reference include &ldquo;the advisability of preparing a 20 year strategic plan with realistic goals for the Irish language in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have set out in my reply to Questions Nos. 124 and 125 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper further details in relation to the establishment of this committee. This is a significant initiative by me in regard to development of future policy with regard to the long term promotion of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to Questions Nos. 104 and 129 regarding the Official Languages Act 2003 &mdash; one of the most important initiatives, in my opinion, towards the promotion of the language for the past number of years. This Act will provide citizens with the opportunity to avail of a better standard of public services through the Irish language in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that through Foras na Gaeilge, my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North fosters and promotes the language on an all-island basis by supporting, financially and otherwise, those concerned with this work.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 137, 158 and 847 together.</P>
    <P>I introduced the CL&Aacute;R programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. The agreed programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CL&Aacute;R programme and I announced these on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties are now included in the programme and there are no plans for any further review of the boundary of CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>
    <P>CL&Aacute;R funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments are made, not on the basis of &ldquo;plans&rdquo;, as referred to by the Deputy, but through a series of measures, over 20 in all, that support physical, economic and social infrastructure such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village, housing and schools enhancement, health, broadband and sports and community projects. The measures reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the start of the programme. The projects under each measure are generally selected or recommended by the relevant Departments, State agencies, Leader groups and local authorities in consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>All the 18 CL&Aacute;R regions are benefiting under a variety of these measures. It is not possible to detail these, but I will send the information to the Deputies shortly. The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem <Col N="282"/>with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CL&Aacute;R areas. I intend to continue this practice for any new measures I may introduce, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.</P>
    <P>The merits of this practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. Expenditure amounted to &euro;14.14 million in 2002 and to &euro;8.613 million in 2003 which, it is estimated, levered out a further &euro;21 million in related public and private expenditure in those two years into the areas which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. The provision in the Estimates for 2004 is &euro;13.49 million, a 57% increase in the 2003 outturn, which will enable the continuation of investment under existing measures of the programme and provide scope for the introduction of such new measures as may be identified during the year.</P>
    <P>With the ongoing co-operation of other Departments, State agencies and public utilities, CL&Aacute;R will continue to deliver on the commitment of supporting rural communities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 173 together.</P>
    <P>I consulted my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the preparation of the national spatial strategy prior to its publication, in particular in regard to rural planning. I said in my statement of 4 March last, welcoming the publication of the draft guidelines, that they represent a practical and thorough approach to the issue of rural housing.</P>
    <P>The document, Consultation Draft of Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing, reflects exactly what I have been saying for the past number of years in regard to this issue. They provide a detailed framework which sets out how Government policy on rural housing, as set out in the national <Col N="284"/><?oasys _fc?>spatial strategy is to be taken forward by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are based on a presumption that people who have roots in or links to rural areas and are part of and contribute to the rural community will get planning permission for houses, provided they meet the normal requirements in regard to matters such as road safety and proper disposal of waste water.</P>
    <P>I have frequently been accused of wanting a free-for-all on the rural housing issue but I repeat that what is needed is rural housing within the confines of good planning practice. The consultation draft reflects my position on this issue and it clearly outlines Government policy on the matter.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are intended to apply to all rural areas, not just in CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>

	<P>The interdepartmental committee for the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language was established in 1997 in recognition of the need to co-ordinate the provision of my Department&rsquo;s service delivery with those of other Departments and bodies. In its initial stages, the committee frequently met in full session. However, in later years it was felt that it was more efficient to organise bilateral meetings with the various Ministers and most of <Col N="285"/>the achievements of the committee were brought about subsequently on a bilateral basis. These include: a special rate of car tax for cars kept permanently on the islands; an increase in the remote area boarding grant for island children attending school on the mainland; the introduction of an islander allowance payable in respect of certain categories of social welfare benefits; input from my Department with regard to legislation affecting the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, Planning and Development Act, Education Act; the co-ordination of marine works in the Gaeltacht; agreement with regard to the unique role of my Department in the development of sports and recreational facilities in the Gaeltacht; and provision of health services on islands.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to pursue specific issues of importance to Gaeltacht and island communities, as well as matters concerning the Irish language, through this forum, in particular on a bilateral basis with the Ministers and Departments concerned.</P>

	<P>As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, a replacement scheme for the student summer job scheme was never proposed. Rather it was anticipated that partnerships and community groups throughout the country would offer practical assistance and support to students in finding temporary summer employment in the labour market as required.</P>
    <P>Such supports are by their nature local and informal. Therefore, it is not feasible to accurately quantify the extent to which these supports have contributed to students finding summer employment.</P>

    <P>On 1 January 2004, my Department assumed responsibility from Comhairle for the provision of funding to Focus Ireland, Tallaght Volunteer Bureau and Volunteering Ireland to support their work in relation to volunteering. Volunteering is also supported via my Department&rsquo;s funding schemes under the White Paper on the Voluntary Sector and by way of the programme of grants for locally-based organisations in the community and voluntary sector. In addition, my Department supports a number of local volunteering bureaux through the local development programme.

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the aim of the young persons facilities and services fund, established by the Government in 1998, is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities, programmes and activities that will divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The main areas being targeted under the fund are the 14 local task force areas of Dublin, Bray and Cork, where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. However, recognising that the drug problem is not confined to the local drugs task force areas, funding was <Col N="287"/>also allocated to a number of urban areas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. A separate allocation was also made to assist a number of voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit, which have the capacity to deliver targeted education and prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>To date, over &euro;72 million has been allocated under the fund to support in the region of 450 facility and services projects. This amount includes the &euro;13 million worth of allocations which I recently announced for over 100 round II proposals. Through the new funding being allocated, a number of new dedicated youth and community centres will be built and a wide and diverse variety of youth work projects across the 14 drugs task force areas will be supported. Substantial funding is also being made available towards the staffing and operational costs of a number of larger community/youth centres built under round I of the fund. There are no plans at present to extend the young persons facilities and services fund to other areas.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 156 and 159 together.</P>
    <P>Following in part from the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which identified certain legal issues relevant to the provision of transport services to the islands, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003 was enacted last year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Act is, firstly, to consolidate previously existing legislative powers held by the Minister in relation to the provision of transport to the islands and, secondly, to address the provision of airstrips on the islands and of connecting bus passenger services as part of certain ferry/air contracts.</P>
    <P>As a division dealing with such matters was already in place, the enactment of the legislation has not occasioned significant change in administrative structures within my Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to formal contracts with island ferry operators, the position is that my officials have been in regular consultation with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor over the past number of months and have recently received from that office a draft generic contract to be used for all new ferry service agreements entered into by my Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of formal contracts with ferry operators providing services, which incorporate road transport links, the position is that, arising from the new legislative provisions in this regard, my Department is in the preliminary stages of preparing draft regulations. These regulations, which will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, will set down the agreed destinations for connecting bus passenger services and will form the basis for entering into formal contracts in these particular cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of ensuring best practice in relation to the award of subsidised island ferry contracts, the Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the need for formal contracts, with enforceable performance clauses, to cover all the subsidised travel services to the islands. Since the publication of that report, my Department has taken steps to ensure that providers formally sign up to the requirements and responsibilities attaching to the provision of subsidised services. In addition, the legal issue arising in relation to the jurisdiction of the Minister to require the provision of supporting bus transport for certain services has been addressed through the enactment of the legislation referred to above.</P>
    <P>As part of its wider response to the report&rsquo;s findings, my Department has secured the support of external expert advice to review and validate tendering processes; strengthened provisions in contract documents, including the signing of a declaration so as to ensure disclosure of breaches <Col N="289"/>of any law generally and to ensure contractors&rsquo; financial and professional suitability; and required all staff involved in the tendering process to be subject to the Ethics Acts or other appropriate form of disclosure. In addition, issues in regard to the optimal duration and terms and conditions of contracts are addressed in a report carried out recently by consultants Malachy Walsh and Partners for my Department, the recommendations of which I am currently considering. A copy of this study is posted on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>

     <Quest>the progress made by his Department in relation to the decentralisation of its staff; if he has undertaken a survey of staff which indicates the number willing to decentralise; when this can be expected to begin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the progress of decentralisation in any Department is guided by the overall implementation process being carried out by the central implementation group. Significant progress has been achieved within my Department to date.</P>
    <P>A dedicated decentralisation unit has been set up to manage the programme. This unit has prepared an information pack, which includes a wide range of information on 17 towns in the area surrounding Knock Airport, as well as Na Forbacha and Clifden. The unit issues regular bulletins to the staff with all the up-to-date information available on decentralisation.</P>
    <P>A departmental decentralisation committee has been established to steer the decentralisation process within the Department. Membership of the committee is made up of senior management and staff. In addition, a liaison officer has been appointed to facilitate communication between the Department of Finance and my Department.</P>
    <P>Special meetings of the partnership committee are held to specifically address issues arising from <Col N="292"/>decentralisation. There is also regular communication between the Department and staff associations through the departmental council process.</P>
    <P>A decentralisation implementation plan for my Department is currently being prepared. Matters which will come within the framework of this plan include: job analysis and process mapping for each function within my Department; induction and training schedules for transferring staff; planning for phased transfer of staff; provision of appropriate office accommodation in each location; logistics; and risk assessment</P>
    <P>No survey of staff has been carried out as yet to ascertain the level of interest in decentralisation. The CAF system, as announced in the Flynn report, will carry out this task on a Civil Service wide basis. It is expected that the system will to be available on-line by the end of May to allow staff to register their preferences and that an analysis of the information ascertained will be available by the end of June. My Department will then, subject to such arrangements as are agreed centrally, be in a position to proceed with the next phase of the decentralisation process.</P>

	<P>The 45 RAPID areas were selected on the basis of objective criteria and neither Clones nor Castleblaney were among the areas identified. There are no plans at present to increase the number of RAPID areas.</P>
    <P>As regards CL&Aacute;R, An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CL&Aacute;R programme and I announced these on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties, including the six Border counties, are now included in the programme. There are no plans at present for any further review of the boundary of CL&Aacute;R areas.</P>

The maximum expenditure per school is &euro;10,000, with CL&Aacute;R and the Department of Education <Col N="294"/>and Science funding 75% of the cost supplemented by a 25% contribution from local sources. One hundred and ninety seven projects, at a total cost of over &euro;1.1 million in 132 schools will be funded under phase 1 of the scheme.

	<P>The Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board, IAB, is a consultative committee of the National Standards <Col N="296"/>Authority of Ireland, NSAI, established under section 10 of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996. It deals with certification of building products, processes or systems for fitness for purpose. The IAB does not employ staff directly. Staff working in the agr&eacute;ment division of the NSAI are employed by both NSAI and Forf&aacute;s. In 1999 the number of staff working in the agr&eacute;ment division was two. In 2000 this number was raised to three and it is envisaged that the number working in the area will be raised to six in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There are 169 products approved or certified by the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board for products, systems or processes. A comprehensive list of its products is to be found on the NSAI website, <i>www.nsai.ie</i>, along with a range of information on the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board.</P>

	<P>In 2001 the National Standards Authority of Ireland commissioned a study on agr&eacute;ment in Ireland. This study was conducted by Fitzpatricks Associates, consultants. As part of the study, there was broad consultation with various groups including client companies, IBEC, Government Departments and Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board management and staff. Arising from the report, the NSAI decided at its board meeting in September 2003 to approve an action plan for agr&eacute;ment.</P>
    <P>Due to the lack of effectiveness of the surveillance system operated by the IAB in recent years, site audits were suspended with a view to re-engineering the processes involved. As part of the action plan, the management of the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board has commenced a pilot study of the requirements of surveillance for waste water treatment systems and the first pilot audit has now taken place. Under the plan, a review of the pilot audit will take place shortly and thereafter a system will be put in place to ensure effective surveillance audits. The number of planned surveillance audit days of certified companies in 2004 is 70.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 182, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The current legislative provisions relating to the appointment, examination etc., of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road are set out in the European Communities (Safety Advisers for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 6 of 2001). These regulations transpose: Council Directive 96/35/EC of 3 June 1996 on the appointment and vocational qualification of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway; and Directive 2000/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2000 on minimum examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations and directives, a safety adviser for the transport of dangerous goods must hold an EU certificate of training as a safety adviser. The regulations and directives also lay down the minimum examination requirements for the examination needed to obtain such a certificate. Article 6 of Directive 96/35/EC, relating to the validity of the certificate, provides that:</P>
    <P LI="1">The certificate shall be valid for five years. The period of validity of a certificate shall be extended automatically for five years at a time where, during the final year before its expiry, its holder has followed refresher courses or <Col N="298"/>passed an examination both of which must be approved by the competent authority.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is transposed in Ireland through Regulation 7(12) of the 2001 regulations, which provides that:</P>
    <P LI="1">Where the holder of a training certificate can show to the competent authority concerned, that within the 12 month period which precedes the expiry of the validity of the certificate referred to in paragraph (11) or of any extension of it given under this paragraph, he or she has passed an examination which has been approved by the competent authority, the period of validity of that certificate shall be extended by the competent authority for a further period of 5 years.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have no proposals currently to alter the existing requirements and I do not envisage changing those requirements in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority, the national competent authority in Ireland for the regulations, that it is considered too onerous to require training for safety advisers every two years, particularly in light of the decision in October 2003 by the joint meeting of the RID safety committee, international rail transport, and the working party on the transport of dangerous goods, which works under the auspices of the UN-ECE, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and which takes decisions on the amendments to the international agreements ADR-RID-AND, on the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways respectively.</P>
    <P>That unanimous decision, to which all member states of the EU were party, decided that revalidation of safety adviser certificates would be by examination every five years and that such examinations would be approved by the relevant competent authority in each member state. This position will be reflected in the 2005 edition of the ADR, which will become applicable from 1 January 2005, with a six-month transition period. A memorandum on the matter of acceding to the ADR is being prepared by my Department and will be submitted to Government by the Department of Foreign Affairs later this year.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the recently published report by Comhl&aacute;mh, Beyond Cancun &mdash; EU Agricultural Trade Policy and the Majority World. It will contribute to the broadening of the debate on agricultural trade policy and the impact <Col N="299"/>of these policies on the development dimensions of the current trade round.</P><?oasys _cl11.6-?>
    <P>The EU commenced an internal reflection period with key stakeholders including the EU member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament to review the DDA negotiations in the aftermath of the failed Cancun Conference. The European Commission communication which issued, following the conclusion of this period of reflection, in November 2003 notified the approach to reviving the DDA negotiations from the EU perspective. In it there is clear emphasis on the need for the reintegration of developing countries into the world economy as a necessary condition for development, and that such integration will be deeper and fairer if anchored in the multilateral trading system.</P>
    <P>The strategy and approach notified in the Commission communication across the full spectrum of DDA negotiating issues was endorsed by the EU Council of Ministers in December 2003. The EU Council encouraged the European Commission, on its behalf, to actively engage with our WTO trading partners aimed at the immediate re-launch of the DDA negotiations and stated that the &ldquo;Union give priority to the achievement of real benefits in the short term to the poorest countries through rapid progress on issues of importance to them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The EU, therefore, is committed to work hard to secure genuinely pro-development outcomes in all areas of the Doha work programme, in line with the stress placed on this in earlier Council conclusions. Action to achieve these outcomes are those identified in the September 2002 Communication on Trade and Development, endorsed by the EU Council, including in the areas of market access, multilateral; trade rules, trade-related assistance and capacity building, including the mainstreaming of trade-related assistance into poverty reduction strategy papers, and similar strategies.</P>
    <P>I again welcome Comhl&aacute;mh report and its contribution to the debate which will be considered in the context of the strategies and approach to achieve the desired objectives across the full spectrum of DDA sectors, including in relation to agricultural trade policy. In that context, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, as President of the Agriculture Council, intends to hold a debate at the informal Ministers meeting in Ireland in May on how the impact of CAP reform on international trade as well as opportunities arising from existing and future international arrangements can best be communicated to the EU&rsquo;s trading partners and, in particular, developing countries. EU trade policy is a community competence. As such a <Col N="300"/>common EU approach is developed and formulated in the evolution of the common commercial policy of the Union.</P>

	<P>It should be noted that my Department does not discriminate, positively or negatively, between nationals of the various non-EEA countries. Any work permit granted in respect of personnel from outside the expanded EU is granted on the basis of the skills, experience and qualifications of the person in question. My Department is satisfied from experience in recent years that the great bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas labour needs can be met from within the enlarged EU. However, exceptionally skilled, highly paid employees can still be sourced from the wider world after May 2004. Policies adopted by other member states of the European Union in respect of the issue of work permits are a matter for the Governments of those states.</P>

In addition, this report lists a number of recommendations that the group would like to see implemented. The concerns of the Finglas Anti-Cuts Action Group and other sponsor organisations are being considered in the context of the overall review of CE and job initiative currently being undertaken by a group of senior officials and F&Aacute;S. The outcome of this review will inform any future adjustments in the structure and the terms and conditions of participation on community employment.</P>

	<P>The correspondence referred to raised the question of whether or not non-EEA nationals carrying out a course of studies in Ireland, and in possession of a student visa to do so, would require a work permit if they wished to take up periods of full-time employment in Ireland. My Department issued a response, and had a subsequent meeting with the college in question, both of which clarified the point that non-EEA nationals in Ireland on student visas are entitled to work 20 hours per week and 40 hours per week during vacation periods. However, they are not entitled to take up periods of full-time employment during their studies in the absence of an employment permit.</P>

	<P>There is a long-standing arrangement, agreed in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whereby non-EEA postgraduate medical students may take up employment in the State without requiring a work permit to do so, providing the work is an integral part of their studies. It is very important to note that this concession only applies to non-EEA nationals who are undertaking a course of recognised postgraduate studies at a recognised third level institution in Ireland. It does not, however, apply to non-EEA nationals studying in Ireland who may happen to already possess a postgraduate qualification in their home country.</P>

	<P>The figures for the number of work days that were lost in 2003 are compiled by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and are expected to be available later this year.</P>
    <P>In 2002, 3.156 million work days were lost due to work-related injuries and illnesses. It should be noted that this figure is calculated on the basis of those in employment, those unemployed and those not in the labour force. The figure related to those in employment is 1.286 million work days lost. An analysis of these figures, including an economic sector breakdown, is set out in tables 1 and 2. These figures have been obtained through the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, conducted by the CSO. There are no comparable figures available for years prior to 2002 as the questionnaire used by the CSO has changed compared to previous versions.</P><Col N="301"/>

	<P>Responsibility for the retail planning guidelines lies with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is currently reviewing the operation of the guidelines in so far as they relate to non-food outlets.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to review the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 and the ban on below cost selling contained therein. To date, I have received a large amount of correspondence in the matter from interested parties. I have also met a number of these parties. As Minister with responsibility for consumer welfare, I must, in considering the views of those who advocate retaining the order in its current form, balance those views with the need to ensure that the interests of consumers are best served. I will take the views of all interested parties into consideration before making any decision in relation to the order.</P>

     <Quest>the reason IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland have not been able to get industrialists into the <Col N="304"/>new advanced factory on the Dunmore Road in Tuam; the amount of money that has been spent to date on the project; if there are ongoing discussions with interested parties for the provision of badly needed jobs in the hub town of Tuam; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day to day operational matter for the agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas for industrial development and it is not a role in which I have a direct function. I understand from IDA Ireland that the new advanced factory, to which the Deputy refers, has not yet been built. Planning permission was recently obtained for the factory, which is to be located on a new 27 acre business and technology park on the Dunmore Road, Tuam, involving an investment to date of circa &euro;3.5 million. In light of a shift in client needs, IDA Ireland is currently reviewing the building&rsquo;s design in order to ensure that the most up-to-date and suitable facility for attracting new industries is realised.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies Enterprise Ireland, EI, and IDA Ireland are fully committed to the development of Tuam, which has been designated as a hub town in the national spatial strategy and is, therefore, very much a priority area for these agencies to develop. The agencies are actively promoting Tuam for new investment on an ongoing basis, with IDA Ireland seeking out foreign direct investment through its network of overseas offices and EI concentrating on the development of indigenous industries in the town. The new 27 acre park will significantly enhance the attractiveness of the Tuam area as a potential location for industry, <Col N="305"/>and is an added selling point in the respective strategies of IDA Ireland and EI in their promotion of Tuam to potential investors at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional investment and jobs for the people of Tuam.</P>

	<P>My Department was formally notified of the proposed redundancy of the person concerned on 17 December 2003, when statutory form RP1, notice of proposed redundancy, was submitted in respect of that person. No further documentation has been submitted.</P>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003, the Department has a responsibility to ensure that all eligible employees receive their correct statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement. From the information received on form RP1 it appears that the employee concerned fulfils the necessary criteria for a statutory redundancy payment. In the event of the employer failing to make this payment, the Department will make the payment from the social insurance fund, on receipt of the necessary documentation, and will then endeavour to recoup the money from the employer. Information on this matter can be obtained from employment rights information section of the Department &mdash; telephone (01) 6313131 or Lo-Call 1890 201615 &mdash; or from redundancy payments section &mdash; telephone (01) 6312121 or Lo-Call 1890 220222. In addition, my Department has now sent the person concerned a copy of the recently updated guide to the redundancy payments scheme which fully explains the scheme in a user friendly manner.</P>

     <Quest>the action she intends to take to secure jobs in the printing industry; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in excess of &euro;350 million worth of printing is being outsourced to other EU countries, principally the UK, in which the rate of VAT on such services is considerably lower than the rate here; if she has had discussions with the Irish Printing Federation in respect of the haemorrhaging of jobs in this important sector of the economy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The Irish paper, <Col N="306"/>print and packaging sector comprises approximately 600 companies. It employs in the region of 18,000 people and has estimated sales of &euro;1.6 billion per annum. However, over-capacity in the sector has resulted in rationalisation and consolidation. A number of companies have downsized and closed and further rationalisation is expected. Outsourcing is likely to continue to be an option for parts of the manufacturing process.</P>
    <P>In June, 2002, the print industry training and development forum was established and, for the first time ever, all the participants in the paper, print and packaging industry came together to respond to a rapidly changing environment. The purpose of the forum was to represent and promote the needs of its members in order to move the industry towards international best practice. State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, are represented on the forum. The Irish Printing Federation is a member of the forum and issues relating to levels of imports and VAT have been brought to the forum by the federation. In addition, Enterprise Ireland meets the federation on a quarterly basis.</P>
    <P>The VAT rates on printed matter were reviewed in the 1998 Finance Act. I understand that the intention at the time was to simplify the rating structure and to extend the lower rates as much as EU obligations would allow. I am informed that under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT and we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991. However, all printed booklets are zero-rated for VAT purposes and the lower rate includes a wide range of printed matter such as newspapers, periodicals, brochures, leaflets, etc. I understand that the UK has similar zero rating provisions but for a wider range of printed matter. Overall, I would not be convinced that the VAT differential is the solution to the issue of outsourcing. The printing industry, along with other manufacturing industries, is facing competitive international pressures.</P><?oasys _cl11-?>
    <P>As regards the print sector generally, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s primary objective is to develop additional export sales and to establish overseas market presence. In terms of jobs, activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies and the retention and creation of jobs in existing companies. Research is also supported in companies and third level institutions. Enterprise Ireland will continue to focus its support on key areas that address the needs of clients in both the print and packaging sectors.</P>
    <P>F&Aacute;S, in association with Enterprise Ireland and employers and unions within the industry, has undertaken a study of the paper and printing industry. The report, which is due to be completed by September 2004, will provide a strategic analysis of the current competitive position of the industry and will include a range of recommendations on the development of <Col N="307"/>appropriate business models and skills sets for the sector.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
    <P>The Department had no role relating to any such contract as referred to and would suggest that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources be contacted directly on this issue.</P>
    <P>Day to day responsibility for the administration and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation, including the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act 1987 and the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991, made under that Act, rests with the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>Regulation 13(1) of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991 requires that &ldquo;there shall be on hand at all times, except when prevailing weather and climatic conditions may endanger the crew, passengers or vessels, in the neighbourhood of every offshore installation a suitably equipped vessel, to be known and in these Regulations referred to as a &rdquo;stand-by <Col N="308"/>vessel&ldquo;, prepared to render immediate assistance in the event of an emergency on, in, at or about the said installation or involving persons working from the said installation&rdquo;. Regulation 13(3) refers to the positioning of a stand-by vessel and Regulation 13(5) requires a stand-by vessel to have adequate accommodation for all persons who may be on an offshore installation at any time and to be adequately equipped to provide medical treatment in an emergency.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority that the company referred to owns two fixed production platforms-installations in the Kinsale Head gas field, which are located three nautical miles from each other and are approximately 30 nautical miles form Roches Point lighthouse. Since December 2001, one of these platforms has become what is termed as a &ldquo;normally unmanned installation&rdquo;, NUI, and, therefore, it only presents a risk to personnel when they are on board for maintenance, etc.</P>
    <P>Processing of gas takes place on the platforms, on one of which personnel are located. As a result, a standby vessel is required to render assistance if required in the event of an emergency. I am informed that the company currently has a contract for two full-time vessels &mdash; one standby vessel and one support vessel. The standby vessel serves the two platforms. The support vessel is also certified and equipped to be a standby vessel. Its normal activity is to bring cargo in and out of port but it also acts a relief standby vessel when the main standby vessel goes into port to change crew. Standby boats have crew, medical supplies, medic or paramedic, and other supplies on board and two rescue boats attached.</P>
    <P>The company has recently tendered to have a single self-relieving dual purpose standby-supply boat vessel. I am informed that there will be one certified standby vessel which will also be capable of carrying supplies and cargo. When a crew change is needed at a platform &mdash; normally every two to three weeks &mdash; a temporary certified standby boat will come out from port and replace the original standby vessel while it goes into port to change crew and get supplies. This temporary standby boat will be certified to be a standby vessel. I am informed that this arrangement will satisfy Regulation 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991, as at all times there will be a certified stand-by vessel in the vicinity of both platforms.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference to &ldquo;the requirement that no supply vessel can be considered a stand-by vessel when it is actively engaged in heavy cargo work, have its rescue area impeded by cargo or is carrying hazardous material&rdquo;, these restrictions are not specifically mentioned in the 1987 Act or 1991 regulations. Notwithstanding that, from a safety point of view, the Health and Safety Authority would recommend as good practice that such restrictions be observed and I <Col N="309"/>am informed that the company has such procedures in place. I am also informed that the company&rsquo;s procedures, when the supply boat-relief boat comes out to the installation to relieve the standby boat that is waiting to go to shore, are that the existing standby boat waiting to be relieved cannot leave the area until the landing area of the deck of the supply boat is clear for potential casualties, that is, until the supply boat has offloaded its deck cargo on to the installation and the deck is clear. Then, the standby boat waiting to be relieved can go back to port, as the relief standby-supply boat is then ready to act as a temporary standby vessel. I am informed that the Health and Safety Authority has no objection to this arrangement and is satisfied that this complies with Regulation 13 of the 1991 regulations, as long as this procedure is maintained at all times and there is one stand-by vessel available with the rescue area clear.</P>
    <P>As regards arrangements in the event of breakdown of the single self-relieving, dual purpose standby-supply boat vessel, I am informed that the following would apply: the standby vessel has spare replacement parts for the vessel on board so the likelihood of the standby vessel being down for long is low; notwithstanding that, each platform has its own self-contained lifeboats capable of reaching Cork harbour on their own; even if the standby vessel breaks down, it has two fast rescue craft it can launch itself which can be at the installation within minutes; and helicopter back-up from Cork Airport or the platform would also be put on a higher state of alert, in the event of a stand-by vessel breakdown.</P>

    <P FLI="0">The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes, namely, CE, job initiative and social economy. F&Aacute;S is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. This allocation, &euro;351 million, is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. Accordingly, there will be no reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels in 2004.</P>
    <P>As provided for in the PPF, consideration has been given to the mainstreaming of certain essential services provided through CE. In this regard, approximately 4,500 CE places in schools have been mainstreamed over the past number of years. This involved the appropriate degree of funding being transferred to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of relevant services in schools. In addition, in the region of 2,300 places have peen provided on the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions took place during 2002 involving the Department of Health and Children, health boards, F&Aacute;S and sponsor groups including the Irish Wheelchair Association, with regard to the possible mainstreaming of health sector places. However, due to the amount of additional funding required by the Department of Health and Children to mainstream these positions, and having regard to other major demands on the health budget, it was not possible to proceed with mainstreaming.</P>
    <P>However, all health service related community employment projects, including those providing services for persons with disabilities, are ring-fenced and protected from reductions. Other services ring-fenced from reductions include drugs task force activity and child-care service provision. Projects in RAPID areas are prioritised. Sponsor organisations, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, have indicated that they have difficulty in replacing participants who <Col N="312"/>have completed their normal term of community employment due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. In this regard, F&Aacute;S has been requested to make every effort to identify community employment participants suitable for the positions in question. Should F&Aacute;S encounter difficulties in replacing CE participants with suitable persons, the matter can be considered in the context of the 20% flexibility in relation to extending community employment participation.</P>
    <P>The future structure of the CE programme remains under review by a group of senior officials and F&Aacute;S. This group will report to Ministers on the outcome of their deliberations shortly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 to 206, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>Following a review by Aer Rianta on behalf of the Department of Defence of policy in relation to safety zones at Casement Aerodrome in 1992, <Col N="314"/>taking account of existing and future technical and operational requirements of the Air Corps, a map showing revised safety and security areas was forwarded to Dublin County Council for incorporation in its development plan which was under review at that time. The map, designated as Map No. 2 which forms part of the report prepared by Aer Rianta and which differs from the map included at page 313 (a) of the 1983 Dublin development plan, shows the extent of the restricted areas and these include areas coloured red at the end of each runway at Casement Aerodrome. Red safety areas, or runway approach surfaces as they are technically referred to, were first adopted at Casement Aerodrome following the Aer Rianta report of 1992 and were introduced to ensure the safe and unobstructed operation of air traffic to and from Casement Aerodrome in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations. While the safety policy has been kept under review in the interim the runway approach surface areas have been retained. The runway approach surfaces at Casement Aerodrome originate 60 metres beyond the runway thresholds, have a width of 300 metres and diverge at a rate of 15% at each side to a width of 700 metres. The overall length of the runway approach surfaces at Casement Aerodrome are 1370 metres long in the case of each runway. The Department&rsquo;s policy approach is that no new developments should be allowed within the runway approach surfaces. However, extensions to existing domestic dwellings are acceptable in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for planning and development in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome now rests with the planning department of South Dublin County Council. The practice down the years has been for the local planning authority to consult the Department of Defence in respect of planning applications for proposed developments which may affect Casement Aerodrome. Such consultations have taken place and continue to take place on a regular basis.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to his questions dated 25 March and 6 April 2004, which related to the impact to date on defence spending of EU defence measures and the anticipated impact on defence spending over the next 10 years by EU defence-related measures and commitments.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my replies, the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, set out a medium term strategy for defence covering the period up to 2010. A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world-class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, both at home and abroad. This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.</P>
    <P>In seeking to modernise the Defence Forces in accordance with the objectives of the White Paper I have been fully conscious of the need to obtain the best possible efficiencies from existing resources, and have reported to the House on many occasions on the methods by which this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage any additional Exchequer requirements for my Department arising from the security strategy.</P>
    <P>Questions on the draft treaty come under the remit of my colleague the Minster for Foreign Affairs and accordingly should be tabled to him.</P>
    <P>Defence and defence policy are a fundamental expression of national sovereignty. In that context, defence spending is a matter for the Government and has to be undertaken in a prudent and balanced fashion having due regard to the prevailing national socio-economic environment.</P>
    <P>I would, yet again, take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that national sovereignty and voluntarism are the fundamental underlying principles of participation in the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. Participation in any specific operation by member states is decided on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with respective national decision making procedures.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>It is presumed that the question refers to Amendment <Col N="316"/>No. 93 to Defence Force Regulations A.15. This amendment came into effect on 14 February 1985.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Amendment No. 93 to Defence Force Regulations A.15 was to amend the provisions of Part IV of the regulation which relates to the appointment of officers with professional qualifications. A number of provisions had become out of date by 1985, for example, they did not take account of the fact that women were eligible for appointment as medical and dental officers, nor of the introduction at that time of a short-service commission scheme for medical officers. It was decided at that time to avail of the opportunity to make various other necessary changes in other parts of the regulations and to delete obsolete provisions which were no longer relevant. The effective date of the provisions of the amendment, 14 February 1985, was the date on which the Minister for Defence signed the draft amendment, following approval being received from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Prior to the amendment, paragraph 18(2) provided that an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces should not be recommended for retirement for misconduct or inefficiency unless or until the officer had been given a reasonable opportunity to make such representations as she or he might think fit in regard to the proposed retirement. Amendment No. 93 to paragraph 18(2) extended these particular provisions to comprehend retirement in the interests of the service.</P>

The matter was the subject of applications to the local authority for planning permission and permission, subject to conditions, has recently been granted in this regard. One of the conditions stipulates that the development must be carried out solely within the property in the ownership of the applicant and that no part of the development shall encroach on the rights of adjoining property owners without prior <Col N="317"/>consent of the relevant owner. Officials of my Department have agreed to meet with the developer in the near future to discuss his proposed development. No commitment, however, has been entered into in regard to the incorporation of any part of the FCA hall, Slievenamon Road, into the development.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the European Council regulation introducing the single payment scheme, a farmer may have access to the scheme if he was an active farmer during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and received payments under the livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes. In addition, farmers for whom entitlements will be established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year. In general, farmers must also have an eligible hectare of land for each payment entitlement.</P>
    <P>Farmers who had leased their holdings during the entire reference period and were not farming will not have any entitlements established for them under the single payment scheme. The person who was leasing the land and was actively farming during the reference years will have the entitlements established. It should be noted that entitlements are attached to the farmer who was actively farming during the reference period and are not attached to the land. I should point out, however, that during the Council negotiations last year I secured agreement that farmers who take over the holding that was leased out to a third party during the reference period, will be able to apply to the National Reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme. This will be of particular benefit to the offspring of farmers who joined the early retirement scheme before the reference period and leased out the farm to a third party.</P>
    <P>Farmers who leased out their holding during or after the reference period, will, because they were active farmers in one or more of the reference years, have entitlements established for them. However, they will need to commence farming again in 2005 and continue to farm in order to activate their entitlements and draw down the single payment for themselves. If they do not return to farming and activate their entitlements the entitlements in question will revert to the National Reserve.</P>
    <P>During the course of negotiations on the detailed rules regulation, Ireland secured agreement that a farmer who was farming during one of more of the reference years and who has since leased out his holding to another farmer can apply in 2005 to establish his entitlements and then lease those entitlements out to the farmer who has leased the land. In order to avail of this provision there must be a lease agreement in place in 2005 which provides that the entitlements are to be leased out to the person who is leasing the land. This provision will also be of particular benefit to farmers who joined the early retirement scheme either during or after the reference period. Such farmers are precluded from taking up farming again in their own right but they will be allowed to request to have their <Col N="320"/>entitlements established whereupon they can then lease out the entitlements to the farmer who is leasing the land provided that the lease agreement in place in 2005 provides for this type of arrangement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comhl&aacute;mh report gives a very detailed analysis of the debate on the needs of developing countries and of the implications for them of policy decisions taken at EU level. I am acutely aware of these needs. I am satisfied that the recent reform of the CAP will be of benefit to developing countries, including ACP countries. Decoupled payments will replace production-related supports, thereby reducing the potential distortion impact of production-related supports.</P>
    <P>Trade with ACP countries is governed by the terms of the ACP-EU partnership which was signed in Cotonou in June 2000 under which the EU grants non-reciprocal trade preferences to imports from ACP countries. In September 2002, the ACP countries and the EU officially launched negotiations on a series of economic partnership agreements which will replace the existing arrangements with reciprocal agreements that are WTO compatible and which will retain an element of differential treatment for the ACP countries. These economic partnership agreements will cover trade in agricultural products. The current preferential trade regime has been extended pending completion of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the EU has recently abolished tariffs and other such restrictions on all products from the 49 poorest countries on the planet &mdash; the least developed countries. This &ldquo;Everything But Arms&rdquo; initiative gives these countries immediate duty and quota free access to the EU market. This includes products such as beef, milk products, fruits and vegetables. A transitional period applies for rice, bananas and sugar, but full liberalisation will be in place by 2009.</P>
    <P>The EU is also prepared to negotiate further special and differentiated treatment for developing countries under a new WTO round. In the context of these WTO talks, the EU is asking that other developed WTO partners provide similar concessions.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement of the EU regulations governing the early retirement from farming schemes that any national retirement pension to which a scheme participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management situation, becomes entitled must be deducted from the early retirement pension. This also means that any increases in national retirement pensions granted in the annual Budget Statement must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
    <P>As this requirement derives from EU Council regulations, it has been a feature of the early retirement from farming schemes since the start of the first scheme in 1994. There has been no recent change in the situation.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the decision of the UK authorities to suspend reactive culling of badgers, following reported indications of an increase in TB in cattle. However, I would point out that such a response to the removal of badgers under the Irish programme has not been observed. In any event, it is not possible to extrapolate the UK position to this country as the ecology of the badger is different here &mdash; in the UK 70% of badger setts are in woodland and 30% in pasture, while the reverse applies in Ireland and the social group size is different.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recent Godfray Review of the randomised culling trial and associated epidemiological research, the response thereto by the independent scientific group on cattle TB and further comments by the Statistical Auditor to the randomised badger culling trials. All of these appear to be at one in their belief that the reactive trials in the UK were suspended prematurely.</P>

	<P>The information requested is not readily available. However, it should be noted that the contribution of afforestation to carbon sequestration uses an averaging approach to take account of differences in rates of carbon emissions and sequestration between mineral and peat soils. Current scientific opinion is that emissions of carbon dioxide from peat following afforestation may be balanced by reductions in emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas which has a far greater effect on global warming.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that planting of peat sites has declined to very low levels since the early 1990s due to a site productivity requirement for grant aid and the general shift to farmer based afforestation.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme recently adopted by my Department for the eradication of scrapie in infected flocks is based on requirements laid down in EU law. It involves genotyping of flocks, retention of scrapie resistant sheep for breeding, disposal of scrapie susceptible sheep and strict controls over purchases into and sales from the flock. I believe that this accelerated &ldquo;breeding for resistance&rdquo; programme for infected flocks will result in long term benefits, both in terms of scrapie resistance and the marketability of their sheep, for farmers whose flocks are affected.</P>
    <P>The package available for such farmers includes free genotyping of the flock, free genotyping of a limited number of replacement rams, live valuation of breeding stock, an <Col N="326"/>additional &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; payment for breeding ewes, and a flat rate payment for factory lambs which, by virtue of their susceptibility to scrapie, are required to be disposed of outside of the human food and animal feed chains. I believe that this is a reasonable, balanced package.</P>
    <P>However, I am at present reflecting on whether a minor adjustment to the flat rate lamb price is warranted, having regard to recent increases in lamb prices and taking into account that any linkage of this rate to current lamb prices will expose affected farmers to troughs in the market as well as peaks.</P>

     <Quest>the impact which the possibility of up to one million acres of extra tillage land becoming available under the new CAP regime will have on the future of farming <Col N="326"/>here; and the way in which this will require a re-evaluation of the strategy outlined in Vision.</Quest>

	<P>The requirement that, in order to draw down the single payment, farmers would have to <Col N="327"/>have 100% of the average land area that they had during the reference period would have resulted in serious problems for certain categories of Irish farmers. For instance, some 56,000 hectares of land has been planted with forestry during the period 2000-03 and quite an amount of land has been acquired under compulsory purchase order by local authorities. In addition, certain farmers who had land rented in or leased in during the reference period may no longer have access to that land. The 100% requirement would therefore have undoubtedly contributed further to an increase in the cost of rented land from 2005 onwards.</P>
    <P>I believe that the detailed rules that I have negotiated are in the best interests of Irish farmers and Irish agriculture. I am satisfied that Irish farmers will continue to farm all utilisable agricultural land as they traditionally have done.</P>
    <P>The strategies and recommendations contained in the Agri-Food 2010 report are being examined in the context of developments since that report was completed. A broadly based group under the chairmanship of Mr. Alan Dukes will address the issues and challenges, including the introduction of the single farm payment, facing the Irish agri-food sector up to 2015.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Bord Bia&rsquo;s comments relate specifically to horticulture and it is clear that there is substantial scope for growth in this sector. Currently the demand for organic fruit and vegetables, even those that can be produced in Ireland, is frequently met by imports. There is a gap in the market that provides an opportunity for farmers willing to consider it, particularly after decoupling when farmers will be able to consider a wider range of options.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>The organic sector in Ireland as a whole remains small, however, in comparison to some other countries in the EU, although it has grown in recent years and sales of organic food were worth &euro;38 million in 2003. Currently there are some 1,000 organic operators registered with my Department, and approximately 30,000 hectares of land are being farmed to organic standards.</P>
    <P>A national steering group, established on foot of a recommendation in the organic development committee report, acts as the driving force for the development of the sector. It also monitors progress on the implementation of the recommendations. As part of the implementation strategy, a draft organic horticultural development plan, prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders, <Col N="329"/>will be presented to the next meeting of the group.</P><?oasys _xh?>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulatory provisions establishing the single payment scheme prohibit the growing of fruit and vegetables on lands declared for aid under the scheme and a farmers decision to diversify to the production of horticultural products on such land will be determined by this fact. However, the horticultural sector has operated outside the direct payment system since its inception and due to the relatively small area of land involved and the specialised nature of the enterprise, the impact of the policy change should have only a limited effect on horticulture output.</P>
    <P>The horticulture sector has undergone considerable change in recent years and has grown to be a significant entity within the overall agriculture industry. Farm gate value, excluding potatoes, increased by some 6% over the past three years from &euro;267 million in 2001 to &euro;283 million in 2003. It is expected that output from the sector will continue to increase to meet the changing demands of the market place and consumer preferences.</P>

     <QRef>[11658/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Research and development work in Teagasc has provided the knowledge to allow growers extend the season of production using protective structures with appropriate cultivars. From this work, together with input from the Teagasc advisory service, the nature of the industry has changed from outdoor field production, subject to the vagaries of the weather, to indoor production which is much more sustainable in our climate. Soft fruit can now be grown from April to November in this country and the volume and value of strawberries, the most important fruit crop, have more than doubled during the last four years. Imports occur mainly at times of the year when Irish fruit is not available. There is also consumer <Col N="330"/>demand for more exotic products which are not grown in Ireland for climatic and economic reasons.</P>
    <P>While the Teagasc soft fruit research centre at Clonroche was closed in September 2003, research work is continuing at other centres and Teagasc is fully committed to continue providing the vital technology services to underpin a competitive Irish soft fruit production sector.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.</P>
    <P>The named person submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship in the 2003-04 milk quota year. However, there was insufficient quota available in the 2003-04 year to enable the tribunal to deal with all applications received and some, including that from the named individual, have been held over for consideration in the 2004-05 quota year. The tribunal will begin dealing with these cases in the autumn and it will not be necessary for the person to make a fresh application.</P>
    <P>The tribunal also considers applications from producers whose herds have been restricted by animal disease, TB or brucellosis, during the quota year.

	<P>Under the European Council regulation introducing the single payment scheme, a farmer may have access to the scheme if he or she was an active farmer during the reference years of 2000, 2001 and 2002 and if he or she received payments under the livestock premia and/or arable aid schemes. In addition, farmers for whom entitlements will be established must activate the entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and by submitting an area aid declaration in that year. In general, farmers must also have an eligible hectare of land for each payment entitlement.</P>
    <P>The person referred to in the question joined the scheme of early retirement from farming in September 1999. Farmers in her situation, who had leased their holdings during the entire reference period and were not farming, will not have any entitlements established for them under the single payment scheme. Persons who were leasing their lands and were active farmers in the reference period will have entitlements established for them. It should be noted that entitlements are attached to the farmer who was actively farming during the reference period and are not attached to the land.</P>
    <P>During the Council negotiations last year I secured agreement that farmers, including the offspring of farmers who retired before the reference period, who take over the holding that was leased out during the reference period at some date in the future will be able to apply to the national reserve for payment entitlements under the single payment scheme.</P>

	<P>On 16 February 2004 I announced that my Department had finalised its review of the national veterinary medicines control regime. I said then that it is appropriate to make a number of changes to the 1996 animal remedies regulations to accommodate not only the IMB report, but also to take account of a range of developments since the legislation was put in place and prospective developments, including at EU level. Developments include amendments to the rules governing prescribing by veterinary surgeons which, <i>inter alia</i>, will enable intramammaries to be brought under a workable and effective prescription control regime, thus giving effect to the key recommendation of the IMB report. It is important to recall that the IMB report on this issue was founded on public health concerns relating to the use of antibiotics and the growth in the human population of anti-microbial resistance, which has implications for health management and the treatment of illnesses.</P>
    <P>My Department has conducted a round of briefing sessions with stakeholders to outline the proposed changes. Consideration is being given to submissions which have been received, following which the animal remedies consultative committee will be convened as required by the relevant legislation to consider the proposed changes.

	<P>Having received the necessary Government approval, my Department is working on drafting an animal health Bill to consolidate and update the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 and sequential legislation. When this work has been brought to an advanced stage the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel will be involved in concluding the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is considering all existing provisions of the Diseases <Col N="335"/>of Animals Act 1966 to determine whether and to what extent they need to be changed. I intend to bring forward legislation that can serve the country well in the years ahead and that will strengthen the means available to the Government to protect and enhance the health status of our herds, flocks, etc. Not only will this entail having the most effective possible legislative means of dealing with real or potential animal disease threats which may emerge, but it also involves providing a modern legislative environment within which good practice in agriculture, livestock farming, animal husbandry, bio-security trading, marketing, etc. can be promoted and supported. Notwithstanding the fact that the provisions of the 1966 Act are being reviewed in the course of drafting the animal health Bill, it will continue to be important to maintain a distinction between dealers and others involved with livestock. I expect to be in a position to publish the animal health Bill early in 2005.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the sixth EU VAT directive and Irish VAT law, primary and secondary level schools and other educational institutions, are exempt from VAT. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they supply, but cannot recover VAT on the goods and services they purchase. Only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT, essentially. It is normal for State funded services, such as schools or hospitals, to bear VAT on their purchases. However, Exchequer funding for such services, including primary and secondary schools, takes account of VAT when allocations are being made by the Government. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the proposed expenditure on science laboratory refurbishment for this year includes &euro;2 million for immediate urgent refurbishment works and &euro;10.5 million for equipment for junior science technology.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. The scheme provides a range of tax reliefs in connection with the purchase and use of vehicles by drivers, passengers and organisations. It is a fundamental requirement for the relief that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. It should be noted that the medical criteria relate, essentially, to disabilities that affect the physical mobility of the person. If the issue of the required certificate is refused, an appeal can be made to the disabled drivers&rsquo; medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
    <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the 1994 disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) regulations. A qualifying person must satisfy one or more of the six types of disablement listed under the regulations. The six types of disablement are persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <Col N="338"/>persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    <P>An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria I have outlined is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of such a certificate provides for remission or repayment of VRT and a repayment of VAT on the purchase of the vehicle and on the cost of adapting the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in replies to previous questions on this issue, an interdepartmental review group has examined the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. I have received the group&rsquo;s report, which is being considered. Any recommendations contained in the report in respect of the medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme will receive full consideration. I am not aware of any scheme that entitles the blind to relief of VRT on the purchase of a car. Schemes run by the Department of Health and Children, such as the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant may be of interest to the Deputy.</P>

     <QRef>[11177/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of the Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. The strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term having regard to the purpose of the fund, as set out in section <Col N="339"/>18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</P>
    <P>The features of the Act are similar to trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on draw-downs from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day-to-day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from 2025 until 2055, at least, is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that in investing fund moneys the commission will seek to optimise total financial return provided the level of risk is acceptable to the commission. Therefore, the commission is required to adopt a standard commercial investment policy and it does not have the discretion to choose not to invest in particular sectors or companies for anything other than commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>In determining the investment policy of the fund during the drafting of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, I considered whether the policy should be strictly commercial or whether it should be qualified by ethical, environment and other public policy criteria. A major difficulty in deciding on an ethical investment policy is where to draw the line, given that there will inevitably be different opinions and intense debate on what constitutes ethical and socially responsible investments. There is unlikely to be broad consensus on any ethical investment policy. I have no plans to revisit this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, the chairperson of the commission is required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts at that committee&rsquo;s request. Furthermore, the commission&rsquo;s annual report must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and is required to include a detailed list of the fund&rsquo;s assets at the end of the year. The commission&rsquo;s report for 2002 was published on 23 July 2003. The commission is specifically required to include in its report information on the investment strategy followed, a report on the investment return achieved by the fund and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at the end of the year. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the public at the appropriate time.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is long-standing practice in public service pension schemes for maximum benefits to be based on 40 years&rsquo; service, with service beyond 40 years conferring no additional benefits. Based on a standard accrual rate of one eightieth per year of service, this allows retiring public servants who have 40 years&rsquo; service to qualify for a lump sum of one and a half times their salary and a pension benefit equivalent to half salary. Most public service pension schemes, whether contributory or non-contributory, are financed by the Exchequer on a pay-as-you-go basis. In defined benefit contributory schemes, this means that members&rsquo; contributions do not determine the final salary benefits they can expect to receive on retirement. In such cases the employee contribution represents only a small part of the total cost to the employer of a public service defined benefit <Col N="341"/>occupational pension. These benefits compare favourably with provision in the private sector and international public service arrangements. I do not intend to improve them for persons whose service exceeds 40 years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question makes reference to the issue of persons remaining longer in the workforce. In this connection, I consider the recent enactment of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 to be an important measure, in that the requirement to retire on age grounds will not apply to most new entrants to the public service from 1 April 2004. There is no lack of coherence, therefore, between the policy for new entrants to the service contained in the Act and the maximum accrual of 40 years, in view of the excellent pension benefits available to public servants.</P>

	<P>Under section 13(1) of the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956, no person shall be appointed to an established position in the Civil Service unless the commissioners, after holding a competition under section 15 of the Act, have, under Section 17, selected him or her for appointment to that position. The Local Appointments Commissioners have no role in this regard. Section 13(1) of the Act does not apply to an appointment to an established position where the Minister, or the appropriate authority with the consent of the Minister, recommends an appointment to an established position and the Government, having considered such recommendation, decides that such an appointment would be in the public interest. This provision has not been used in the past 20 years. The Deputy might wish to note that political appointments such as special advisers and personal assistants are appointed to unestablished positions and are co-terminus with the Minister&rsquo;s term of office.</P>

	<P>The State rents some 200,000 sq. m. of office space in the Dublin area at a cost in the region of &euro;70 million per annum. In addition, the State uses some 230,000 sq. m. of State-owned office accommodation in Dublin. Under the decentralisation programme in excess of 200,000 sq. m. of office accommodation will be required in the regions for staff moving out of Dublin. A broadly equivalent amount of space will, as a consequence, be no longer required in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The issues surrounding the disposal of surplus Dublin space, both owned and leased, are being addressed. In this context, the specific circumstances associated with each building including location, quality and design, tenure, office area and whether its leasehold or freehold will be taken into account. The relocation of Departments and offices within the Dublin portfolio with a view to the optimum consolidation of Dublin office space will also be taken into account. The timing of property disposals and the market value of a building can be greatly affected by prevailing market conditions including a significant influx of properties to the market is another factor for consideration. The question of whether the new accommodation in the regions will be leased, newly built by the State or purchased, depends on the circumstances in each particular case. In general, rental levels in the regions tend to be lower than those applying in the Dublin area.</P>

    <P>On examination of the covering letter, dated 5 November 2003, submitted with the return, the taxpayer indicated that the delay in submitting the return was due to the fact that as her post was being redirected to her sisters she did not receive a letter from Scottish Provident advising her of her obligations until after the return filing date.</P><Col N="347"/>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a disposal of a yard which is attached to a commercial premises and where the premises is also a principal private residence, will give rise to a chargeable gain subject to capital gains tax.</P><Col N="348"/>
    <P>The sale of the yard will constitute a part-disposal of the entire property and a calculation of capital gain will be made. It will then be necessary to apportion the gain between commercial and private use. To the extent that the yard had a use as part of a principal private residence and the yard was not development land, the part of gain referable to that principal private residence use will be exempted. The part of the gain referable to commercial use will be charged to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>However, if the yard is development land where the proceeds represent more than current use value, then a calculation of overall gain will be made and capital gains tax will apply as follows. The increase in current use value will be chargeable and indexation relief will be available only in respect of years to 2002. The increase in development value will be chargeable and indexation relief will not be available. If the gain referable is to principal private residential use then the increase in current use value will be exempt. The increase in development value will be chargeable and indexation relief will not be available.</P>
    <P>Section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is the main governing provision but the calculation in the circumstances described are a little complex. It is, therefore, suggested that the individual in question should contact the relevant inspector of taxes in the Revenue Commissioners to discuss this particular case in detail.</P>

	<P>In the case of the investigation into bogus non-resident accounts, the Revenue Commissioners conducted on site DIRT look-back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000. The focus of these audits was the DIRT position of the financial institutions concerned. In the course of this audit programme, many bogus non-resident deposit accounts that belonged to taxpayers were identified.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners issued a statement of practice, SP-Gen 1/01, in May 2001, which set out a voluntary disclosure incentive scheme for taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts and who wished to disclose and pay all their outstanding tax liabilities by 15 November 2001. This approach to the bogus non-resident account problem was extensively publicised at the time. Many <Col N="349"/><?oasys_fc?>taxpayers took the opportunity that was offered and payments of &euro;227 million were made under the disclosure scheme.</P><?oasys _cl11.6-?>
    <P>Inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001 to identify taxpayers who chose not to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme. Eighteen applications for High Court orders under Section 908, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 were obtained. These High Court orders required the relevant financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning the identities of account holders who held non-resident deposit accounts. This information was the principal basis for identifying holders of bogus non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, inquiry letters were issued by the Revenue Commissioners to those taxpayers who were identified by this process. The inquiry letters sought disclosures and payment of outstanding liabilities within 60 days of the dates of issue. Some, of course, would have no liability. Since 15 November 2001, payments of &euro;285 million have been made to the Revenue Commissioners by taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts and who chose not to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of the investigation into holders of offshore accounts, the Revenue Commissioners advised the relevant financial institutions that an investigation would be initiated from a specified date and that the normal benefits of a qualifying disclosure, as outlined in the code of practice for Revenue auditors, would be available to those who chose to come forward before that date. After the specified date the holders of offshore accounts would no longer be able to make a qualifying disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, benefit from reduced penalties, non-publication and non-prosecution. The financial institutions wrote to the account holders in question advising them of the forthcoming investigation and of the benefits of making a qualifying disclosure. The Revenue Commissioners also publicly advertised the details of the voluntary disclosure scheme and produced a publication to assist people in understanding whether they might have a liability. The deadline to submit a notice of intention to make a qualifying disclosure was 29 March 2004. Some 15,000 individuals have indicated to the Revenue Commissioners that they will be making a disclosure. The people concerned have until 28 May 2004, to submit a statement of disclosure which should contain a tax computation, a payment and a declaration.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that where they discover a person to have held an offshore account and has a non-discharged tax liability but has failed to make a voluntary disclosure within the timeframe, that person will be vigorously pursued for unpaid <Col N="350"/>liabilities. Such an individual can expect to receive an inquiry letter from the Revenue Commissioners along the lines of those issued in connection with the investigation into bogus non-resident accounts.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners conducted on site DIRT look-back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000. The focus of these audits was the DIRT position of the financial institutions concerned. In the course of this audit programme, many bogus non-resident deposit accounts that belonged to taxpayers were identified. At its conclusion, financial institutions made payments totalling &euro;220 million to the Revenue Commissioners. These payments represented the DIRT, which should have been deducted together with the related interest and penalties. The Revenue Commissioners made a report on the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts which commented on the outcome of these audits in the final report on the DIRT inquiry, finalised on 3 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that no evidence was seen in the course of the DIRT look-back audit programme that would support an investigation of an official of a financial institution with a view to prosecution. The Revenue Commissioners also informed me that no deal was struck between them and the financial institutions to absolve or indemnify bank officials who may have acted improperly in setting up bogus non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prosecution of officials from financial institutions who may have assisted in placing funds in bogus non-resident accounts, the primary responsibility for ensuring that a tax return is correct rests with the individual making that return. There is a statutory offence in the tax code of knowingly aiding or abetting another person to make an incorrect tax return. However, generally in the case of third parties, it is difficult to meet the standard of evidence required to incriminate an alleged wrongdoing by a taxpayer who has failed to declare correct income or gains. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that while, in their experience, aiding and abetting offences are notoriously difficult to prosecute, it would be their general policy to pursue such cases if sufficient evidence becomes available.</P>

	<P>I am aware of views expressed by different commentators in this area but the evidence of well-supported demand and continued strong supply would seem to suggest the prospect of an orderly price evolution in the housing market. I <Col N="352"/>noted the April 2004 comprehensive analysis of the housing market by AIB, The Irish Housing Market, that concluded:</P>
    <P>Housing supply is at very high levels. However, the market is well underpinned on the demand side, not only by demographic factors but also by investor demand, the strength of demand for second homes and by the level of unsatisfied pent-up demand. Thus, prices are unlikely to crash and the risk of negative equity on any meaningful or material scale is small.</P>
    <P>I also noted that the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer is reported as having disputed various negative assessments of the UK housing market.</P>

    <P>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that, due to financial constraints and the heavy demands being placed on the Garda minor works programme, it was agreed with the Garda Authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform not to proceed with this project in 2003. It is, however, included in the agreed programme of works for 2004. The planning process for the refurbishment scheme is now complete and tender documents are being finalised for issue within the next two weeks. It is anticipated that a contract will be placed in mid-June 2004 and works should commence on site in early July 2004.</P>
    <P>With regards to Buncrana, to ensure that there remains operational cell accommodation on the Inishowen peninsula, it was agreed between the Garda authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to complete cell refurbishment to Burnfoot Garda station before the large scale works at Buncrana commence. In view of the later commencement date of the Burnfoot project, works to Buncrana Garda station will begin upon completion of the cell refurbishment at Burnfoot.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 to 295, inclusive, and 300 together.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council is discussing a cluster of development co-operation issues at today&rsquo;s meeting in Luxembourg. These issues include the follow up to the commitments given by the EU at the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development; the preparation of the EU&rsquo;s contribution for the United Nations high level event in 2005 to review progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals; and a debate on the reform of European Commission external assistance. Ireland, since assuming the European Union Presidency, has given priority to advancing EU action in all of these areas.</P>
    <P>The eighth millennium development goal provides for the development of a global partnership for development. While the other seven millennium development goals are primarily focused on developing countries, the eighth goal provides a role for donors in facilitating the achievement of the millennium development goals through a strengthened partnership with developing countries. The eighth goal has subsequently been elaborated by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme to embrace issues such as greater policy coherence, particularly in trade, debt relief and increased overseas development assistance.</P>
    <P>In January 2004, the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency agreed conclusions which said that <Col N="355"/>Ministers would consider, at the April General Affairs and External Relations Council, inviting the Commission to take on a role in monitoring the EU&rsquo;s contribution to the achievement of the millennium development goals. Ministers also stated that they believed that the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the achievement of the millennium development goals should be reflected across the range of the Union&rsquo;s policies and in its decisions on financial allocations.</P>
    <P>The Commission recently issued a paper outlining how a stocktaking of EU member states&rsquo; contributions to the achievement of the millennium development goals, including the eighth goal, could be undertaken. At today&rsquo;s General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting, the Presidency is pressing member states to give the Commission a formal mandate to embark on this work. The result of this stocktaking exercise, which will include an analysis of the extent to which member states have internalised the millennium development goals in their national development co-operation policies, will be an important element in the EU&rsquo;s contribution to the major UN review of progress towards the millennium development goals in 2005.</P>
    <P>The Presidency has proposed that the draft Council conclusions on this issue should highlight the importance of the seventh goal, which deals with the environment, and the eighth goal, as they are of most relevance to donors. The template for the national millennium development goal reports, proposed by the Commission, includes 15 indicators for monitoring the efforts of the member states on these two goals.</P>
    <P>A debate on the reform of EC external assistance, which is managed by the Commission, is also being held at today&rsquo;s meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Commissioner Nielson is to provide Ministers with an update on the reform process. The Presidency, with the support of member states, is anxious to ensure that the achievements registered so far in reforming the efficiency and effectiveness of EC aid are maintained and strengthened. It will be important that later this year the new Commission should have the necessary structures to achieve this. Ireland would like to see a dedicated portfolio responsibility for this critical area of policy in this Commission later this year.</P>
    <P>The question of reaching the UN goal of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development aid relates to the first of the eight commitments which the EU undertook at the Barcelona Council on 14 March 2002, as its contribution to the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development. At Barcelona, those EU member states that had not reached the UN 0.7% target committed themselves, as a first step, individually to increase their overseas development aid in 2003-2006 so <Col N="356"/>that collectively an EU average of 0.39% overseas development aid/gross national income is reached by 2006. All EU member states will also strive to reach, within their respective budget allocation processes, at least 0.33% overseas development aid/gross national income by 2006.</P>
    <P>At today&rsquo;s General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ministers are discussing the second annual monitoring exercise by the Commission on the progress achieved in meeting the Monterrey commitments, including that in relation to the volume of overseas development aid. The second Commission report indicates that this commitment is now well on track. In 2002, the EU member states collectively increased their overseas development aid by 2.8% and provided 0.34% of their gross national income to overseas development aid. The Commission estimates that if all current overseas development aid commitments are met, then the EU will exceed the Barcelona commitment to reach an average EU overseas development aid of 0.39% of gross national income by 2006 and will instead reach 0.43% of gross national income.</P>
    <P>All the EU member states are committed to reaching the UN target of 0.7%. Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden have already reached or exceeded the target. Belgium and Ireland have indicated timeframes by which they might reach the target. While decisions on establishing national timeframes for reaching the UN target are the responsibility of EU member states&rsquo; governments, the monitoring exercise undertaken by the Commission, on foot of the Barcelona commitments, is playing a key role in encouraging member states to increase their overseas development aid on the way to meeting the UN 0.7% target.</P>
    <P>Article 177 of the European Union Consolidated Treaties states, <i>inter alia</i>, that Community policy in the sphere of development co-operation, which shall be complementary to the policies pursued by member states, shall foster &ldquo;the campaign against poverty in the developing countries&rdquo;. Poverty reduction is, therefore, already anchored in the existing treaties. Last year, together with six of my EU ministerial colleagues, in a joint position paper to the Convention on the Future of Europe, I helped to have a reference to poverty reduction inserted as the objective of EU development co-operation in the text of the draft EU Constitutional Treaty.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the EU declaration on combating terrorism, adopted at the European Council on 25 March 2004, which states that receipt of EU development assistance will be directly linked to developing states&rsquo; efforts in containing terrorism. Section 12 of the declaration, which deals with international co-operation, commits the European Union to ensuring effective and practical co-operation with third countries through the &ldquo;development of technical assistance strategies, to facilitate <Col N="357"/>vulnerable third countries in enhancing their counter-terrorism capability, and by addressing counter-terrorism concerns into all relevant assistance programmes to promote good governance and the rule of law&rdquo;. There is no implication in this to suggest that receipt of EU development assistance would in any way be linked to states&rsquo; efforts to combat terrorism.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that Action From Ireland, Afri, launched a report, Death from a Distance: the Ongoing Militarisation of Ireland, on 2 April, a copy of which my Department has received. I understand, however, that the three universities referred to in the report in question have reportedly denied allegations that EU-funded research conducted by them has any links with the defence industry. I also understand that some of the technologies concerned, including those associated with the aerospace sectors, may have a dual use &mdash; that is, they can have a military as well as a civilian application. Indeed, the potential for dual use application is often a feature of these and some other high-technology sectors.</P>
    <P>More generally, I emphasise that all exports of military goods from Ireland must conform to the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control the export of military goods. Ireland was involved in the establishment of this code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow the exportation of military goods. These factors include respect for human rights and the internal situation in the country of final destination, as well as the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. Furthermore, any export of legally controlled dual use goods must only take place in conformity with Council Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 (as amended) of 22 June 2000. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to and participation in these systems underscores our position that any illegal movement and trade in armaments and military goods is totally unacceptable. I am satisfied that the manufacture of military goods and the development of technology in this country has no implications for our traditional policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>With regard to conflict prevention, the Deputy will be interested to know that from 31 March to 2 April, in the context of the EU Presidency, the Government hosted an international conference <Col N="358"/>in Dublin Castle on conflict prevention whose theme was the role of NGOs and civil society in the prevention of armed conflict. I draw the attention of the Deputy to my keynote address to this event, a copy of which is available on the Irish Presidency website.</P>

	<P>Ireland has always been committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and has played a distinctive role in the area of human rights, which has long been a central concern of our foreign policy. Accordingly, the Government attaches great importance to the role and work of the Commission on Human Rights, which has proved itself an essential forum for the promotion and protection of human rights around the world.</P>
    <P>The question of calling for the establishment of membership criteria for the Commission on Human Rights has been considered by Ireland, in conjunction with our EU partners and other like minded countries, in a variety of forums, including the Human Security Network. However, the Government concurs with the widely held view that the promotion and protection of human rights is best achieved via a broad consensus among a clear majority of states. The exclusion of parts of the international community from elaborating new standards and from addressing violations is not in the best interests of furthering human rights.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>The Government believes none the less that membership of the commission imposes special responsibilities. It offers states a unique opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to human rights instruments and to the discharge of human rights obligations. Members have the opportunity to play a leadership role in vindicating human rights worldwide. Furthermore, Ireland believes that the members of the commission have a responsibility themselves to uphold the standards of the UN human rights programme and to enhance the credibility and relevance of the commission.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>Ireland encourages all candidates to membership of the commission to demonstrate their commitment to the international human rights protection system, <i>inter alia</i> , by ratifying the core human rights treaties and by co-operating with the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights.

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The procedures for citizenship and passport applications for residents in South Africa are the same as for applicants elsewhere. Only Irish citizens may be issued with Irish passports. A person who was born abroad, one of whose parents was born in Ireland, is automatically an Irish citizen from birth. A person in South Africa who wishes to become an Irish citizen by descent from a parent who, although not born in Ireland, was an Irish citizen at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth, must first apply to the Irish embassy in Pretoria for Irish citizenship through entry in the foreign births register. Each applicant for foreign births registration is required to produce sufficient documentation including birth and marriage certificates and other relevant records for himself and his parent and grandparent, if relevant, through whom citizenship is claimed to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. When that entitlement is established, the details are entered in the foreign births entry book in the embassy and a certificate confirming the details of the entry is issued. This certificate must be produced with any subsequent passport application.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the volume of consular work handled by the embassy in South Africa, which is <Col N="360"/>also accredited to a number of other countries, including Zimbabwe, on a non-resident basis, has increased very considerably. As a result, there have been delays in the processing by the embassy of applications for foreign birth registration and consequent delays in issuing passports to those people. Last year, this backlog was reduced considerably. The embassy is currently taking about three months to process applications for foreign birth registration when full documentation is presented and is seeking to reduce this period further while facilitating urgent cases. If there are ongoing problems in particular cases concerning residents in South Africa, the ambassador and his staff are always available to assist applicants.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of reports from a number of sources, including Amnesty International, of crimes against women in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. The Amnesty International report, Intolerable Killings: Ten years of abductions and murders of women in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and Chihuahua, published on 11 August 2003, focuses on the horrific violence against women in Chihuahua state. According to the report, in the last ten years approximately 370 women have been murdered in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and Chihuahua, of which at least 137 were sexually assaulted prior to their death. Some NGOs believe the figures may even be higher. The report expresses concern about the Government&rsquo;s failure to address the murder of the young women, stating that &ldquo;the authorities, both within the state of Chihuahua and at the federal level, have been unwilling to recognise the extent of the pattern of violence against women and to implement effective policies for dealing with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A report of February 2003 by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, IACHR, also addressed the right of women in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez &ldquo;to be free from violence and discrimination.&rdquo; This followed a visit at the invitation of the Mexican Government by IACHR special rapporteur on the rights of women, Ms Marta Altolaguirre, to Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and Mexico city. A series of meetings have since been held between the IACHR and the Mexican Government to follow up on the report.</P><Col N="361"/>
    <P>Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez is a city which experiences serious violence and criminality. Its proximity to the border with the United States and the availability of work in its assembly plants attract a highly transient population, complicating the compilation of accurate data. It has become a major centre for drug trafficking and organised crime. Motives have not been established for many of the murders in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, although some share common characteristics. The Mexican authorities estimate that approximately one third of the victims were sexually assaulted prior to their deaths, with the remaining having been victims of intra-familial or other violence.</P>
    <P>Mexican and international NGOs have expressed concern about the necessity to protect the women of Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and to investigate the murders, stating that the authorities in Chihuahua and at a federal level have failed to recognise the extent of the pattern of violence against women and to implement effective policies for dealing with it. International observers such as representatives of the United Nations and of the IACHR have visited Chihuahua and expressed serious concerns about the investigations to date.</P>
    <P>The question of the respective competencies at federal and the local level has complicated matters. While steps aimed at improving efficiency had been taken by the local authorities, concerned observers had argued for some time that there was a need for the federal authorities to take a greater direct role in the matter. In the past year the federal authorities have become more engaged, having established grounds for federal intervention on the basis that some of the crimes may be federal offences. In June 2003, the interior ministry announced a 40-point plan to improve public security, criminal investigations, social advancement and women&rsquo;s rights in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez. This approach involves various Government agencies. On 11 August 2003 the Government announced the creation of a joint investigating and prosecuting agency, made up of the office of the attorney general and the Chihuahua state prosecutor&rsquo;s office.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of Amnesty International, Ms Irene Khan, visited Mexico in August 2003 to present the Amnesty report on the Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez killings, and met with the President, Mr. Fox, who made a commitment to ensuring that the federal Government played its full role in endeavouring to put a stop to the murders and abductions. On 17 October 2003, he announced the appointment of Ms Guadalupe Morfin Otero as federal commissioner for the cases in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez. Her role involves co-ordinating the activities of the inter-agency committee established to facilitate an integrated approach to the full range of the problems which impact negatively on women in the state of Chihuahua. Ms Morfin has a distinguished record as a defender and promoter of human rights.</P><Col N="362"/>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners hold regular dialogue with Mexico on matters of mutual interest, including human rights. In November 2003, the question of human rights and the specific situation of violence against women in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez was raised at a meeting in Brussels of the EU-Mexico joint committee. The Mexican representative acknowledged that the rule of law had malfunctioned over a period of time in that frontier area and outlined the measures being adopted by the Mexican federal and state authorities to strengthen the institutions of law and order with a view to putting an end to what he described as this &ldquo;cancerous phenomenon.&rdquo; In a move welcomed by the Mexican National Human Rights Commission, the federal attorney general decided in January 2004 to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with those Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez killing which have a federal dimension.</P>
    <P>When Ireland took over the EU Presidency in January, the Irish ambassador in Mexico City arranged for Ms Morfin Otero to meet with EU heads of mission in order to advance the EU&rsquo;s ongoing dialogue about the grave situation in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez. EU missions in Mexico city will continue to monitor the situation there and maintain contact with the Mexican authorities concerning the measures taken to address it.</P>

	<P>An application for a three-year passport for the child concerned was received in the passport office on 7 April 2004. Under the customer action plan of the passport office, this passport was due for issue on 21 April 2004. The normal procedure when issuing a passport to a minor is that the checking officer must contact the named witness on the parental consent form which accompanies the application in order to confirm that both parents have consented in writing to the issue of a passport to the child. This is an essential procedure to protect the safety and the travel rights of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>In this case no witness contact phone number was given. After searching for the school phone number, which was not entered on the application form, the checking officer was still unable to make contact with the witness due to the school mid-term break which covered the period from 8 April to 16 April inclusive. The checking officer realised that 19 April would be the next available date to contact the witness and that there was a danger that the passport express deadline for issue would be missed. For this reason, the application form was returned immediately to the applicant, requesting that a new parental consent form be completed in the presence of a witness who could be contacted by the passport office. Instead of meeting this <Col N="363"/>request, the parent of the child applicant sent back the original papers. On 19 April the passport office was able to make contact with the witness to confirm the parents&rsquo; signatures of permission to issue a passport and the passport was issued on 20 April.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of school principals or vice-principals on the list of acceptable witnesses to parental signatures on the parental consent form was decided following careful consideration. The passport office regards these people as particularly appropriate for this purpose as they would normally know the parents of the child and thereby help to ensure that only the legal parents or guardians complete the parental consent form. However, in cases where the issue of a passport is required as a matter of urgency, the responsibility lies with the applicant to ensure that the witnesses chosen can be contacted in sufficient time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the passport office provides a fine service and makes every effort to facilitate applicants provided, in the case of children, their rights are fully protected. In this case, I believe the passport office acted correctly in seeking confirmation of the witness&rsquo;s consent and I am pleased that, notwithstanding the additional work required as a result of this, the passport was issued within the ten-working-day period for processing Passport Express applications.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated previously, the Government takes seriously concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Dafa members. The issue of the treatment in China of followers of Falun Dafa has been raised both bilaterally and through the formal framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which was established in 1996. Through the dialogue, the EU shares with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion and urges China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally and, specifically, with respect to the freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on individual practitioners of Falun Dafa.</P>
    <P>The last session of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place in Dublin on 26-27 February 2004. Ireland, as holder of the Presidency of the EU, discussed with China a wide range of human rights issues of concern, including individual cases <Col N="364"/>of alleged human rights abuses. Among the cases raised were those of the individuals of concern to the Deputy. A response was subsequently received from the Chinese authorities. This stated that one of the individuals had been sentenced to re-education through labour for two years, but had been relatively quickly released on bail so he could seek medical attention. We understand that he is now in hospital receiving treatment. As regards the second individual, we were informed that the authorities had no record of the person being admitted to a labour institute.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the specific cases to which the Deputy refers involve Chinese citizens. They are subject to Chinese law while in their own country and as they are not Irish citizens, we have no consular function in this matter. However, because of our concerns about the human rights situation in China, we were prepared to raise the cases.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305, 306, 318, 319, 323 and 324 together.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of two full-time resource teachers, two full-time learning support teachers &mdash; one shared with another school &mdash; 16 full-time special needs assistants and four part-time special needs assistants, of which two full-time and two part-time special needs assistants are assigned to individual special needs pupils in mainstream classes. The remainder of the special needs assistants are deployed to cater for special needs pupils attached to special classes at the school.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department has received applications for additional special educational resources, SER, from the school on behalf of the pupils in question. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have been involved in on-going discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests. At this stage, it would be <Col N="366"/>premature to anticipate the outcome for the schools referred to by the Deputy. However, the basic purpose of the new system is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This process is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before he or she may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
    <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. Under the appeal process, a committee is established to hear the appeal. Oral hearings are conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for ensuring that a child progresses from primary to post-primary education rests in the main with the child&rsquo;s parents. Under section 17 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, parents are responsible for ensuring that their children attend a recognised school or otherwise receive an appropriate minimum education. The education welfare <Col N="368"/>board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act. Through its educational welfare officers the board provides a welfare-focused service that is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
    <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment of a student. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>

	<P>Children with serious disabilities that are of low incidence, for example, physical and sensory disabilities, moderate, severe or profound learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder and specific speech and language disability are normally assessed by the clinical services of the relevant health board before entering school. The issue of any backlog of assessments in that sector is a matter for the health boards. Where such serious disabilities are suspected in a schoolgoing child, the national educational psychological service prioritises these assessments to ensure that there is not a long waiting time. If the child attends a school that is not yet served by NEPS, an assessment may be arranged under the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Principals of schools that avail of the scheme prioritise the more serious cases for early assessment.</P>
    <P>It is the case that there has been a substantial number of children awaiting assessment where a less serious disability of high incidence is suspected, for example, mild general learning disability or specific learning disability. From September 2004, my Department is introducing a weighted system of resource allocation to schools. This will allow resources to be speedily allocated to children with disabilities on the basis of school-based assessment, pending full psychological or other professional assessment.</P>

However, it appears that the child concerned was not enrolled in the school.

    <P>My Department&rsquo;s main role in a school closure is to ensure that the best interests of pupils are looked after in the period up to the closure and that alternative provision is available to accommodate pupils who would otherwise have attended the school.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 321 together.</P>
    <P>The pupils referred to are enrolled in a special class for children with autism at the school in question. The staffing for special classes for children with autism, as outlined in the relevant Department circulars, is one teacher at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 together with two full-time special needs assistants. The school in question has four classes for children on the autistic spectrum with a total enrolment of 11 pupils in the four classes. These classes currently enjoy significant staffing resources. There are four teachers, 11 special needs assistants, nine full-time and two part-time deployed to cater for the pupils attached to these special classes.</P>
    <P>The pupils in question previously attended a mainstream school with a significantly greater pupil-teacher ratio, hence the need for a greater level of individual resource hours and special needs assistant support in that setting. The question of transferring resources arises only where it is considered that there are insufficient resources in the recipient school to cater for a pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>

	<P>My Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy. The school has the services of one full-time resource teacher, one part-time resource teacher and one full-time learning support teacher.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered. More than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority has been given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to before or soon after the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after the 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard. I have made arrangements for my officials to investigate the need for an additional special class at the school.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for the standardisation of breaks at Christmas and Easter and mid-terms were agreed at the Teachers Conciliation Council. The council comprises representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance. The issue of a derogation for certain schools, including boarding schools, was discussed at the council following representations from those schools. There was no agreement at the council to grant such a derogation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the discussions at the council was to implement a specific requirement in the national agreement Sustaining Progress. Sustaining Progress set the achievement of a standard school year as a requirement for all primary and post primary schools. In encompassing all schools in both sectors it was designed to bring certainty and clarity on a countrywide basis to the arrangements for the vacation periods covered by the agreement. The agreed arrangements achieve that purpose and will have general application. Schools continue to have discretion regarding the start and end of the school year which are not covered by the Sustaining Progress requirement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>If a teacher or parent has concerns about a child&rsquo;s learning and/or behavioural difficulties, the school can arrange an immediate educational assessment, administered by teaching staff. This will result in the drafting of a plan for extra help within the normal classroom setting in the relevant areas of learning and/or behavioural management. The success of the plan should be reviewed on a regular basis, with appropriate parental involvement. Teachers in schools that have access to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, may consult their area psychologist informally about their proposed learning or behavioural management plan. This consultation can usually be organised within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In the case of children with marked behavioural difficulties, where the class teacher&rsquo;s plan fails to achieve the desired outcome, then the child should, with parental permission, be referred to the clinical services of the Western Health Board. The length of waiting time for clinical assessment is a matter for the health board and voluntary bodies under its aegis.</P>
    <P>In the case of children with learning difficulties, where the class teacher&rsquo;s plan fails to achieve the desired outcome, then the child should be referred to the school&rsquo;s learning support teacher for further diagnostic testing. If this diagnostic assessment indicates that supplementary teaching would be beneficial, then this should be arranged by the school. Learning support teachers in schools that have access to NEPS may consult their area psychologist about diagnostic test results and about their proposed educational plans. This further in-school assessment can take place within a matter of a few weeks, if not days.</P>
    <P>School staff and parents should regularly review the progress of each child receiving supplementary teaching. If significant concerns remain after a reasonable period, then it may be necessary for the school to make a formal request for a consultation and assessment of need from a specialist from outside the school. Such specialist advice may be sought from psychologists, paediatricians, speech and language therapists, audiologists etc. With the exception of educational psychologists, these specialists are employed by the Western Health Board or by voluntary bodies under their aegis and, as stated earlier, the length of waiting times is a matter for the health board.</P>
    <P>Provision of individual educational psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS. Where the NEPS service is not yet available, the school may commission an assessment from a private practitioner under the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>NEPS psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological <Col N="384"/>order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools, and visits each on a regular basis. The school authorities provide names of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist&rsquo;s visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days. Where cases are less urgent, the psychologist will, as already described, act as a consultant to teachers and parents and offer advice about educational and behavioural plans. If the Deputy has particular cases in mind where waiting times for educational psychological assessment have seemed too long, then NEPS management will be glad to discuss these with the relevant schools and/or parents.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department has received an application for special educational resources SER for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September, and all these cases were <Col N="385"/>responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department is at present reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. My officials have been involved in on-going discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome for the school referred to by the Deputy. However, the basic purpose of the new system is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This process is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after the 31 August 2003, including the one for the pupil in question, will be also be considered in the context of the proposed new weighted system of allocation. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.</P>

	<P>I expect that any difficulties arising for children in accessing services such as those described by the Deputy would be brought to the attention of the relevant health board in the first instance. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on how those authorities manage their resources. I am fully committed to continuing the provision of teaching and special needs assistant <Col N="386"/>support for children who have been assessed as having special educational needs. In line with that commitment, part of the remit of the national educational psychological service is to work in close collaboration with the health boards and liaison mechanisms at national, regional and local level.</P>
    <P>A key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for children with special educational needs. To that end, a number of meetings have taken place between senior officials in my Department and their counterparts in the Department of Health and Children in relation to the drafting of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 and the establishment of the National Council for Special Education.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children from birth to 18 years who, because of disabilities, have special educational needs. Provision will be made in the Bill for a statutory structure which will guarantee the educational rights of these children, and also for a formal appeals mechanism. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Special Education is formally established and the recruitment process for the new grade of special education needs organisers, SENOs, is almost complete. Up to 80 SENOs will be engaged ultimately by the council. This will facilitate the provision of a range of services at local and national level in order that the educational needs of children with disabilities are identified and provided for. As part of its remit, the council will liaise with the health boards in relation to the co-ordination and consistency of their respective functions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 359 together.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department received an application for special educational needs &mdash; SEN &mdash; supports for the pupil referred to by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including the one made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department is at present reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have been involved in on-going discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome for the school referred to by the Deputies. However, the basic purpose of the new system is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This process is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued <Col N="389"/>in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the difficulties experienced by some families in Limerick city in securing second level places for their children. Responsibility for ensuring that a child progresses from primary to post-primary education rests in the main with the child&rsquo;s parents. Under section 17 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, parents are responsible for ensuring that their children attend a recognised school or otherwise receive an appropriate minimum education.</P>
    <P>The education welfare board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly, and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act. Through its educational welfare officers, the board provides a welfare-focused service that is accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
    <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.</P>
    <P>There are 15 post primary schools in the Limerick city area. I am satisfied that there is sufficient capacity overall in these schools to meet the demand arising from pupils leaving primary schools and requiring second level education.</P>
    <P>Officials from the regional office of my Department and the National Educational Welfare Board met with schools in the Limerick area concerning enrolment difficulties. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process to the Secretary General of my Department, where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment of a student. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General <Col N="390"/>of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 have been lodged with my Department in respect of refusal to enrol in post-primary schools in the Limerick area for the school year 2004-2005. Each appeal will be processed under the procedures for hearing and determining appeals, as published by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will understand that I have no role, as Minister, regarding the operation of the section 29 procedures. I cannot intervene in or exert any influence on an appeal which is in progress as this would be to act beyond my legal power and authority. Once these appeals have been completed, my Department will be working with the National Educational Welfare Board and the relevant school authorities to address the underlying enrolment difficulties in second level schools in Limerick.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the primary responsibility for service provision for pre-school age children rests with the appropriate health authority. However, my Department has established eight pre-school classes for children with autism, four in Dublin and four in Cork. In addition, my Department may sanction home tuition grants for children with autism who are of pre-school age and for whom a home educational <Col N="391"/><?oasys _fc?>programme is considered appropriate. Similar provision is made for children of school-going age who are awaiting an appropriate educational placement. My Department has also sanctioned a pre-school run by the model school for the deaf project on a pilot basis for five years to June 2007. This service caters for up to six pupils and is based in Cabra, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Last July, I published the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003. This Bill, when enacted, will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children from birth to 18 years who, because of disabilities, including autism, have special educational needs. Provision will be made in the Bill for a statutory structure which will guarantee the educational rights of these children, and also for a formal appeals mechanism. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Eligibility for additional resources is established by means of psychological, or other professional assessment. My Department&rsquo;s circular letters 7/02 and 8/02 define stringent criteria for identifying each category of disability and quantify the level of resources to be allocated in respect of each. A survey conducted by my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate in 2002 indicated a significant number of anomalies in the applications for extra resources. My Department has therefore decided to review new applications and to check the data in the supporting professional reports to see if they comply with the criteria in the circular letters.</P>
    <P>The assessment findings are not in dispute but it has been found in a significant number of cases that recommendations had been made for the allocation of extra resources, although the assessment data did not conform to the specific criteria outlined in circular letters 7/02 and 8/02. It is the responsibility of all professionals who conduct assessments to clarify in their reports to schools the eligibility for additional resources of the children assessed.</P>
    <P>From September 2004, my Department is introducing a weighted system of resource allocation to schools. This will allow resources to be speedily allocated to pupils with disabilities on <Col N="392"/>the basis of school based assessment, pending full psychological, or other professional assessment.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>if, in view of the recent ASTI survey which indicated difficulties with students under the influence of drink and drugs, he will consider introducing random drug testing in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[11509/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to introduce random drug testing in schools. My Department is aware of the many concerns which have been raised about young people&rsquo;s behaviour in relation to the misuse of substances. While education has a role in addressing the problem, effecting change in this area also depends on consistent support from the drinks industry, parents and society as a whole. A responsible attitude to the promotion of alcohol, especially in targeting young people, and ensuring rigorous implementation of the law on legal age limits regarding the sale of alcohol, are an essential part of this approach. Parents also have a responsibility in helping children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours.</P>
    <P>In general the community as a whole needs to reflect on the general attitude to the misuse of substances. Schools can play an active role in addressing the problems and consequences of the misuse of substances through the SPHE &mdash; social, personal and health education &mdash; curriculum which focuses on developing an informed and sensible attitude to substances. Through the SPHE curriculum, students are enabled to develop a framework for responsible and informed decision-making about their health, personal lives and social development. In particular, the substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in relation to their lives.</P>
    <P>All post-primary schools were required to implement the SPHE curriculum as part of the junior cycle core curriculum from September 2003. Ongoing support in the implementation of SPHE continues to be provided to schools through the post-primary SPHE support service, a partnership between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>Supports are also being provided through the SPHE support service to enable schools to develop their substance use policies. Guidelines for developing a school substance use policy were prepared by my Department together with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards and circulated to schools in 2002. <Col N="393"/>The central objective of a school substance use policy is the welfare, care, protection and education of every young person. The school policy can ensure schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and managing issues relating to substance misuse in a planned and considered way.</P>

	<P>Special needs assistants may be approved to assist a pupil who has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in circular 07/02. The circular may be accessed in my Department&rsquo;s website under &ldquo;Children with Special Needs&rdquo;. Any application received will be considered in the context of the criteria set out in the circular and the existing level of special needs assistant provision in the school.</P>
    <P>Since October 1998 the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to the current number of 4,319 full-time and 1,353 part-time posts at primary level. The budget for the provision of special needs assistants is allocated on a financial year basis. I can confirm the allocation for primary level for the financial years 2002, 2003 and 2004 as follows:</P>
    <P>2002: &euro;50.416 million</P>
    <P>2003: &euro;103.611 million</P>

	<P>My Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy, including an application for the pupil in question.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have been involved in ongoing discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome for the school referred to by the Deputy. However, the basic purpose of the new system is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This process is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after 31 August 2003, including those <Col N="397"/>made by this school, will also be considered in the context of the proposed new weighted system of allocation. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.</P>

	<P>The professional code of practice on evaluation and reporting for the inspectorate has been developed and published. This code sets out the general principles and guidelines under which members of the inspectorate engage in the process of evaluation and reporting.</P>
    <P>When inspectors are recruited, they complete an intensive induction and training programme which includes periods working with experienced inspectors in schools and centres for education. In addition, all inspectors participate in regular training programmes and seminars to ensure they are kept up-to-date with best modern practice in inspection work.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate also engages in ongoing development of the inspection tools it uses. The refinement of observation schedules and reporting templates ensures that inspection reflects changing curricula and methodologies in schools. These documents enable inspectors to evaluate the work of schools and teachers to the highest standards. For example, standard inspection frameworks, standard forms for collecting evidence and standardised reporting <Col N="398"/>templates are used during whole-school evaluation in primary and second level schools and in subject inspection in second level schools.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate publishes information on the evaluation criteria it uses. Most recently, the inspectorate has published Guide to Subject Inspection at Second Level, which describes the inspection of subject teaching at second level. The themes and frameworks for use in whole-school evaluation &mdash; by inspectors conducting external evaluations or school communities engaging in school self-review &mdash; have been published under the titles, Looking at Our School-Primary and Looking at Our Schools-Second Level.</P>
    <P>I should note that if a teacher or school affected by an inspection report believes the inspectorate has not conducted its work in accordance with its code of practice, the school or teacher may seek a review of the matter. The standardised procedure for such a review has been published as Procedure for Review of Inspections on Schools and Teachers under section 13(9) of the Education Act 1998.</P>

	<P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of <Col N="399"/>discipline and continuously disruptive pupils. Social attitudes and parental approaches to discipline vary from one school community to another, and it would be inappropriate for me as Minister to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools.</P>

	<P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the question of the minimum age at which pension should become payable to teachers. This issue, including the minimum age at which pension should become payable to public servants generally, has been the subject of a Government decision which was announced in the budget and has been explained to the public service unions. The decision reached, with which I am in full agreement, is that the minimum age at which pension should become payable to the generality of new entrants to the public service from 1 April 2004, including teachers, be set at 65. This decision, together with the decision that the upper age limit for retirement be abolished in the case of new entrants, has been included in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 which was enacted on 25 March last.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Act applies to new entrants and that teachers already in service on 31 March 2004 and whose service in public service employment from that date is uninterrupted, or is interrupted by a period not exceeding 26 weeks, may continue to avail of the provisions for retirement which were in place on 31 March 2004.</P>

	<P>My Department is not aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. However, on receipt of the name and address of the school concerned, the matter can then be investigated.</P>
    <P>The position generally is that concessionary fare-paying transport may be offered to children who are basically ineligible for transport, subject to there being room available on a service after all fully eligible children have been accommodated, and provided no additional cost is involved. Transport is offered on a first come first served basis.</P>

    <P>The standard maximum period of second level education is six years. Except in very exceptional circumstances, a pupil will not be permitted to repeat more than one year of the post-primary cycle prior to first sitting the leaving certificate examination.</P><Col N="405"/>
    <P>In certain instances, delegated authority within defined limits has been given to schools to permit students to repeat a year. An official from my Department has been in contact with the school authorities at Scoil Mhuire and has been informed that the person referred to by the Deputy successfully completed his junior certificate in 2003 and is no longer enrolled there. If he wishes to repeat a year he should first apply for enrolment in one of the schools referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Exceptional cases are examined on an individual basis, whereby, the school authorities submit a written request in relation to the particular pupil, together with supporting documentation. The case is then referred to my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate for their advice and recommendation. The school authority is informed of this decision.</P>

    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of one shared learning support post &mdash; based &mdash; and one shared resource teaching post &mdash; based.</P>
    <P>My Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy, including an application for the pupil in question.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have been involved in ongoing discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests. At this stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome for the school referred to by the Deputy. However, the basic purpose of the new system is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This process is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for processing applications received after the 31 August 2003 will also be considered in the context of the proposed new <Col N="407"/>weighted system of allocation. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.</P>

    <P>A modernisation agenda for the grade of special needs assistants was agreed earlier this year under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. An assessment of progress on the modernisation agenda is now being made by the Secretary General of my Department in consultation with the managerial authorities of first and second level schools and, subject to a favourable assessment, payment of the increases due with effect from 1 January 2004 will be executed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be advised of the payment date as soon as the arrangements are finalised. A further increase of 2% is due with effect from 1 July 2004.</P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. That may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment of a student. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
    <P>The education welfare board is required to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly and will also assist schools in fulfilling their role under the Act. Through its educational welfare officers, the board provides a welfare-focused service accessible to parents, school and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
    <P>I understand that an application to enrol the student referred to by the Deputy has been made to Scoil Aireagail, Ballyhale. However, no decision has been made on that application. I further understand that an educational welfare officer has met the child&rsquo;s family and will be maintaining contact with them.</P>
    <P>My Department allocates resource teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for students with special educational needs. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authority or VEC. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil or pupils involved, and the nature and level of the support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
    <P>To date, my Department has not received an application for additional resources from the school in respect of the student in question.</P>

	<P>Special needs assistants may be approved to assist a pupil who has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function, or where his or her behaviour is a danger to the pupil or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in circular 07/02.

    <P>From 1997 to 2004, there was an increase of almost &euro;300 million in the recurrent provision to the university sector. That represents an increase of approximately 90% over the period. Overall funding, capital and current, for the wider higher education sector will stand at &euro;1.48 billion in 2004. That is up &euro;631 million, or 74%, on 1997 levels.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the universities will be challenged in the short term by the constraints on recurrent Exchequer funding placed on them in 2004, having regard to overall cost pressures. I appreciate that individual institutions are required to find economies and to become more streamlined in some of their operations in order to reconcile available budgets with pre-existing demands and commitments. That must be viewed, however, in the context of overall increases in investment in higher education over recent years and the Government&rsquo;s longer-term strategic objective for excellence in the sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 410 together.</P>
    <P>The student charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services. Those costs continue to be incurred by the third level institutions. On 13 November 2003 I announced, as part of the 2004 Estimates for my Department, that the student charge would increase from &euro;670 to a proposed level of &euro;750. No decision has been made regarding the level of the charge for the 2005-06 academic year.</P>
    <P>Students eligible for means-tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the local authorities or the vocational education committees in addition to any grant to which they are entitled. No student whose family income is at or less than &euro;40,000 will pay this charge.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the higher education grant scheme, administered by the local authorities under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously. The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.</P>
    <P>However, clause 7.7 of the HEG scheme 2003 provides financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provision for progression at undergraduate and postgraduate level, the objective of the schemes of student support is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining at least one undergraduate and one postgraduate degree.</P>
    <P>Regarding students who hold a master&rsquo;s in law and are pursuing the professional practice course 1 and 2, considering that the master&rsquo;s held in such cases is in the discipline of law, and that the students concerned are continuing to study law full-time, and must complete the PPC 1 and 2 in order to practice as a solicitor, candidates may be considered under the HEG scheme subject to the usual terms and conditions of funding.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the state. That tax relief is applied at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions regarding that tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

	<P>The payment for supervision and substitution duties undertaken by substitute or part-time teachers in voluntary secondary schools and community and comprehensive schools is made by means of a grant payment to each school.</P>
    <P>This grant payment is the balance between the number of hours paid to teachers on the Department payroll and the total allocation due to the school as determined by reference to the number of whole-time equivalent teachers for each school.</P>
    <P>Teachers on the Department payroll who opted in 2001-02 school year to perform substitution or supervision under the terms of the scheme were paid in two instalments &mdash; in December and August. Where those teachers did not take up the total hours allocated to schools for supervision or substitution, the balance could be offered to substitute teachers who were subsequently paid by the school management from the grant referred to above.</P>
    <P>The grants for the 2001-02 school year have been paid to schools. Payments under the agreed scheme for substitution and supervision for the 2001-02 school year have been finalised.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is aware that I announced a pause in all capital developments in the third level sector, including capital projects under cycle 3 of the programme for research in third level institutions, or PRTLI, in November 2002. <Col N="417"/>Funding has been provided in the 2004 Estimates to commence cycle 3 of the PRTLI.</P>

    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received.

Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the nation-wide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department is at present reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have been involved in ongoing discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support with representative interests.

    <P>In the current academic year the enrolments on PLC courses in certain schools and colleges have exceeded the number of places approved. Teacher allocations for 2004-05 and capitation grants have been allocated on the basis of the approved number of places or the numbers enrolled.</P>
    <P>In the 2003-04 academic year nearly 28,700 places were approved. My Department is currently considering appeals from the VECs, schools and colleges for recognition of the excess numbers enrolled for the purposes of teacher allocations and grants and a decision in the matter will be taken shortly in the light of the totality of demands for teaching resources across the system.</P>
    <P>The post-leaving certificate review was commissioned to examine the sector and make recommendations as necessary regarding the organisational, support, development, technical and administrative structures and resources required in schools with largescale post-leaving certificate provision. The final report was completed in April, 2003.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision. The report poses considerable challenges in relation to the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future.</P>
    <P>The McIver report included a recommendation that organisations involved in the further <Col N="419"/>education sector should form a council of further education colleges with the specific composition of that body to be discussed further. As an initial step, the Minister of State, Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera will address a meeting of the stakeholders in the PLC sector, including a nominee of the TUI, on Tuesday 4 May with a view to having them agree proposals for submission to the Department about the composition and remit of the council.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, further consultations with all the relevant interests with regard to prioritisation of the recommendations will be necessary during 2004.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the importance of the NUIG engineering faculty for economic growth nationally but more particularly for the BMW region.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy is aware that I announced a pause with regard to all capital developments in the third level sector including capital projects under cycle 3 of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, in November 2002. Funding has been provided in the 2004 Estimates to commence cycle 3 of the PRTLI.</P>
    <P>At my request the Higher Education Authority is undertaking a review of the entire set of demands in the third level sector &mdash; excluding PRTLI &mdash; to establish prioritisation and agree re-phasing for future years.</P>
    <P>Each institution has met the review group and made a presentation of its institutional strategy and set the capital development proposals in a strategic context. Plans by NUI Galway for the proposed new engineering school formed part of its submission to the review group.</P>
    <P>The work of the group is at a very advanced stage and it is the intention to have a report submitted to the HEA shortly. The authority will then advise me of its views.</P>
    <P>Decisions as regards capital projects at third level institutions, including the proposed new engineering school at NUI Galway, will be taken in the context of the outcome of the review and within the parameters of the capital envelope of funds available to me.</P>

	<P>A staff survey on decentralisation was undertaken earlier this year and I will arrange to forward details to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is intended to put in place an integrated central applications facility to allow staff to apply for transfer to decentralised locations and to rank their preferences for different locations. This facility will be operated by the Civil Service Commission. Issues relating to accommodation will be dealt with centrally by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The report of the decentralisation implementation group, dated 31 March 2004, provides more detailed information on how the overall programme will proceed. This report is available on the Department of Finance website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for the standardisation of breaks at Christmas and Easter and mid-terms were agreed at the teachers&rsquo; conciliation council. The council comprises representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance. The issue of a derogation for boarding schools which operate a six day teaching week was discussed at the council following representations from those schools. There was no agreement at the council to grant such a derogation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the discussions at the council was to implement a specific requirement in the national agreement Sustaining Progress. Sustaining Progress set the achievement of a standard school year as a requirement for all <Col N="423"/>primary and post-primary schools. In encompassing all schools in both sectors it was designed to bring certainty and clarity on a country wide basis to the arrangements for the vacation periods covered by the agreement. The agreed arrangements achieve that purpose and will have general application. Schools continue to have discretion in relation to the start and end of the school year which are not covered by the Sustaining Progress requirement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, YPFSF, is, with the exception of one element, administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The only element of the YPFSF administered by my Department is that which relates to YPFSF projects which have already been mainstreamed, that is, are in receipt of regular funding having been assessed by the national assessment committee of the YPFSF. Information on all other elements of the YPFSF may be obtained by contacting the secretary of the YPFSF at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs directly at (01) 6473000.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task force scheme, LDTF, fund is managed by my Department. This provides grant-in-aid support for mainstreamed projects which have been assessed by a committee of the national drugs strategy team, NDST. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the lead Department in the NDST and therefore applications for support are made through that Department.</P>
    <P>The special projects for youth scheme is administered by the youth affairs section of my Department. Under this scheme, grants are allocated to organisations and groups for specific out-of-school projects that address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors, including social exclusion, substance abuse and inadequate take-up of ordinary educational opportunities. I will arrange to forward full details of the special projects for youth scheme to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin youth services board, CDYSB, operating under the City of Dublin VEC, is part funded by my Department. CDYSB may provide funding but, in the main, it is only for projects that have been approved under one of the schemes mentioned.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Ltd., ADM, also provides grants from the Dormant Accounts Subvention Fund. Further information may be <Col N="424"/>obtained by contacting the organisation directly by telephone at (01) 2400700 or at the following address: Area Development Management Ltd., Holbrook House, Holles Street, Dublin 2.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 431 together.</P>
    <P>My Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy including two applications for the pupils in question.</P>
    <P>SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, including those made by this school, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all of these cases were responded to before or soon after the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.</P>
    <P>The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. In that context, my officials have initiated discussions on the matter with representative interests. At this <Col N="425"/>stage, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome. However the basic purpose of that review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs. A further communication will be sent to schools shortly.</P>

Details of the numbers that have taken up teaching positions is also included.</P>
    <P>A detailed study of supply and demand issues in the second level sector, which has been carried out by the Higher Education Authority in conjunction with my Department, has identified a range of subject areas where supply and demand issues arise. The outcome of this study is currently being considered by my Department with a view to determining the measures which need to be put in place to address these issues.</P><Col N="425"/>

	<P>There are currently 3,292 recognised primary schools in the State. My Department does not have exact figures as to how many of these schools are wheelchair accessible since <Col N="426"/>many school authorities use their annual minor works grants to provide access for all to their schools.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide all new schools with access for all facilities and special toilets for disabled teachers and students. In addition, new schools with two or more storeys are provided with lifts. My Department advises school authorities and their design teams of accessibility requirements during the architectural planning process of projects.</P>
    <P>Concerning access for all to existing school buildings my Department will respond as promptly as possible to a request from a school authority for funding for adaptations necessary to allow any person with mobility problems access the building.</P>

	<P>The national educational psychological service, NEPS, assigns each psychologist to a number of schools, taking into account the time available for the psychologist to visit schools. In the case of the school mentioned by the Deputy, the assigned NEPS psychologist was promoted some time ago. It was therefore necessary to withdraw his services from a number of schools, <Col N="431"/>including this particular school, in order to allow time for him to fulfil his managerial responsibilities. Unfortunately, no additional psychologists have been recruited to County Wexford since this withdrawal of service, so it has not yet been possible for NEPS to arrange for a replacement.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>NEPS regrets this situation, and will resume a full psychological service to the school as soon as additional personnel are available. During the interim period, the school may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments.</P>

	<P>My Department has issued guidelines to schools on exemption from the study of Irish at post-primary level. These are outlined in circular M10/94 published by my Department.</P>
    <P>Provision exists in this circular for pupils who have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the <Col N="435"/>mother tongue. The evidence of such a disability should be furnished by a qualified psychologist to enable the evaluation on the necessity to exempt the particular pupil from the study of Irish. Delegated authority within the defined limits of the circular has been given to schools to permit a pupil to be granted an exemption from Irish.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department allocates resources to second level schools and vocational educational committees to cater for students with special educational needs. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authority or VEC. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil(s) involved and the nature and level of support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.</P>
    <P>No containers were reported lost at sea off the Irish coast since 2000 as a result of rough weather. Problems regarding containers falling overboard relate mainly to large container ships. While some of these pass the Irish coast, Ireland does not have deep sea container berths. It is usually smaller feeder ships that call to Irish ports.</P>
    <P>The SOLAS convention of the International Maritime Organisation deals with cargo securing on vessels and this requires ships to carry an approved cargo securing manual. My Department&rsquo;s port state control inspectors carry out inspections and regularly review the cargo securing manual of cargo ships visiting our ports. Containers aboard sea going vessels can be lost overboard for various reasons, such as difficult weather conditions, collision or sinking of vessels. Containers, once lost and adrift at sea, represent a danger to commercial and leisure vessels, and <Col N="438"/>their contents might also be harmful to the environment.</P>
    <P>Shipmasters are obliged under the SOLAS convention to report any direct danger to navigation in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue zone of responsibility to the Irish Coast Guard. This would include details of any container lost from their ships. On receipt of such a report the Coast Guard initiates the procedures of warning other ships in the vicinity, notifying relevant interested parties and taking any safety and environmental protection measures that are required. Decisions made about intervention to remove the danger posed by a container adrift, including searching, marking, recovery and destruction, would be agreed, where possible, with the ship owner.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the existing legislative arrangements governing the carriage of containers on cargo ships and I do not intend to bring forward a proposal on this issue during the Irish Presidency.</P>

	<P>Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, the project in question was allocated a grant of &euro;45,711 in 2000. As I outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 101 in March of this year on the same issue, 95% of the 2000 grant has been paid and the remaining 5% <Col N="443"/>is retained in accordance with standard practice, pending the receipt of certification of completion of the defects liability period of the project. On receipt of the certification in question, the balance of the grant will be paid.</P>

     <Quest>if, further to his reply of 13 January 2004, funding has been put in place to commence the NDP sport and recreational facilities sub-measure under the BMW operational programme.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, there has been no expenditure under the sports and recreational facilities sub-measure of the NDP&rsquo;s regional operational programme. The Deputy will be aware that the sub-measure was to be based on the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s national spatial strategy, which was approved in November 2002. No provision for expenditure on the sports and recreational facilities sub-measure was included in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism budget for 2003 or 2004 which would have enabled the introduction of a new programme.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of any such new programme, there are a number of other factors to be considered. Since 1998, grants to the value of &euro;270 million have been allocated to 3,500 projects under the Department&rsquo;s sports capital programme, many of which are of the nature envisaged in the sub-measure. In addition, under the Department&rsquo;s local authority swimming pool programme, there is an ambitious programme which provides funding for local authorities towards pool provision.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, the development of a national sports facilities strategy will commence shortly and will be prepared in tandem with the national audit of sports facilities. The audit, which will provide the Department with a database of existing facilities, is viewed as critical to the effective delivery of a future sports facilities programme. A further factor to be considered is the capacity of local authorities to undertake additional borrowings within the context of the general Government balance.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 2005 Estimates, the Department proposes to revisit this measure, taking into account the outcome of the strategy process, the national audit, the budgetary situation and the recommendations from a recently completed, but not yet publicly available, expenditure review on the sports capital programme.</P>

	<P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs. The FSAI carries out checks on the marketplace for compliance with the GM legislation. I am advised that the FSAI is satisfied that, based on current scientific opinion, GM products authorised within the EU are safe for human consumption. The FSAI undertakes surveys to check for compliance with regulations on the labelling of genetically modified food. The surveys, which form part of the EU co-ordinated programme for the official control of foodstuffs, examine a wide range of both soya and maize containing foods.</P>
    <P>The results show that some of the samples tested contained GM ingredients authorised for food use within the EU, although none of the samples which were found by the FSAI to contain GM material contained greater than the 1% threshold allowed under EU legislation. This threshold is further reduced to 0.9% in the most recent regulations. Under EU Regulations, food or ingredients that meet the threshold for GM content do not require GM-specific labelling if the operator can show that the food or ingredients were from a non-GM source, which would indicate that the GM content was due to technically unavoidable contamination. None of the samples found by the FSAI to contain GM material contained greater than the threshold.</P><Col N="445"/>
    <P>I have been informed that sweetcorn tested as part of these surveys has been GM free. The FSAI has indicated that it is planned to include sweetcorn as part of its 2004 survey.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>

	<P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs. The FSAI carries out checks on the marketplace for compliance with the GM legislation.</P>
    <P>The FSAI has carried out a number of surveys of the food supply chain in recent years and has employed both state laboratories as well as private laboratories to carry out testing of the genetic material, DNA, in a range of foods using a technique called polymerase chain reaction or PCR. This is a rapidly expanding and highly sensitive technique employed for a range of other uses, including academic research and forensic science. This technology can be used to test for the presence, and sometimes the amount, of a GMO present in a food relative to its non-GMO counterpart.</P>
    <P>The EU, under the auspices of the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, has undertaken to standardise how GMOs and derived food and feed are tested using PCR and validation of a number of tests is already well advanced. New legislation has just come into force that also stipulates what applicants must provide by way of material and information to enable testing for specific GMOs before they will be authorised for marketing.</P>

    <P>A formal announcement of the terms of reference will be made shortly. In broad terms, it is intended that the inquiry will examine the hysterectomy rate at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and determine how the rate compared with rates in similar hospitals. It will inquire into whether Dr. Neary&rsquo;s practice was commented or acted upon by others at the hospital. It will examine whether internal or external reviews were conducted. It will also inquire into the measures put in place to prevent a repeat of those events at the hospital and offer advice on any additional systems that should be put in place.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of meetings with Patient Focus, the patient support group, to discuss the proposed terms of reference and format of the inquiry.

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of my Department on the care of older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence in their own home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. This policy was first enunciated in the &ldquo;Care of the Aged Report&rdquo; which was published in 1968 and confirmed in the report, &ldquo;The Years Ahead: A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo;, published in 1988. Numerous research studies have shown that the vast majority of older people have a preference to remain living in their own home for as long as possible rather than moving into long stay residential care.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State I have encouraged the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangement for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long stay residential care.</P>
    <P>Standards of care in private nursing homes are governed by the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993. My Department is currently reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the nursing home subvention regulations to determine their relevancy and efficacy in providing long-term care to the elderly. The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients, provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means testing, be less discretionary, be consistent in implementation throughout the country and be financially sustainable.</P>
    <P>The position regarding measuring nurse staffing levels is that, on foot of recommendations made by the Commission on Nursing, a working group was recently established with the following terms of reference: to agree a common understanding of the term &ldquo;skill-mix&rdquo; in the health care environment and its application in determining nurse staffing levels; to identify and evaluate the current systems being utilised in the Irish health care setting and to identify areas of best practice; to review literature on current systems of determining nurse staffing levels in a national and international context and to determine whether these systems have the potential to be adopted or modified to suit the Irish health care system; to recommend principles underpinning systems of determining nurse staffing levels within the Irish health care system. The working group is chaired by the chief nursing officer of my Department and includes <Col N="448"/>representatives of the Health Service Employers Agency, the Psychiatric Nurses&rsquo; Association of Ireland, the Irish Nurses Organisation, SIPTU nursing, IMPACT, employing agencies and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <?oasys _ah?><P>Standards for the management of nursing homes in the private sector are provided for under the various legislative instruments mentioned above. Furthermore, the implementation of the provision whereby incontinence wear is supplied to older people in private nursing homes is a matter for each health board in the context of it&rsquo;s overall revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. The request to health boards to implement a provision whereby incontinence wear is supplied to medical card holders in private nursing homes issued from my Department in February 2001.</P><?oasys _xh?>

	<P>The parents have primary responsibility for the registration of the birth of their child. The particulars required to be entered in the register of births include the forenames and surnames of the parents and the forename(s) and surname assigned to the child. The Registration of Births Act 1996 provided for a surname to be assigned to the child at the time of registration.</P>
    <P>I am informed by An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General of births, stillbirths, deaths and marriages, that the birth of the child referred to by the Deputy was registered at the joint request and under the joint signatures of both parents. The surname, assigned to the child, which was a combination of the surnames of both parents, was entered in the register. In these circumstances there is no provision to change the surname of the child entered in the register. This has been explained to the mother of the child in question.</P>
    <P>However the parents were afforded an opportunity to standardise the format of the surname, without any substantive change, by the deletion of a comma between the two elements of the surname, with an option to substitute a hyphen, by way of an amendment under the provisions of section 27 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880. This facility has not been availed of to date.</P>

These reviews are necessary to ensure that the patients continue to be eligible for GMS services and to satisfy public accountability obligations on the management of health board medical card databases. The withdrawal of medical cards can be attributed in some measure to the rise in the number of persons in employment and also to the data cleansing exercise which was carried out on medical card databases in 2003. It should be noted that most of these deletions arose from normal medical card review activity.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to psychiatric nursing students on the undergraduate nursing degree programme who undertake a number of clinical placements throughout the academic year as part of their nursing studies. Nursing students do not get paid a salary while on clinical placements.</P>
    <P>While on clinical placement, undergraduate nursing degree students are entitled to an accommodation allowance up to, but not exceeding, &euro;50.79 per week where it is necessary for the student to obtain accommodation away from her/ his normal place of residence. It must be stressed that this allowance is payable only where it is necessary for a student to obtain a second accommodation for the duration of the placement. Students are also entitled to a weekly travel pass while on external clinical placement. <Col N="459"/>These allowances are outlined in circular 9/2004 which recently issued from my Department.</P>
    <P>Funding in respect of the costs associated with the clinical placement allowances was provided historically and on an ongoing basis to the relevant health agencies, including St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Fairview, for the pre-registration nursing diploma programme. While the pre-registration diploma programme will conclude this year, the funding will remain in the base determinations of the health agencies to which it was provided and will be used to fund the payment of clinical placement allowances to degree students. I have contacted St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Fairview, regarding this issue. St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital has confirmed no student needed to obtain a second accommodation for the duration of her/his placement and, therefore, no student was entitled to receive an accommodation allowance.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of circular 43/2001, which governed the payment of external clinical placement allowances to students on the pre-registration nursing diploma programme, students are entitled to avail of allowances only when undertaking placements external to their normal hospital base. St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital has confirmed that degree students have not received travel passes to date, as hospital officials were unclear as to whether the students&rsquo; affiliated hospital was still deemed to be the students&rsquo; base. However, following clarification from my Department that the higher education institute is to be regarded as the students&rsquo; base, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview, is arranging to reimburse degree students in respect of their travel costs.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>While medical practice in the area of assisted human reproduction is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council, services such as IVF are not subject to a statutory framework of control. As a consequence, the provision of IVF treatment is not publicly funded and, as such, is not available in the public health services. Persons wishing to avail of this treatment must do so in a private capacity and are obliged to meet the costs themselves.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in certain instances, there is some cross subsidisation which allows for the treatment to be provided free to medical card holders. It should also be noted that persons undergoing IVF are eligible for tax relief on medical expenses and that the drugs used as part of fertility treatment are covered by the drugs payment scheme.</P>
    <P>I should add that, with a view to addressing concerns about the absence of statutory control in this area, the commission on assisted human reproduction is currently examining the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in the area. The issues involved are complex and, while the commission is nearing completion of its work, it is not possible to be definitive on when exactly it will finalise the report.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of educational services, including school placement, transport and the provision of special needs assistants, resource teachers and so forth, for children with special needs is a matter for the Department of Education and Science. The health services provide a range of health related support services for children with special needs, including speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to children and adults with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals, such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of training places. Last year, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increase in the number of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the <Col N="462"/>public health service over the three year period to end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>While there has been significant progress in enhancing the health related support services available to children with special needs, there is need for a continued programme of investment in this area. In the meantime, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards have been asked to explore other possibilities such as the purchase of additional therapy services.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced in 1973 by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act 1970.</P>
    <P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children, from birth to the age of 16 years, who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year. Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to the means test. While no condition is debarred, conditions such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy are not normally considered unless there is a high degree of additional care and attention required.</P>
    <P>Since the allowance is intended as a recognition of the additional burden involved in caring for children with a severe disability in the child&rsquo;s home, it does not apply to children who are maintained full time in residential homes, schools or other institutions. Eligible children in part-time residential care who go home at weekends or holidays may receive a <i>pro rata</i> payment, that is, a nightly rate based on the number of nights spent at home. The nightly rate is equal to the monthly rate multiplied by 12 and divided by 365. However, the allowance is paid in full in cases where eligible children who live full time at home are absent for a period/s of not more than eight weeks in any 12 month period, that is, hospital admissions or respite.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer or other designated medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether a child qualifies for domiciliary care allowance on medical grounds. The application form for domiciliary care allowance should be obtained by the client or their parent/guardian at local health <Col N="463"/>board offices, completed and submitted to the appropriate community services office.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of <Col N="464"/>orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards/authority in the first instance. The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines.</P>
    <P>The guidelines were issued in 1985. They are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws, such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than in category B. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted in some health boards due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients; consequently, a category C waiting list may not be maintained in some health boards.</P>
    <P>However, I have taken a number of measures to address the shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003.</P><Col N="465"/>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards/authority have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, there were 21,033 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and almost 4,000 extra children are getting treatment from health boards/authority since the end of 2001.</P>

	<P>The expansion of existing rheumatology services is initially a matter for the Western Health Board based on relative priority accorded to the service by the board. The board has prepared a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services in the region which proposes the appointment of additional rheumatologists. I agree that there is a need for additional investment in rheumatology services both in the west and in other regions. However, the question of funding for additional posts in the west can only be considered in the context of available resources and the Western Health Board&rsquo;s overall priorities for services in 2004 in the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, which is the statutory body with responsibility for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, carried out a review of <Col N="466"/>rheumatology and rehabilitation services in 1995 and, in the context of this, is currently examining the Irish Society of Rheumatology, ISR, report, &ldquo;Rheumatology Manpower Report 2002&rdquo;, which examines the current state of rheumatology services and identifies the resources needed to develop this service. Future planning requirements will be considered by myself and my Department in the context of the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al examination.</P>

	<P>Smoking is prohibited on all public service vehicles owned or operated by Dublin Bus. Under Dublin Bus by-laws, authorised persons, including inspectors, drivers and conductors, have powers to enforce regulations in this area. I am advised that Dublin Bus currently operates plain clothes monitoring to detect breaches of smoking by-laws on its services. Dublin Bus has also advised that 350 prosecutions were processed in 2003 with fines ranging up to &euro;300. To date this year, 80 prosecutions have been brought or are being processed.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus has reported that complaints about breaches of smoking by-laws on its services have decreased since the introduction of the smoke free workplaces measures last month. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that the prohibition on smoking on bus services is observed and enforced to ensure protection of passengers and Dublin Bus personnel from the harmful effects of toxic environmental tobacco smoke.</P>

	<P>Additional funding amounting to approximately &euro;16 million has been provided since 1998 for services to children with intellectual disability and those with autism. Children with physical or sensory disabilities would also have benefited from the additional funding provided for those services in recent years.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to children and adults with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals, such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places. Last year, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increases in the numbers of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the three year period to end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increase in speech and language therapists. While there has been significant progress in enhancing the health related support services available to children with special needs, there is a need for a continued programme of investment in this area.</P>

    <P>Following consultations which I had with the chairman in late 2002, it was agreed that the inquiry would give priority to the completion of its work in respect of post-mortem issues in paediatric hospitals with a view to furnishing a report by the end of 2003. This was to be followed by a second report on post-mortem issues in maternity hospitals and a third report relating to other hospitals. In recent correspondence, the inquiry has informed me that it has not proved possible to complete the report on paediatric hospitals within that timeframe as matters have <Col N="472"/>taken longer to conclude than previously anticipated.</P>
    <P>The inquiry advises that, with some exceptions, the information gathering in paediatric hospitals is complete and the issue of analysing the information and establishing which matters remain in dispute has been concluded. The inquiry must now deal with the resolution of matters in dispute and the conclusion of the report. This involves: communication to participants of matters in dispute; written evidence on matters in dispute; such oral hearings as are necessary about matters in dispute; resolution of such matters; opportunity for participants to make submissions where the report proposes to make criticisms.</P>
    <P>The inquiry further advises that it has at all times kept in mind the need to be in a position to proceed with its work regarding the maternity hospitals as soon as the paediatric hospitals report has been completed. The inquiry has, therefore, continued to work in this regard to ensure that all documentation will be available to the inquiry when required.

	<P>Policy on the development of services for older people is as set out in the report, The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly, which was published in 1988. The recommendations contained in the national council on ageing and older people&rsquo;s review of the years ahead report, together with priority <Col N="473"/>areas highlighted by health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, were taken into account when the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, which was published in 2001, was being prepared. Norms for service provision as set out in the health strategy bear reasonable comparison to those used by other EU and developed countries and are widely accepted as appropriate to meet the needs of older people.</P>
    <P>Figures from the 2002 census compiled by the Central Statistics Office suggest that the average age of the population is increasing. The 2002 census indicates that in 2002, 11.13% of the Irish population was aged over 65 years, which represents an increase of 5.4% on the 1996 figure. Forecasts suggest that by 2031 this figure will have more than doubled and that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years will be between 18% and 21% at that stage. The Government is aware of this trend and, in fact, addressed some of the issues arising from it in its health strategy.</P>
    <P>In so far as the development of services to meet an increasing population of older people is concerned the health strategy outlined the need for the following developments: in community services &mdash; recruitment of a multi-disciplinary range of staff to support the development of primary care services such as domiciliary care and day and respite services and the provision of 7,000 day centre places; in hospital services &mdash; 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds; associated development of acute geriatric medical services and appointment of additional geriatricians; 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics; in residential care &mdash; 5,600 additional extended care/community nursing unit places over a seven to ten year period, including provision for people with dementia; improved staffing levels in extended care units.</P>
    <P>The provision of the above services is contingent on the necessary resources being made available. With regard to performance, national standards for community and long-term residential care of older people will be prepared.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, over &euro;280 million in additional revenue funding has been provided for the development of services for older people. In addition, significant capital funding has been made available through the national development plan for the provision of additional extended care beds and associated facilities around the country. Proposals are also being developed for the provision of an extra 850 long-stay beds in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health Board areas under a public private partnership pilot scheme.</P>

	<P>The policy of my Department regarding the care of older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence in their own home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. This policy was first enunciated in the Care of the Aged Report which was published in 1968 and confirmed in the report, The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly, published in 1988. Numerous research studies have shown that the vast majority of older people have a preference to remain living in their own home for as long as possible rather than moving into long-stay residential care.</P>
    <P>Older people who suffer strokes are treated in acute hospitals where appropriate and are discharged subject to the necessary after care package being put in place. Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have been encouraging the authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services, such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long-stay residential care.</P>
    <P>There is commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. These additional services are, of course, dependent on overall funding resources available.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547 to 549, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the number of management and administrative staff employed in the health service generally and in the acute hospital sector in particular. The information requested by the Deputy on employment levels for particular categories of health service staff is set out in the following table. It is important to note that caution should be exercised in comparing growth in numbers employed over the period among the different grade categories, as changes in grade classifications have given rise to a lack of continuity in the data series.</P><Col N="476"/>
    <P>As far as the question of administrative economy is concerned, the Deputy may wish to note that almost two-thirds, 64%, of health services personnel formally classified as &ldquo;management/administrative&rdquo; are involved in direct service provision to the public. In fact, it is estimated that only 6% of health services personnel are employed in a purely administrative capacity. It is important to emphasise that these administrative staff work in areas that are critical to the effective running of the health services such as payroll, accounts, financial and human resource management, including training, freedom of information and general management. In this regard the report of the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service, chaired by Professor Niamh Brennan, concluded that there was no evidence to support the perception that administrative staff, rather than those providing a direct patient service, have disproportionately absorbed additional resources allocated to the health service over recent years.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not hold comparable employment information for other EU countries, recently published UK National Health Service data indicate that the number of staff employed in administrative grades is broadly in line with the Irish figures on a proportionate basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to reductions in health service staffing, the Government decided in December 2002 that the contribution of the health service to the overall reduction in public sector employment should be limited to a total of 600 personnel in WTE terms in the period to end-2005 or 200 staff per annum, in view of the high proportion of health service personnel engaged in front line service delivery posts. Given that the health service accounts for in excess of 30% of overall public service employment, a <i>pro rata</i> application of the Government&rsquo;s targeted reduction in public service employment of 5,000 would have required an aggregate reduction in health service employment of 1,728 staff in wholetime equivalent, WTE, terms.</P></Speaker><Col N="475"/><Miles com="level"/><Col N="475"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 550 and 551 together. I understand that informal exploratory discussions have been taking place between St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght, and the Medical Faculty of Trinity College Dublin regarding the scope for the integration of their governance structures.</P>
    <P>It will be for the three institutions, in the first instance, to come to a view as to whether such integration would be in their best interests. As far as I am aware, there is no question of any change in governance arrangements without the agreement of all the parties involved nor is there any question of a diminution of services.</P>

	<P>The health service reform programme provides for the modernisation of the health service and the achievement of the goals and objectives of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You. The Health (Amendment) Bill 2004, which was published on 16 April 2004, represents a further phase in the implementation of the reform programme. It provides for the termination of office of the members of the seven health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and its three area health boards. The Bill also assigns the functions, which are currently carried out by the members of the boards or authority to the chief executive officers of the boards or authority or the Minister, as appropriate. The Bill is an interim measure and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is my intention to publish a second Bill later in the year to provide for the establishment of the health service executive, <Col N="482"/>HSE, and the health information and quality authority, HIQA, on a statutory basis. This further legislation will also provide the legislative basis for other aspects of the reform programme such as improved governance and accountability, planning and monitoring and evaluation. My intention is to have this legislation introduced by December 2004 so as to have the HSE in place in January 2005.</P>
    <P>Both the Brennan and Prospectus reports which are central to the reform programme speak of the likelihood of savings in the implementation of their respective recommendations. However, the Prospectus report also states that it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the true financial impact of programmes of this scale. The re-alignment and streamlining of functions and structures in the health system are expected to generate efficiency gains over time and any resources freed up will be re-invested in strengthening front line services. I am satisfied that the new arrangements, combined with the introduction of system-wide best practice governance and accountability systems, will ensure a stronger, more effective health system and an improved health service for patients and clients.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On 29 March last, most enclosed places of work became smoke free. The primary purpose of this measure is to protect the health of workers and the public from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. The response to date across all sectors is very positive with compliance at a very high level. The successful introduction of the new measure reflects the widespread public support and goodwill that exists for a clean smoke-free environment in the workplace. As herbal cigarettes are not classified as tobacco products, their smoking is not prohibited under the smoke-free workplaces measures. A decision to allow the consumption of these products in premises where the smoking of tobacco products is prohibited is a matter for the management of the premises concerned.</P>

	<P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. The most recent information available indicates that approximately 400 homes had been registered, with 8,300 people in receipt of subvention. The subvention scheme was never intended to pay the full costs of private nursing home care but to give some financial assistance to those people most in need.</P>
    <P>The rates of subvention are &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 per week depending on whether the assessed level of dependency is medium, high or maximum. A sum of &euro;5 million was allocated for the scheme when it was introduced in 1993. However, due to a range of factors, including demographics, increasing levels of dependency and economic circumstances, the costs of the scheme have risen as follows: 1993, &euro;5 million; 1994, &euro;15.192 million; 1995, &euro;19.345 million; 1996, &euro;21.438 million; 1997, &euro;35.361 million, including &euro;5 million once-off; 1998, &euro;30.282 million; 1999, &euro;42.129 million; 2000, &euro;48.439 million; 2001, &euro;66.973 million; 2002, &euro;102.94 million; and 2003, &euro;110 million. An additional sum of &euro;3.749 million was made available in 2004 bringing total expenditure on the scheme to &euro;113.749 million.</P>
    <P>A review of the nursing home regulations is also underway. This review will look at all aspects of the scheme including the allowances given for assets, assessment procedures for means and dependency. The Department is also in the process of consulting all stakeholders with an interest in the scheme to hear their views on how it might be improved to benefit the most important people involved, that is the patients. As mentioned earlier, if a person opts for private nursing home care and seeks a subvention from the State, a means test is employed to take into account the value of that person&rsquo;s property. This is only done if that person does not have a dependent relative or a relative in receipt of certain social welfare payments in residence in the house. One of the terms of reference of the review group on the nursing home subvention scheme is to make recommendations on an equitable means assessment test for subvention.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy to note that my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, recently launched a publication, Study to Examine the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, prepared by Mercer Limited. The objective of this study was, <i>inter alia</i>, to look at the best ways to structure support for long-term care and to look at the most effective and equitable methods of funding.</P>

	<P>The smoke-free workplaces measures apply, with limited exceptions, to all enclosed places of work. The exemptions are specified in the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Act 2004. Where a community hospital meets the requirements so specified an exemption will apply. A decision to allow the smoking of tobacco products in exempted premises is a matter for the management of the premises concerned. However, the fact that a premises is exempted does not confer a right to smoke in that location and neither does it affect the duty of care an employer has in respect of his or her employees.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been examined within my Department on a number of occasions and it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to introduce regulations requiring the mandatory use of child resistant containers for all medicinal products. While it is essential to ensure that children are protected from the risk of accidental poisoning by medicinal products, it is also necessary to ensure that the interests of persons with a disability, who may experience difficulties with this type of product, are taken into account. If a regulation were to be introduced in this area, the number of exemptions which would be required would effectively render such a regulation impractical. It is therefore more appropriate to protect children in this instance by a professional code of practice such as that introduced by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is a requirement under the Medicinal Products ( Prescription and Control of Supply ) Regulations 2003 that all dispensed medicinal products carry a warning advising that such products should be kept out of the reach of children. Accordingly, parents and others responsible for the care of children should ensure that all medicinal products, or indeed any potentially harmful substances, are stored in an area which is inaccessible to children.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of educational services, including school placement, transport and the provision of special needs assistants, resource teachers etc. for children with special needs is, as the Deputy is aware, a matter for the Department of Education and Science. The health services provide a range of health related support services for children with special needs, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, social work and, in some cases, nursing. Additional funding amounting to approximately &euro;16 million has been provided since 1998 for services to children with intellectual disability and those with autism. Children with physical or sensory disabilities <Col N="486"/>would also have benefited from the additional funding provided for those services in recent years.</P><?oasys _ah?>
    <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to children and adults with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places. Last year the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increases in speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the three year period to end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increases in speech and language therapists.</P><?oasys _xh?>
    <P>While there has been significant progress in enhancing the health related support services available to children with special needs, there is a need for a continued programme of investment in this area.</P>

	<P>The issue of provision of play facilities for children in Ireland has been addressed in the recently published Ready, Steady, Play: A National Play Policy. This policy, published on 8 March, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland, with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood. At the launch of the policy, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced details of a &euro;1 million grant scheme for local authorities. The purpose of the scheme, which is being jointly administered by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, NCO, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is to enhance the provision of publicly provided playgrounds around the country through the development of new and refurbishment of existing playgrounds.</P>
    <P>The scheme comprises of two stages. Under stage 1, applications for funding where sought from all city and county councils in March. Local authorities were asked to nominate one project and to agree to fulfil a number of criteria relating to it. The closing date for this stage has now passed. Applications successful in this stage will be invited to proceed to the second stage which involves the local authorities putting forward a more detailed outline of their proposal. It is expected that the results of stage 1 will issue shortly. Wexford County Council made an application in regard to a project in Templeshannon, Enniscorthy. The NCO and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have begun the evaluation of the applications and a letter will issue shortly indicating whether the Wexford County Council proposal was successful in stage 1. It is anticipated that a final decision on which local authority will be receiving a grant, as well as the level of the grant, will be made in June. At this point the NCO will indicate to successful city and county councils what level of funding will be made available to them.</P>
    <P>The funding for the scheme is held in the vote of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the money will be disbursed by that Department. No other grant scheme in relation to playgrounds is being administered by the National Children&rsquo;s Office or the Department of Health and Children at present.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposed public private partnership project in the Southern Health Board. The project is for eight community nursing units, CNUs, which will provide an additional 400 beds for respite, convalescence, long stay and rehabilitation services, to elderly patients in the Southern Health Board area. A central services unit, CSU, was originally included as part of the project however, in view of the health sector reform programme it has been agreed with the board that the CSU will not be included as part of the public private partnership project. It will be considered separately in the context of the health services reform programme.</P>
    <P>Under the public private partnership arrangement proposed for this project, a private sector consortium will enter into a long term contract of approximately 25 years with the southern health board to design, build, finance and partially operate the CNUs. The clinical services will be provided by the health board. The board is currently in consultation with my Department and is in the process of finalising its public sector benchmark, PSB. The PSB is a comprehensive, detailed, risk adjusted costing of the project elements using conventional procurement over the whole life of the project. When the PSB is finalised it will be submitted to the Department of Finance for approval to proceed to the next phase of the project, which will be to advertise in the Official Journal of the European Union for a consortium to deliver the project.</P>
    <P>The full cost of the project will not be known until a preferred bidder is selected. Funding for the health board to develop the CNUs will then be considered in the context of capital and revenue resources available to my Department.</P>

	<P>The health service reform programme provides for the modernisation of the health service and the achievement of the goals and objectives of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. The Health (Amendment) Bill 2004, which was published on 16 April 2004, represents a further phase in the implementation of the reform programme. It provides for the termination of office of the members of the seven health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and its three area health boards. The Bill also assigns the functions, which are currently carried out by the members of the boards or authority to their chief executive officers or the Minister, as appropriate. The Bill is an interim measure and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is my intention to publish a second Bill later in the year to provide for the establishment of the health service executive, HSE, and the health information and quality authority, HIQA, on a statutory basis. This further legislation will also provide the legislative basis for other aspects of the reform programme such as improved governance and accountability, planning and monitoring and evaluation. My intention is to have this legislation introduced by December 2004 so as to have the health services executive in place in January 2005.</P>

Doing so might prejudice the negotiating position of the NTPF on resolving difficulties being experienced in the referral of patients to the fund. As I have previously pointed out, it is still open to patients or GPs to contact the NTPF directly to inquire about treatment and to make the necessary arrangements.

	<P>The House is aware that while there is no legislation regulating the area of IVF, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council which deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with IVF. These guidelines are the statutory responsibility of the council and I have no responsibility in the matter. I am, however, conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate the range of issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including IVF. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, I established a commission on assisted human reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference. The commission was directed to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
    <P>In its deliberations, I understand that the commission has taken account of the legislative framework in other jurisdictions, including Italy. The issues under consideration by the commission are complex and, while it is nearing completion of its work, it is not possible to be definitive at this stage in relation to when exactly it will finalise the report. The publication of the commission&rsquo;s report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

	<P>The report of the taskforce on assaults on psychiatric nurses was completed in 2003. In addition to quantifying the level of assaults and making recommendations in relation to prevention, the report contained proposals for a scheme of compensation for psychiatric nurses who have been seriously injured as a result of an assault by a patient in the workplace. As part of its deliberations, the taskforce considered the compensation schemes applying to garda&iacute; and prison officers. Government approval would be required for the introduction of any new State compensation scheme, which would be additional to the existing serious physical assaults scheme. In late 2003, a draft memorandum for Government was circulated and, during the consultation process, complex legal and financial issues emerged in relation to aspects of the scheme proposed by the taskforce and their implications for the health service and the wider public service.</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 3 March, I updated the Psychiatric Nurses&rsquo; Association and SIPTU on particular concerns that had been raised in relation to the proposed scheme. My officials are continuing discussions with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General and I expect to be in a position to provide a <Col N="493"/>further update to staff representatives in the near future.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health authorities in the first instance. The aim of my Department is to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics in a sustainable way over the longer term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need &mdash; as happens under the existing guidelines. The guidelines were issued in 1985 and are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than in category B. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area, and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list; in fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted in some health boards due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients; consequently, a category C waiting list may not be maintained in some health boards. However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to address the shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service.</P><?oasys _cl11-?>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist <Col N="495"/>clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 of December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Finally, the chief executive officers of the health authorities have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004 there were 21,033 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and almost 4,000 extra children are getting treatment from health authorities since the end of 2001.</P>

    <P>The matters raised by the group concerned at the meeting in April 2002 were considered by my Department. A preliminary review of the schemes in place in a number of other countries was subsequently undertaken by my Department; this preliminary review involved a general overview of details of schemes in place in a number of other countries. This review was done <Col N="496"/>in order to establish general details of schemes already in existence; however, a detailed examination of such schemes has not yet been undertaken. My Department is keeping the position in relation to the possible establishment of an alleged vaccine damage compensation scheme under review. However, the developmental work which can be undertaken by my Department in 2004 is concentrated on four major themes: advancing the health reform programme, supporting the health aspects of the EU Presidency, legislation relating to health reform and other pressing areas including professional regulation, and monitoring of service plans and budget management by health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s policy on providing adequate services for patients suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is as set out in the report, An Action Plan for Dementia, published by the national council on ageing and older people in 1999. This commitment is endorsed in the 2001 health strategy, Equality and Fairness. A number of initiatives have been taken in relation to the improvement of dementia services. Significant additional funding has been made available for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers, including carers of Alzheimer sufferers. Additional funding has been made available to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland for expansion of its services, particularly day-care services. A number of new community nursing units for older people which have been constructed in recent years provide respite and day-care for people with dementia.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Although there are no regulations governing the purchase or use of medical lasers, any such devices in use in this country must carry the CE mark in compliance with EU Medical Devices Directive 1993/42/EEC and Statutory Instrument 252 of 1994 &mdash; European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations. Persons who avail of services whether cosmetic or otherwise should endeavour to seek the services of reputable institutions. When significant procedures, including those by medical laser, are being arranged in cosmetic clinics, persons are strongly advised to check that the services are provided <Col N="499"/>by or under the direction of a registered medical practitioner, and that such a doctor is appropriately registered with the Medical Council. Where difficulties are experienced in any non-medical practice where medical lasers are used, the appropriate point of complaint is the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>Where medical practice is concerned, the Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. Section 69(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, states: &ldquo;It shall be a function of the Council to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour&rdquo;. I am informed by the Medical Council of its view that doctors have been given the privilege of regulating their own professional affairs through the Medical Council and subject to the council&rsquo;s ongoing ethical guidance. Independent clinical decision making by doctors on behalf of their patients is a key part of how medicine operates in Ireland. The Medical Council&rsquo;s ethical guidelines are a set of ethical principles for medical practice which doctors must apply in each unique clinical situation in which they work, together with their judgement, experience, knowledge and skills. The question of appropriate advertising is also addressed, regarding which transgressions may constitute professional misconduct. It is the statutory duty of the council to consider all complaints in the event of any alleged lapses from such standards which may lead to fitness-to-practise proceedings.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. It is my intention that heads of Bill for an amendment to the 1978 Act, which are at an advanced stage, will a Bill be put before Cabinet in the very near future. As part of this review process, consultations have been carried out with a number of bodies, including patient groups, medical representative organisations, and the key stakeholders in health service provision, regulation and post-graduate medical education and training. Some of the main issues which have been considered are greater public interest representation on the Medical Council, measures to improve the public accountability and transparency of the council, improved efficiencies in the fitness-to-practise procedures and measures to ensure the ongoing competence of all doctors to engage in their profession and the procedures they undertake.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department as funding is allocated by the boards on a case-by-case basis. The Minister is aware of the concerns raised by parents. A number of the health boards have been working together with the Irish Society for Autism to address various concerns, including those raised by parents. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the South Western Area Health Board to reply directly to the Deputy on behalf of the various boards in relation to this matter.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>As the provision of this type of service has historically been supplied from the community care budget of the health board in the form of home help services etc., it is difficult to be precise about the budget for this type of care. However, in addition to this year&rsquo;s community care budget, the North Western Health Board has been allocated &euro;125,000 for the <Col N="502"/>purposes of providing personal care packages on a pilot scheme basis.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have been encouraging the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could possibly include the provision of a home help service, home subvention payments, arrangements for attendance at a day centre or day hospital and other services such as twilight nursing. Personal care packages allow older persons the option of remaining living in their own home rather than going into long-stay residential care. Additional funding of &euro;1.25 million was made available to the health boards this year for the introduction of personal care packages. This is on top of the significant expenditure currently being incurred on home help and other services aimed at supporting people at home.</P>

	<P>The chief executive officer of each health board has responsibility for the management of the workforce in public nursing homes, including the appropriate staffing mix, precise grades of staff employed in line with service priorities. It is a matter for each employer to ensure that staff in their employment have adequate training and skills to perform the duties expected of them. A major training initiative has begun in relation to the training of care attendants in the health sector, including those employed in public nursing homes. A pilot scheme has been completed and favourably assessed. The scheme of training has been rolled out throughout the health sector since autumn 2003. Over 500 care attendants have engaged in this phase of the training to date. There are a number of core modules to be undertaken by all trainees, along with other modules which pertain to their current employment.</P>
    <P>In the case of care attendants in the nursing home sector, the module &ldquo;Caring for the Older Person&rdquo; in particular will address their needs. This module will be available from September 2004. Training will be provided on a regional basis. It is a matter for each employer to manage the ratio of staff to patient in the services they <Col N="504"/>provide in light of their duty of care to patients. The inspection of private nursing homes is the responsibility of the health boards under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. Regulations made under this Act empower health boards to inspect private nursing homes. I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has established a working group comprising all stakeholders to review the operation and administration of the nursing home subvention scheme. As part of this review the working group will make recommendations on the development and implementation of quality care standards in institutional settings and examine all issues in relation to the regulation of private nursing homes, including the inspection process. It is intended that the inspection of both private and public long-stay facilities will fall under the remit of the social services inspectorate in due course.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that a key action, action 2.3.1, identified in the action plan for people management was to review the incidence of temporary contracts to ensure they were being used appropriately and, following this review, to examine the conversion of temporary staff to permanent as appropriate, which is designed to improve the quality of working life for health service employees. In any event, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 requires that fixed-term employees are not treated in any less favourable manner than comparable permanent employees in respect of their benefits and other conditions of employment. Responsibility for the management of the workforce including the review of temporary contracts rests with each of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of each health board and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the matters raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 598 to 600, inclusive, and 609 together.</P>
    <P>Prior to the implementation of the pre-registration nursing diploma programme, nursing students undertook a traditional apprenticeship model of nursing training, which was a certificate programme, and were paid a salary at the student rate by their training hospitals for the duration of their training. In 1994 the pre-registration nursing diploma programme commenced at a pilot site in <Col N="506"/>Galway and was subsequently implemented on a nationwide basis. Nursing students on the diploma programmes receive an annual means-tested maintenance grant as well as other financial supports. Students on this programme are entitled to receive a once-off book and uniform allowance at the commencement of the programme. Students are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated health institutions.</P>
    <P>In early 1998, a new allowance was introduced to assist students undertaking external clinical placements. An external clinical placement exists where the student has to undertake a placement in a health care setting which is not the hospital base of the student. Under the original terms of the scheme, a student was entitled to receive an external clinical placement allowance where it was necessary for her/him to obtain a second accommodation away from her or his normal place of residence for the duration of the placement. A student who did not require a second accommodation was entitled to a refund of the cost of travelling to and from the external clinical placement site. In 2000, this initiative was further extended, and students may now avail of both the external clinical placement allowance and a refund of the costs of travel where required. Details of the rates of the above allowances from the period 1994 to date are detailed below:</P><Col N="505"/>

    <P FLI="0">The maintenance grant was increased to &euro;4,850 in June 2003 in respect of the final two intakes of students to the diploma programme. Where applicable, increases in the maintenance grant came into effect on 1 June of the relevant years, while increases in the book and uniform allowances came into effect in September of the <Col N="506"/>relevant years. Payment of these allowances is the responsibility of the school of nursing in which the student trained. Funding has been provided to the schools by my Department.</P>
    <P>Intake to the nursing diploma ceased with the transfer of nursing education to the third-level sector in 2002, and the final graduation from the <Col N="507"/>diploma will be later this year. In 2002, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the recommendations of the commission on nursing, the pre-registration education of student nurses transferred into the third level sector. Students on the new degree programme have the same benefits as other third level students. Nursing degree students do not automatically receive a non-means-tested maintenance grant but, rather, may apply to the Department of Education and Science for a means-tested student grant under the scheme applying to all third-level students. Students on the nursing degree programme receive a once-off uniform allowance of &euro;203.16 which is payable in the first year of the programme. Students undertaking external clinical placements are entitled to a refund of the cost of transport to and from the placement site for the duration of the placement. Students are also entitled to receive an accommodation allowance up to, but not exceeding, &euro;50.79 weekly where it is necessary for the student to obtain accommodation away from her or his normal place of residence.</P>
    <P>Payment of the uniform and clinical placement allowances is the responsibility of the relevant health agencies. The conditions for payment of the clinical placement allowances are outlined in circular 9/2004 which recently issued from my Department. A further letter of clarification regarding the payment of allowances to undergraduate nursing degree students issued from my Department on 26 April 2004. It should be noted that undergraduate nursing degree students do not receive book or meal allowances.</P>

	<P>The review is taking into account issues arising from the interpretation of certain aspects of the 1990 Act and the subvention regulations which have arisen over the years, the ombudsman&rsquo;s comments on the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme, the recommendations in the O&rsquo;Shea and Mercer reports and the views of clients and service providers on the operation of the scheme. The aims and objectives of the review are to recommend any changes necessary in the light of Professor O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s recommendations, to make recommendations on an equitable means assessment test for subvention, to make recommendations on the development of a standardised dependency test, to examine alternative care settings such as home care and to make recommendations for the funding of such care settings as an alternative to long-term residential care and to make recommendations <Col N="508"/>on the development and implementation of quality care standards in institutional settings. The ultimate aim of the review will be the development of a system which will be transparent, provide equity, be less discretionary and financially sustainable.</P>
    <P>The review group has been working for a number of months and is comprised of a wide variety of stakeholders representing the many and varied interests associated with long-term care. The group has been hearing submissions from interested parties and has almost completed this process. The group has also benefited from hearing from the authors of the above mentioned reports. The group will now move on to looking at the specific terms of reference and decide how and in what order it should begin to address these. The group will be guided in this by the submissions from various stakeholders as well as the recommendations outlined in the O&rsquo;Shea and Mercer reports.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum&rsquo;s report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly, the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at 1 part per million, human health is not adversely affected, dental fluorosis &mdash; a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel &mdash; is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In all, the report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. The establishment of the expert body recommended by the forum is now well under way. The body will be known as the Irish expert body on fluorides and health. It will be chaired by Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Hickey, former chief dental officer with my Department. Dr. <Col N="509"/>O&rsquo;Hickey&rsquo;s mix of scientific knowledge, awareness of fluoridation issues and experience of administrative issues leaves him well placed to chair the body. I understand that the inaugural meeting of the expert body is on 29 of April 2004.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the expert body are to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his or her request or on own initiative. The expert body is to have broad representation, including from the areas of dentistry, public health medicine, toxicology, engineering, management, environment and the public as identified within the forum on fluoridation report. A research project on fluoride delivery systems, which includes an investigation into fluoride intake in the Irish population, is currently being undertaken at the Oral Health Services Research Centre, OHSRC, in University College Cork. As part of this project, the OHSRC is developing methods to be used when measuring fluoride ingestion in the population. One of the areas of research being pursued is the development of standardised methods for measuring fluoride content of samples of saliva, urine, serum, fingernail clippings and mineralised tissues. These studies are being undertaken in close collaboration with researchers in Europe and the USA to ensure that the methods being used conform to international standards. The results of this research and the commencement of any further research in the future &mdash; such as a random testing programme of fluoride levels in the Irish population including children &mdash; will be a matter for consideration by the Irish expert body on fluorides and health.</P>

	<P>The majority of voluntary organisations providing health and personal social services are funded by health boards and it is a matter for each health board within the service planning requirement to agree the levels of service and the appropriate funding in respect of each such organisation. In determining the extent of agency services, each health board must operate within the levels of funding approved and the employment ceiling <Col N="511"/>set. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief executive officers of each health board or authority to reply directly to the Deputy with the details relevant to their board or authority. On the action plan for people management, APPM, &euro;120,000 was made available under this heading in 2003 for management training in the national federation of voluntary bodies. An additional &euro;2 million was allocated to the health boards in 2003 for APPM implementation. Since my Department is not directly involved in the application of this funding within the voluntary sector I have requested the chief executive officers of each health board and of the ERHA to reply directly to the Deputy on this aspect.</P>
    <P>Currently, one voluntary hospital, St. John&rsquo;s Hospital, Limerick, receives funding directly from my Department. The revised level of determination approved for St. John&rsquo;s Hospital for 2003 is &euro;17.727 million. The actual employment level at end December 2003 was 328 whole-time equivalents.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the pay awards recommended under the public service benchmarking body, PSBB. The commission on nursing, which reported in 1998, considered that public health nurses, PHNs, operated at the level of clinical nurse specialist. In its submission to the PSBB, the Alliance of Nursing Unions, representing the Irish Nurses Organisation, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, IMPACT and SIPTU Nursing, made a claim to have the PHN grade paid a differential of 10% over the rate of pay ultimately recommended for the clinical nurse manager 2, CNM2. At that time, PHNs were paid at the same rate as CNM2 plus a qualification allowance. Clinical nurse specialists are paid at the same rate as CNM2s. On the statement contained in the report of the Commission on Nursing, the Nursing Alliance stated &ldquo;Clearly, it was not considering the issue of pay rates for either grade but was merely making a statement of the unique role played by the PHN.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The PSBB, which issued its report in 2002, recommended an increase of 9.2% for the PHN grade and an increase of 12.2% for the clinical nurse manager 2-clinical nurse specialist grade. The benchmarking process established new absolute levels of pay for nursing and other public service grades and, furthermore, ensured that no benchmarked grade may receive a further increase as a consequence of the body&rsquo;s <Col N="512"/>recommendations as they effect any other grade, whether benchmarked or not. In recognition of their qualifications, all PHNs are paid a qualification allowance of &euro;2,422 per annum and PHNs who were in employment on 16 November 1999 are paid a further red-circled allowance of &euro;1,390 per annum on top of basic salary.</P>

     <QRef>[11955/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position on the commission on nursing is that two of its recommendations made reference to nurse staffing levels &mdash; paragraphs 7.63 and 9.4. It has been decided to address these recommendations together. A working group has recently been established, chaired by the chief nursing officer of my Department and including representatives of the health service employers agency, the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, the Irish Nurses Organisation, SIPTU Nursing, IMPACT, employing agencies and the Department of Health and Children. The terms of reference of the group are to agree a common understanding of the term skill-mix in the health care environment and its application in determining nursing staff levels; to identify and evaluate the current systems being utilised in the Irish health care setting and identify areas of best practice; to review literature in relation to the current systems of determining nursing staff levels in a national and international context and to determine whether these systems have the potential to be adopted or modified to suit the Irish health care system and to recommend principles underpinning systems of determining nursing staff levels within the Irish health care system.</P>
    <P>Standards of care in private nursing homes are governed by the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, and, as such, responsibility for staffing issues in private nursing homes is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. My Department is currently reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations to determine their relevance and efficacy in providing long-term care to the elderly. However, the procedures for evacuating homes in the event of a fire are contained in the health and safety statement of the relevant health board or <Col N="513"/>authority and are, therefore, an operational matter for the health board or authority concerned.</P><?oasys _cl10.5-?>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health authorities in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is <Col N="514"/>manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Orthodontic Initiative funding of &euro;4.698 million was provided to the health authorities in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health authorities specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The chief executive officers of the boards have informed my Department of the following information on their treatment waiting lists at the end of March 2004:</P><Col N="513"/>

     <QRef>[11980/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues raised in the correspondence referred to by the Deputy in relation to baseline health data arise from a report published by the health research board, HRB, in 2003. The report, Health and Environmental Effects of Landfilling and Incineration of Waste &mdash; A Literature Review, was commissioned by the HRB at the request of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government. With regard to human health impacts the report concluded that there were information gaps in respect of monitoring of the health of people living near waste sites. The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, published in 2001, recognises the need to address issues in this area. Under the strategy, the national health information strategy, NHIS, will be published and implemented. This strategy is currently being finalised. A principal motivation behind the development of the NHIS has been the recognition of significant gaps and deficiencies in health information. The NHIS will therefore make recommendations to address these issues through a range of initiatives and structural changes.</P>
    <P>Despite recognised deficiencies, it should be emphasised that many existing information systems contribute significantly to the monitoring and evaluation of population health. Baseline human health data are  routinely collected through the vital statistics registration system. Other national data sources also available at regional, county and sometimes DED level include data from the national cancer registry, the hospital in-patient inquiry system, SLAN, the national disease surveillance centre and the perinatal reporting system. The congenital birth anomalies registries in Ireland cover areas accounting for over 60% of the births occurring. <Col N="517"/>The public health information system produced by the Department of Health and Children for the directors of public health brings together a range of data, including many of the sources above.</P>

	<P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, there has been a total cumulative investment of &euro;550 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in staffing and activity which has occurred. For example, the investment has enabled the funding of an additional 91 consultant posts in key areas of cancer care such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care and general surgeons with a special interest in breast surgery. In addition approximately &euro;90 million has been invested in oncology infrastructure, including specialist equipment in radiation oncology, mammography, radiology and pathology. The recruitment and training of specialist staff and the utilisation of <Col N="518"/>equipment is a matter for individual health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA.</P>

	<P>A motorised transport grant, MTG, of up to 75% of the actual cost of purchasing or adapting a car, which takes into account the trade-in value of a car being replaced, may be provided up to a limit of &euro;4,575. Where a person qualifies for both the MTG and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, the MTG grant payable should not exceed the net outlay incurred, taking into account the benefit from the scheme. The means of the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s spouse or partner, if any, are taken into account. Means are determined on the basis of gross income less statutory deductions and allowances in respect of rent and mortgage repayments, but include income from assets, investments, lettings etc. The following are not considered as means; an allowance received from an organisation approved by the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment while undergoing a course of rehabilitative or vocational training; blind welfare allowance; carers allowance or benefit; child benefit; domiciliary care allowance; foster care allowance; higher education grants; income up to a maximum amount approved in employment of a therapeutic or rehabilitative; nature; living alone allowance; moneys received from charitable organisations other than remuneration; special compensation awards exempted by legislation, including those for hepatitis C and <Col N="520"/>thalidomide; supplementary welfare allowance and travel and meal allowances paid to participants on Government approved schemes.</P>
    <P>Any net income in excess of the national average industrial wage which is currently &euro;26,940.16 is deducted from the maximum grant payable of &euro;4,575 on a euro by euro basis. The assessment of and entitlement to the motorised transport grant including an appeal in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Applications for this grant should be made directly to the health board. The applicant may also be eligible for assistance through the aids and appliances budget. He or she should contact his or her local health board for details.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I explained in the reply referred to by the Deputy that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, holds records manually and electronically for active donors, lapsed donors and donors who have been excluded from donation for one reason or another. The IBTS does not remove records from its database as it may need access to a donor&rsquo;s records for look-back to trace previous donations, should the need arise. The EU directive on blood quality and safety stipulates that donor records must be retained for a minimum period of 30 years to allow for full traceability. The IBTS uses its client database to contact donors when required and to encourage eligible donors to donate again. It is not uncommon for an individual to donate one or more times before allowing donations to lapse. When contacted by the IBTS, some donors welcome the opportunity to begin donating again.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, unless the family of a donor contacts the IBTS to it that the donor has died, the service has no way of ascertaining this <Col N="522"/>information. I am assured that the IBTS regrets any distress caused to the families of deceased donors by this practice.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 67 of the Health Act 1970, the children eligible for health board dental services are pre-school and national school children in respect of defects noted at child health examinations. Child health examinations are provided by health boards to children attending national school in accordance with section 66 of the Act. There is provision under section 66(3) for a health board, at its discretion, to provide child health examinations to children attending a school that is not a national school. Such discretion may be applied once the governing body of the school so requests.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act 1994 amended the Health Act 1970. The regulations made under this Act &mdash; the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations, 2000 &mdash; extended eligibility for free primary dental care to children up to their sixteenth birthday, who have attended a national school or a school standing specified in an order under section 66(3) of the Health Act 1970. As part of the implementation process for the national health strategy, a review of all existing eligibility legislation is being undertaken in my Department. Arising from this review, legislation will be drafted to clarify and simplify eligibility and entitlements to health services in <Col N="523"/>line with the goals and objectives set out in the strategy.</P>

     <QRef>[11122/04]</QRef>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 635, 636, 638 and 639 together.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sequencing of the east-west runways, the long-term development plan for Dublin Airport, as envisaged in the late 1960s, included the construction of two such runways, one to the north of the terminal and a second to the south of this area as and when traffic growth required it. In 1980, a committee comprising representatives of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the Department of Transport was tasked with recommending a plan for runways at Dublin Airport to meet its long-term needs. The committee recommended the construction of the south runway first, on the basis of better visibility of eastern approaches of the runways, reduced taxiing distances to and from the central terminal area and the facility to handle general aviation on the existing runway 12/30. I understand that considerable weight was also attached to the views of the planning officials in the then local planning authority, Dublin County Council, in favour of the construction of the south runway first. The runway was subsequently opened for traffic in June 1989.</P>
    <P>In the context of preparing the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill 1997, consideration was given to providing Aer Rianta with the power to make orders declaring particular areas of land in the vicinity of airports to be protected areas, where unrestricted use of such lands could interfere with the safety of aircraft. The power to make such orders rested with the Minister under section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950. In the course of consultations on the drafting of the Bill, however, it was decided that the <i>status quo</i> operated satisfactorily and the ministerial power <Col N="526"/>under the 1950 Act to make protected area orders was retained and remains in force.</P>
    <P>I understand from Aer Rianta that its consultation brochure of October 2002 was produced as part of the public information process associated with the preparation of an environmental impact statement to accompany a future runway planning application to the local planning authority. The other documents referred to by the Deputy were produced for different purposes. Regarding the portrayal of the length and respective end points of the proposed second parallel runway, I am not aware of any significant differences between Aer Rianta&rsquo;s consultation brochure and the final ERM report, which was formally submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and me last September. The Llewelyn-Davis report, which I understand was an interim report, was commissioned by Fingal County Council and it is a matter for that authority to satisfy itself as to an acceptable level of accuracy of technical data given the main purpose of the report.</P>
    <P>The issue which the Deputy has raised relating to a planning proposal at Cloghran, County Dublin, falls within the remit of Aer Rianta and the planning authorities.</P>

The projection of the approach surface for a non-instrument runway on to a plan area would result in an inner edge that is 150 m wide. The cross runways at Cork Airport and Shannon Airport have been protected as instrument runways.</P>

	<P>As part of the public consultation process before it finalised its report, Environmental Resources Management Limited published a draft report on public safety zones in June 2003. In annexes C, D, and E of the report, dealing with aircraft movements at Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports respectively, there are tables which <Col N="528"/>outline the numbers of aircraft movements used in calculating the public safety zones being proposed by ERM. The tables, which are summarised in tabular format below, set out the estimated future annual maximum number of aircraft movements at those airports. The final ERM report, which was submitted to the Departments of Transport and Environment, Heritage and Local Government in September 2003, is still being examined. The figures in the tables in the final version of the report are the same as those in the draft version which was published in June 2003.</P><Col N="527"/>

     <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 128, 129 and 130 of 1 April 2004, he will reply as to the reason Dungarvan, County Waterford, has the longest waiting time for a driving test in Europe; the reason Waterford has the second longest waiting time for a driving test in Europe; the reason the average waiting time for a driving test is 40 weeks in the Republic of Ireland while in Northern Ireland it is a month to six weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 122 of 25 March last, 13 driver testers are assigned to the south-east region covering ten driving test centres, including Dungarvan and Waterford. The level of service at the test centres is generally consistent with service levels in other centres. The allocation of driver testers to test centres is kept under review, having regard to the demand for tests. The waiting times at the Waterford and Dungarvan centres are being addressed in this context.</P>
    <P>The overall numbers awaiting a driving test nationally have risen because of an above average increase of 21% in applications in 2003 compared <Col N="528"/>to 2002. There are indications that applications have returned to normally expected levels, however. I anticipate that waiting times will improve over the coming year. A bonus scheme for driver testers to help to address the backlog was introduced in May 2003 and terminated in November 2003. The possibility of introducing a further bonus scheme in 2004 is being considered. In addition to the bonus scheme, eight retired driver testers were re-employed with effect from 13 October 2003. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and on weekends. Preparation of legislation to establish a driver testing and standards authority, which will take on responsibility for conducting driving tests and will have more flexibility to respond to variations in demand, is at an advanced stage. I expect to be in position to submit the text of the Bill to the Government shortly.</P>

     <asker>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
     <Quest>the existing fine for each of the current parking offences.</Quest>
     <QRef>[11151/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where a person is convicted in court of illegal parking he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;800 <Col N="529"/>for a first offence, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 for a second or subsequent offence and if a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months the person is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both. The determination of the actual fine to be imposed in each particular case is a matter for the courts. The offence of illegal parking comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system. The amount of the on-the-spot fine applicable to this offence is &euro;19. If an on-the-spot fine notice is issued, it is open to the person to whom the notice is addressed to pay the relevant amount to avoid the matter proceeding to court.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system, which already applies to the offences of exceeding a speed limit and breaching the requirements for the use of seat belts, brings greater certainty to the application of administrative charges in respect of offences. It features, in particular, the provision that the original amount of the fixed charge will automatically increase by 50% if payment is not made within 28 days of the date of the original notice. The roll-out of the system to the majority of traffic and parking offences including the offence of illegal parking is being progressed in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities. I envisage that this process will feature the updating of the charges associated with parking offences generally including this offence.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 644 and 645 together.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, that its advisory committee has not ceased to exist. Its most recent term of appointment expired on 31 December 2003, however. The reappointment of the committee depends, in the first instance, on notification to the DTO by represented agencies of nominees for appointment for the new term. The DTO is awaiting outstanding information from some of the represented agencies in this regard. In the meantime, I will make arrangements for the reappointment of the committee, based on the nominations received to date. The DTO advisory committee was established in March 2000. I understand from the DTO that two members of Dublin City Council were nominated at the time to serve on the committee. A total of 12 meetings of the committee have taken place since 16 March 2000, the last of which took place on 7 May 2003. I understand from the DTO that both public representatives were invited to attend each of the meetings held. The DTO has informed me that the minutes from each meeting record that neither of the councillors attended any of the meetings that were held.</P>

    <P>As I said in my reply to Question No. 327 of 6 April last, Area Development Management Limited, which administers the rural transport initiative on behalf of my Department, is undertaking an appraisal of the scheme. It will be an appraisal of the entire initiative, which covers 34 separate projects, including the project operated by the south Westmeath rural transport association. The appraisal is expected to be completed by the summer. The primary objective of the appraisal is to identify the key impact of the scheme and policy lessons that have emerged from its implementation. When the appraisal has been completed, I will consider the findings and take whatever decisions are appropriate with regard to the continuation of the initiative and the funding of rural transport projects generally and in good in time for the period after 2004.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works has been actively seeking suitable accommodation sites for the National Roads Authority in Ballinasloe. Discussions between my Department, the OPW and the NRA will begin shortly to identify a suitable site based on this work. The report of the decentralisation implementation group, which was published on 7 April 2004, recommended that a central applications facility be established to identify staff who wish to decentralise to the various locations. NRA staff will have access to this facility which, when operative, will make it possible to identify the numbers of staff who wish to decentralise with the NRA. The NRA is working on an implementation plan and will report to the implementation group.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 was enacted in July 2003 to provide a legislative basis for the establishment of a Commission for Taxi Regulation and an advisory council to the commission. Section 14 of the Act requires that the commissioner for taxi regulation be selected by means of an open recruitment competition held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Following a competition for the post of commissioner in 2003, the Civil Service <Col N="534"/>and Local Appointments Commission was unable to recommend a candidate for appointment. A further recruitment competition on the basis of an enhanced salary for the position is being progressed by the commission. The closing date for applications was 4 March 2004 and interviews for the position took place recently. I am awaiting a response from the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission regarding the outcome of the interview process.</P>

I understand that airlines&rsquo; requirements about forms of identification acceptable to them are clearly set down in the terms and conditions provided to passengers when, for instance, booking and purchasing tickets for low cost air transport to the UK.

Any other Luas signage, including tram stop names, will be in accordance with industry best practice, with an emphasis on symbology and incorporation of bilingual text where required.</P>

	<P>I have received a request from Wicklow County Development Board for additional funding for the Wicklow rural transport initiative and have responded in the matter. Area Development Management Limited, ADM, is managing the RTI on behalf of my Department and I have copied this correspondence to ADM for its information.</P>
    <P>There has been no reduction in the funding provided by my Department for the rural transport initiative, RTI. On the contrary, while &euro;4.4 million was earmarked for the RTI in the national development plan, some &euro;6 million has already been provided for the initiative in the two year period ending December 2003 and further funding of &euro;3 million is being provided in 2004. Specific allocations for individual RTI projects are made from this funding by ADM.</P>
    <P>I understand that the allocations to date from ADM do not include funding arising from the application of the free travel scheme to the RTI in 2004 or any funding which individual projects might acquire from other sources. In addition to the funding from my Department, I understand that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will provide up to &euro;500,000 for the operation of the free travel scheme in the RTI in 2004. ADM is in the process of contacting the RTI groups as regards the individual allocations from this funding.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659 and 671 together.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system, which is provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002, was introduced with effect from 31 October 2002 for the offence of breaching a speed limit, from 1 June 2003 for insurance offences and from 25 August 2003 for seat belt wearing offences. Penalty points are applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of such offences and, in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences, to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. As <Col N="537"/>of 6 April 2004, penalty points have been endorsed in respect of 128,966 drivers.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Act provides that the endorsement of penalty points can only occur following the receipt of a notification that a person has been convicted of the commission of a penalty point offence or has paid a fixed charge.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the issue of notification following a conviction for a penalty point offence rests with the Courts Service and, where a fixed charge is paid, with the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There is no basis for a refund of a fixed payment provided for in the Road Traffic Acts. The only basis for the removal of penalty points provided for in the Act is where a court accepts a late appeal from a person convicted of a penalty point offence and following the hearing of the appeal sets aside the original conviction. To date no driver has had penalty points removed from his or her driving licence record.</P>
    <P>As of 6 April 2004, some 18,000 drivers of vehicles, apprehended under the penalty points system and who have paid their fixed charge, do not have points endorsed on their driver licence records. The reasons that these drivers do not have points endorsed on their driver licence records include not holding a driving licence and the non-holding of an Irish driving licence. A record is opened in the national driver file recording details of the offence and the number of penalty points applicable are held in abeyance. Should the driver apply for an Irish driving licence at a later date, the points then become live and will be endorsed on the licence record for a three-year period.</P>

	<P>Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, are not subject to fare controls under the public service vehicles regulations. In the case of taxis, the fare is generally established at the end of the hire by reference to the taximeter and any other legal charges. However, in the case of hackneys, the fare should be agreed on a private hire basis in advance, as the hire should not involve the vehicle either standing or plying for hire. Accordingly, it is a matter for the person hiring a hackney to agree the fare for a journey in advance, including the manner of its calculation.</P>

	<P>The location of stations on the rail network is a matter for Irish Rail. The company informs me that it has examined the case for re-opening Dunleer station on a number of occasions in the past. A review of the Dublin suburban rail strategy, conducted on behalf of the company, concluded that the station would only have very modest daily boardings given the population of the area. However, a new development plan has been approved for Dunleer, which involves significant population growth. While I understand that Irish Rail has not yet seen the revised development plan, the company has indicated that it is prepared to re-examine its position regarding the re-opening of the station if the plan is adopted and funding can be provided from developers.</P>

However, there are some concerns about the close proximity of the two stations and, in any event, a new station would have to be supported by high-density development within its immediate area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 673 and 674 together.</P>
    <P>Integration between transport modes plays an integral part in providing a cohesive and efficient public transport network and I would encourage all operators to co-operate in providing linkages wherever practicable. However, the decision to provide a bus service and the level of that service is a day-to-day matter for the operators themselves and my Department has no function in deciding the services to be introduced. I am aware that Dublin Bus and the Railway Procurement Agency have held discussions regarding the linking of relevant bus services with Luas.</P>
    <P>Since 10 January 2001 Dublin Bus is required to notify my Department at least four weeks in advance of the introduction of a proposed service or of any alterations to existing services. Similarly, under the Road Transport Act 1932, a private operator must submit an application to my Department for a route licence to operate services on a specified route. To date no formal applications from private operators or notifications from Dublin Bus have been received for the services outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. However, my Department is committed to dealing, as a matter of urgency, with all applications or notifications for bus services which are related to QBC development or Luas.</P>

	<P>The day-to-day administration of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 is undertaken by Area Development Management Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out thorough assessments of all applications for grant assistance under the programme, on my behalf. All large-scale capital projects are referred by ADM to an independent external building specialist to assess the suitability of the proposal and its value for money.</P>
    <P>There has been significant ongoing dialogue between the group in question and ADM with regard to this application. On completion of the assessment process this application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which will make a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>All counties have benefited from new projects and additional child care places under the programme. We now need to use the remaining capital funding to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline will be reviewed to ensure that those projects, which best meet the programme criteria and which can be completed by the end of the present programme, will receive priority. The ability to bring a project to fruition before the end of the present programme is an important criterion at this stage as I am aware that it can frequently take time to complete a project and there are constraints to ensure that we maximise our EU funding.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current <Col N="544"/>funding from Government for this key sector. Should additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the death of the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question occurred in February 2002 and was fully investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A file on the incident was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director of Public Prosecutions directed that one person be charged under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. The case was listed for trial in October 2003 and was remanded to December 2003 when the accused was convicted and fined &euro;250.</P>
    <P>I understand that the inquest in this case commenced in the coroner&rsquo;s court on 31 March 2004. After hearing a number of witnesses including the State pathologist, the coroner adjourned the inquest and requested the file be sent back to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the Garda is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. The director, who is <Col N="547"/>independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law. In the circumstances it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The visa applications in question were to enable a ten-year-old female and 13-year-old male to join a non-EEA national employed in the State under the work permit scheme. In general, persons employed in the State under this scheme may be joined by their spouse and their minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract of employment for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. In this instance, however, the children are not the children of the worker and therefore do not come within the scope of the scheme. I understand that, on their mother&rsquo;s side of the family, the children have three aunts and an uncle in their country of origin and that they are residing with one of these aunts.</P>
    <P>It was also noted that the information submitted in support of the applications stated that the children&rsquo;s parents were deceased and a death certificate was submitted in respect of the mother. No evidence was submitted as to the father of the children; further, the children each had different surnames, as did the sponsor. No documentation was submitted to show that the worker was in a position to fully support the children without the need for them to have recourse to public funds.</P>

    <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.

    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 692 and 748 together.</P><Col N="551"/>
    <P>Ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers have been used by terrorists to manufacture improvised explosive devices in this jurisdiction, and in Northern Ireland, for many years. For that reason, regulations were introduced in 1972 in both parts of the island declaring ammonium nitrate and some ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers to be explosives.</P>
    <P>In particular, Statutory Instrument 191 of 1972, Explosives (Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chlorate) Order 1972, declares that the substances specified in the schedule to the order shall be deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Explosives Act 1875. The schedule to the order includes, <i>inter alia</i>, ammonium nitrate and certain fertilisers, which contain ammonium nitrate in excess of 79% by weight. Under the terms of the order, these substances are deemed to be explosives within the meaning of the Act and are, therefore, subject to the same security controls for licensing, importation and storage as conventional explosives.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland order was amended in 1996 to state in essence that no one particle in a blended fertiliser may contain more than 79% by weight of ammonium nitrate. This means that if a blend contains a single granule or &ldquo;prill&rdquo; of ammonium nitrate it would fall within the remit of the order and would be declared an explosive.</P>
    <P>The question of amending the relevant order in this jurisdiction in line with the amended order in Northern Ireland was considered in 2000 but, following consultation with all relevant agencies, including the forensic science laboratory, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the State Laboratory, it was decided that such an amendment was not necessary.</P>
    <P>However, in the light of recent events and the concerns expressed over certain imports, officials of my Department, together with representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the State Laboratory, and the Forensic Science Laboratory, examined examples of these substances recently with the specific view to assessing the ease of segregation of ammonium nitrate from the blended fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Following this examination, further discussions amongst the relevant agencies are planned, and recommendations on control of the substances will be made to the relevant Ministers as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>As I indicated previously, in reply to Question No. 175 of 7 April 2004, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, in a judgment adopted on 9 March 2004, found that a breach of Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights had occurred in a case taken by a prisoner in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The prisoner, who is serving a sentence of life imprisonment, had complained that, as a convicted prisoner, he was subject to a blanket ban on voting in elections. This was as a result of legislation in the UK, section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which prohibits a convicted person from voting in a parliamentary or local election during the term of his or her detention in a penal institution. There is no such legislation in this country that prohibits a sentenced person from voting.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, while taking cognisance of the fact that there are no statutory provisions that prohibit a convicted prisoner from voting, has held that the State is under no constitutional obligation to facilitate prisoners in the exercise of that franchise. I have, however, brought the recent ruling of the ECHR to the attention of both the Attorney General and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who has primary responsibility for electoral legislation and I will consider the implications of the court&rsquo;s judgment in consultation with my colleagues.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 697 to 699, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the development of child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and training. For this purpose, &euro;436.7 million of funding was provided by the European Union and the Exchequer through the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP. Of this amount, the EU is contributing more than &euro;170 million of Structural Funds toward the programme. Following the mid-term reviews of the national development plan and the regional operational programmes through which its EU supports are channelled, the funding available for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 is due to increase from &euro;436.7 million to about &euro;449 million over the life of the programme. This requires the completion of some technicalities at the BMW and south east regional operational programme monitoring committees, which take place this week, following which the precise amounts of the funding increases will be available.</P>
    <P>I understand that approximately &euro;12 million of additional EU and Exchequer match funding will now be made available for child care following the mid-term review of the national development plan and its constituent operational programmes. This is both welcome and a testament to the achievements of the programme to date and the arrangements for these additional funds are being finalised this week. This will bring to almost &euro;449 million the commitment of public money to the development of child care over the life of the national development plan. This public <Col N="555"/>investment is also directly levering some private investment in the sector, estimated at approximately &euro;14 million.</P>
    <P>The EU funding is channelled through the two child care measures of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The aim of these measures is, <i>inter alia</i>, to increase the supply of child care places to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and training. In this respect the programme is expected to increase the supply of centre based child care places by at least 50% or 28,400 over a seven-year period.</P>
    <P>The EOCP has three funding strands: capital funding towards the creation of new and enhanced child care places; supports towards the staffing costs of community based facilities which support the child care needs of disadvantaged families; and supports which enhance the quality of Irish child care. The original allocations across these three measures &mdash; &euro;144.7 million for capital, &euro;217.1 million for staffing and &euro;74.9 million for quality improvement &mdash; were made at a time when there was little concrete information available on the actual needs in the areas covered by the three strands.</P>
    <P>As a result of the information now available on the demands under the three strands, the current mid-term review process is being used to increase the allocation towards the provision of capital investment by about &euro;15 million to maximise the long-term benefits of the programme throughout Ireland. Partly because it is being funded by some of the additional transferred money to which I referred earlier and partly because some of the projects are under construction, this increase will not draw down staffing grants as speedily as might originally have been expected.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the revised allocations to the three strands of funding are as follows: capital developments of approximately &euro;160 million; staffing supports of &euro;201.6 million; and quality initiatives of &euro;86.8 million. These amounts include an element of administration estimated at approximately 4%. Projects are selected on the basis of a range of criteria such as the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the group to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination of the project within the local community; and costings and value for money.</P>
    <P>With regard to the progress of the ECOP, I understand that over &euro;256 million has been allocated to projects under the programme to date. Of this amount, more than &euro;213 million has been allocated in capital and staffing funding for community based, not for profit groups and private child care providers while &euro;43 million has been allocated to quality improvement measures. Administration costs to date amount to approximately &euro;10 million. The funding allocated to date will, when fully drawn down, lead to the <Col N="556"/>creation of 28,392 new child care places &mdash; the programme target &mdash; and will support more than 26,642 existing places.</P>
    <P>The nature of the programme is such that much of the funding remaining on the staffing and quality strands will be required to help support the ongoing staffing costs of those community based projects, which are unlikely to be viable in the short to medium term because of the levels of disadvantage among their client groups, and to meet the ongoing costs of the quality enhancing structures such as the city or county child care committees and supports to the national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
    <P>My Department is finalising a detailed report on progress to date on the development of child care since the national child care strategy was adopted in 1999 and this will be available shortly. It will contain detail of all projects, which have been granted funding under the programme to the end of 2003 and I will be happy to forward a copy to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>All counties have benefited from new projects and additional child care places under the programme. We now need to use the remaining capital funding to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline will be reviewed to ensure that those projects, which best meet the programme criteria and which can be completed by the end of the present programme, will receive priority. The ability to bring a project to fruition before the end of the present programme is an important criterion at this stage as I am aware that it can frequently take time to complete a project and there are constraints to ensure that we maximise our EU funding.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with the use of so-called labour market supports for child care. We are all aware of the large body of research which shows that labour force participation and preparation for work through education and training are most beneficial in breaking the cycle of disadvantage. Certain community based child care facilities are unlikely to be sustainable in their own right in the foreseeable future due to the levels of disadvantage among their clients. All projects are encouraged to become sustainable but it is likely that some ongoing supports will be needed for those projects which help support the most disadvantaged to progress their careers and lifestyles to the point where they become self-reliant. For this reason, it makes good sense to <Col N="557"/>have funding for child care coming from labour market programmes, such as the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, the past four years have seen a very significant and welcome growth in the child care sector. The fruits of our investment under the national development plan are already to be seen on the ground and I am fully satisfied that the benefits and achievements of the present equal opportunities childcare programme will sow the seeds for its successor.</P>

	<P>The person in question arrived in the State in June 2000 and made an application for asylum. This application was unsuccessful. He also applied for residency on the basis of <Col N="558"/>parentage of an Irish child born in September 2001. The mother of the child is an Irish national.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases, which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered, but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to make a deportation order. In that context, a notification of a proposal to make a deportation order issued to the person in question on 11 March 2004 and he was given an opportunity to make representations regarding it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I decide not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Given the large number of such cases on hand, I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be further examined.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 is very complex and comprehensive legislation. For those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment. Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments: Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The national children&rsquo;s office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>Three main areas of the Act for which I have responsibility remain to be brought into operation. These concern the age of criminal responsibility, community-based options, and the provision of children detention centres for 16 and 17-year-old offenders.</P>
    <P>One of the primary aims of the Children Act is to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. The community-based options provided for in the Act will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in <Col N="559"/>situations where other diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the community-based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. The probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family in New Zealand for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required. It is the intention that community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented on a phased basis from June 2004.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17-year-old males and females who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</P>
    <P>In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles &mdash; 90 male and 20 female &mdash; is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Irish Prison Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, would not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 704 and 705 together.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station as at 26 April 2004 was 164 across all ranks. This represents an increase of 22, or 15.5%, in the personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since 31 December 1999. These resources are further augmented by the divisional traffic unit based in Terenure, and the Garda dog, air support and mounted units, which are utilised from time to time.</P>
    <P>At present 20 community garda&iacute; are allocated to ten specific neighbourhoods in Tallaght covering 43 neighbourhood watch schemes. The strength of each community police unit is reviewed periodically. There are three Garda youth diversion projects in the Tallaght Garda district namely: KEY, Key to Engaging Youth, Killinarden, Fettercairn and Glenshane; JAY, Jobstown Action for Youth; and YEW, Youth Enhancement in Whitechurch. A divisional crime prevention officer attached to Tallaght Garda station operates within the boundaries of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (South) Division. One Sergeant and four garda&iacute; are assigned JLO duties in the Tallaght Garda district.</P>
    <P>Some 19 marked and unmarked vehicles are allocated to Tallaght Garda station. Local management is satisfied that resources at Tallaght are sufficient to police the sub-district. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition Tallaght is also one of 17 locations set to receive town centre CCTV systems. Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources and must be viewed in the context of overall policing and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. They are not, nor are they intended to be, a replacement for garda&iacute; on patrol.</P>

My own Department has a clear responsibility for processing cases to the point where a deportation order is issued but the other Government bodies involved &mdash; the Chief States Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, and the Irish Prison Service &mdash; have wider responsibilities and it not possible to isolate the costs incurred by them solely in respect of their roles in deportations. For example, the GNIB is responsible for the prevention and detection of illegal immigration, maintaining border controls at airports and seaports and the registration of third country nationals legally residing in the State, as well as the removal of persons with deportation orders. Similarly, the Irish Prison Service accommodates other detainees, apart from those held pending deportation.</P>
    <P>However I can provide the Deputy with the costs of deportation flights, including charter flights, for the year 2003 and to date in 2004 as follows:</P><table>

    <P FLI="0">Based on the figures above, the average flight cost, including the cost of flights for the accompanying Garda escorts, per deportation <Col N="564"/>was &euro;2,660 in 2003 and &euro;2,053 in 2004. The cost in any particular case depends on the destination of return and the number of accompanying escorts, based on a prior risk assessment of the deportee by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB. Transport costs incurred by the GNIB within the State relating to deportations amounted to &euro;294,742 in 2003 and &euro;75,742 in the period January to March 2004 inclusive.</P>
    <P>Persons being deported are requested to report to the GNIB to make arrangements for their removal and are afforded every opportunity to co-operate with the Garda in their removal. It is only where they fail to co-operate or the Garda is of the opinion that they intend to evade the deportation order, that they are detained to ensure their removal from the State.</P>
    <P>The prescribed places of detention for persons to be held pending their deportation from the State are set out in SI 103 of 2002, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, an application prospectus on the community based CCTV scheme has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from my Department&rsquo;s Garda administration division.</P>
    <P>At the time the prospectus was published, both the technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, had not been finalised. As difficulties arose in finalising these documents it was not considered appropriate to make them available either via my Department&rsquo;s website or by other means. This action was taken to ensure that those groups, which wished to submit formal applications, did not put themselves to undue expense in compiling proposals, which ultimately might not be compliant with the technical and legal requirements of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Any individual or group who expressed an interest in the scheme was informed that no application could be considered until such time as both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised. They were further informed that their details were recorded and that my Department would issue copies of both documents to them as soon as the relevant <Col N="565"/>documents had been finalised. Any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed. It is anticipated that the technical specifications and the code of practice will be finalised shortly.</P>

     <Quest>the plans he has to extend the Employment Equality Act 1998 to ensure equal rates of pay between employees aged under 18 and those aged over 18 in view of the fact that it is unfair that the former group are generally paid lower rates.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in the area of employment and vocational training on nine grounds including the age ground. At present, section 6(2) of the Act excludes persons under the age of 18 years from the protection given against discrimination on the ground of age, except in regard to access to and participation in courses of vocational training to which the statutory school leaving age applies. As a result, the payment of different rates of remuneration to employees based on whether they are 18 years of age or less, does not constitute discriminatory treatment under the Act.</P>
    <P>Proposals to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 are before the Oireachtas under the Equality Bill 2004. The Bill seeks to amend the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act 2000 to take account of Council Directive 2000/43/EC, Council Directive 2000/78/EC and Directive 2002/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Section 4 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 6 of the Employment Equality Act which, on enactment, will extend the protection under the Act on the ground of age, to persons above the maximum age statutorily required for attendance at school. As a result, this will be the threshold for non-discrimination on the ground of age in conditions of employment including rates of pay</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, in December 2000, this project received approval for staffing funding of almost &euro;305,000 as a contribution towards its staffing costs for a three-year period from the equal opportunities childcare programme. Additional funding amounting to &euro;118,500 for a further year was allocated to the group in December 2003 and this represents a small increase on the group&rsquo;s previous funding from my Department. As a result, I do not understand the reference to a cut in funding in this context.</P>
    <P>I understand that the arrangements for the future funding of community groups whose initial contracts for staffing support have lapsed or are due to expire are under active review in my Department at present. It was in this context that a number of projects, including the Lourdes project, have been awarded ongoing funding at the same levels as they previously received to enable them to maintain their services pending the outcome of the review of the staffing measure.</P>

	<P>The persons in question arrived in the State on 17 June 2002 and claimed asylum. The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that they should not be declared as refugees and they were notified of this recommendation on 4 February <Col N="567"/>and 10 February 2003 respectively. The persons in question appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following an oral hearing, the original recommendation was affirmed and they were informed of this decision on 30 April 2003.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the persons concerned were informed on 18 June 2003 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons as to why they should not be deported that is be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State voluntarily before the order was made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received on behalf of the persons concerned. Their case file will be considered under a range of factors as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, including, <i>inter alia</i>, domestic circumstances, employment history and employment prospects.</P>
    <P>While pursuing their asylum claims, the persons concerned, on 21 August 2002, also applied for residency in the State on the basis of an Irish born child. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases, which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered &mdash; but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport them. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I decide not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Given the large number of such cases on hand, I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.</P>

	<P>Through the Government&rsquo;s local drug task force initiative, the Chrysalis community drug project in Benburb Street, Dublin 7, is currently in receipt of yearly funding of &euro;39,120 in respect of targeted work with drug-using women working in prostitution in the area. This funding is channelled via the Northern Area Health Board.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the probation and welfare service, also provides funding of &euro;300,000 per annum to the Ruhama Women&rsquo;s Project for its work with women involved in prostitution. In addition in 2003, a once-off grant of &euro;12,000 was provided to the Ruhama Project by my Department for its work with women who have been trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that under the equality for women measure of the national development plan, my Department approved funding of approximately &euro;380,000 in February, 2002 to the Ruhama Women&rsquo;s Project. The funding is for a three-year pilot project designed to develop a model of intervention, which will support and enable marginalised women to access education, training and the labour market.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 13 March 2003. At present the average processing time for applications for naturalisation is approximately 18 months. Consequently, it is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised in late 2004. I will inform the Deputy concerned as soon as I have reached a decision on the application.</P>

     <asker>Mr. G. Mitchell</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if a person (details supplied) who is in their eleventh year of imprisonment for murder, and persons in this category, have their applications for temporary release, such as at Christmas time, independently evaluated; and if the same independent evaluation applies to all persons who have been sentenced for serious crime.</Quest>
     <QRef>[11570/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not immediately clear to me what the Deputy means by &ldquo;independently evaluated&rdquo;. As he may be aware, persons serving life sentences for murder may have their cases reviewed by the Interim Parole Board after they have served seven years in custody. The board was established in April 2001 to advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the administration of long-term prison sentences and replaces the work previously carried out by <Col N="571"/>the sentence review group. The board, by way of recommendation to the Minister, advises of the prisoner&rsquo;s progress to date, the degree to which he or she has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of this sentence. I consider in full all recommendations put before me by the Interim Parole Board before making the final decision regarding sentence management.</P>
    <P>Individual requests for temporary release are made by prisoners from time to time for various reasons, such as Christmas, and these are considered on their merits as they arise. These requests are not referred to the Interim Parole Board. However, decisions on such individual requests will be consistent with the overall strategy for the management of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence.</P>
    <P>The case of the prisoner referred to by the Deputy, was last reviewed by the interim board in June 2003 and is due to be considered again in mid-2006. In the case referred to, bearing in mind the seriousness and circumstances of the crime, I have not been prepared to sanction any periods of temporary release to date.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the individual in question was arrested on 20 March 2003. On the following day, <Col N="572"/>he was remanded to District Court No. 46, Richmond Hospital, and was remanded in custody to Cloverhill District Court on 25 March 2003. On that date he made a fresh application for bail, which was refused by the court. On 31 March 2003, the person in question made a bail application to the High Court. Following a full hearing, the court refused bail. On 15 April 2003, the presiding judge at Cloverhill District Court refused jurisdiction in the case and he was sent forward for trial.</P>
    <P>On 27 July 2003, this individual made a fresh application for bail to the High Court, which was refused. A trial date was set for 23 October 2003, but on that date no judge was available to hear the case. A fresh application for bail was made to the High Court in December 2003. After hearing the full facts of the application, the court refused bail. Finally, on 15 January 2004 the person in question was acquitted by the jury at the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the decision as to whether to grant bail is a matter for the courts which are independent in the exercise of their functions and accordingly it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>the position on grant aid funding towards community based closed circuit television schemes, together with full details of the terms and conditions attached to such funding and the total amount available.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware a grant-aid scheme was launched to facilitate community-based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes. Subject to the availability of funds, grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. Within this cash limit, grants of up to <Col N="574"/>70% of the total capital cost of the system may be considered.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the conditions required to be met before an application for funding can be considered. All applications must be accompanied by a letter of approval for the project, signed by the local Garda divisional officer, that is chief superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All applications for funding must be signed by, or on behalf of, a legal entity representing the community-based group, for example a local authority, which will take responsibility for the supply, installation and commissioning of the proposed system. The participating local authority must also undertake to act as data controller for the purposes of data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>All proposed community-based CCTV systems must comply with the minimum technical and operational criteria as set out in a document entitled &ldquo;Technical Specifications&rdquo;. All proposed schemes must cover public areas to which the general public routinely have access. My Department will not provide grant assistance for purely private projects, for example shopping malls, private residences, other private property etc.</P><?oasys _cl11.3-?>
    <P>All valid applications received will not be automatically entitled to grant aid. Awards will <Col N="575"/>be at the discretion of my Department, subject to the availability of funds and the number of valid applications received. It is not possible to determine the level of funding that will be available for grant assistance under this scheme. The 2004 CCTV budget is more than &euro;4 million and includes expenditure on ongoing maintenance of Garda CCTV schemes as well as the implementation of current and planned schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department has received a significant number of expressions of interest &mdash; in excess of 200 &mdash; in the community-based CCTV scheme. An application prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from my Department&rsquo;s Garda administration division.</P>
    <P>A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised my Department will issue copies of it to all entities that expressed an interest in the community-based CCTV scheme and any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revoke a certificate of naturalisation in a number of specified circumstances. Those circumstances include cases where: the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances; or the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; or the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country; or the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship</P>
    <P>Before revoking a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister must give notice to the person to whom the certificate was granted of his intention, stating the grounds therefor and the right of that person to apply to him for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation. If the person in question makes such a request, the Minister is obliged to appoint a committee of inquiry consisting of a chairman having judicial experience and such other person as he may think fit, and refer the case to them. Thereafter the committee must report its findings to the Minister with a view to informing his decision.</P>
    <P>The revocation of a certificate of naturalisation is a serious matter and one in which the Minister must be in a position to show that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. It has never been the practice to comment on the details of individual cases and I do not intend to depart from that practice. If the Deputy, or indeed any Member of this House, is aware of any particular cases where the exercise of the Minister&rsquo;s power under section 19 may be appropriate, relevant details should be passed to me for investigation by the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that if the circumstances of any particular case warrant revocation under the above provisions, I will have no hesitation in utilising my statutory powers to the fullest extent possible.</P>

    <P>It was noted that the applicant is currently on six months unpaid leave from her employment. There was no satisfactory evidence submitted to show that she was in a position to fully support herself.

	<P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 733 and 736 together.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to comment on individual applications for asylum. As the Deputy will be aware, under the Refugee Act 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications and appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
    <P>A final decision will be made in this case upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The consideration of an appeal by the tribunal involves four stages: the assignment of the appeal to a member of the tribunal; the scheduling of a hearing; the completion of the decision by the member and the issuing of the decision to the applicant and his or her solicitor.</P>
    <P>The scheduling of a hearing is complex. Cases can only be scheduled for oral hearings following an examination of the file by a member of the tribunal under section 16(6) and (7) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. An appeal file is extensive and comprises a range of complex and detailed documents, including: the questionnaire completed by the applicant; notes of the interview between the applicant and an officer of the Refugee Applications Commissioner; section 11 &mdash; in some cases &mdash; and section 13 reports on the questionnaire and interview notes prepared by the commissioner&rsquo;s office; the recommendation of the commissioner; the notice of appeal; country of origin information; and any observations made to the tribunal by the commissioner or UNHCR.</P>
    <P>While the average length of time taken to process and complete a substantive appeal is at present approximately 16 weeks, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is continually striving to reduce this timeframe to reach those people in need of international protection as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The persons in question arrived in the State on 27 April 2000 and 8 August 2000, respectively, and claimed asylum. The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner <Col N="579"/>recommended that they should not be declared as refugees and they were notified of this recommendation on 15 November 2001. The persons in question appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following an oral hearing, the original recommendation was affirmed and they were informed of this decision on 20 September 2002.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the persons concerned were informed on 31 October 2002 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons as to why they should not be deported, that is be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State voluntarily before the order was made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the persons concerned. Their case file will be considered under a range of factors as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, including, <i>inter alia</i>, domestic circumstances, employment history and employment prospects. I expect their case files to be submitted to me for consideration shortly.</P>

	<P>Following the mid-term reviews of the national development plan and the regional operational programmes through which its EU supports are channelled, the funding available for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 is due to increase from &euro;436.7 million to approximately &euro;449 million over the life of the programme. This requires the completion of some technicalities at the BMW and south east regional operational programme monitoring committees, which take place this week, following which the precise amounts of the funding increases will be available.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the revised allocations to the three strands of funding are as follows: capital developments, approximately &euro;160 million; staffing supports, &euro;201.6 million; and quality initiatives, &euro;86.8 million. These amounts include an element of administration estimated at about 4%.</P>
    <P>Commitments entered into to date with local projects amount to &euro;213 million in capital and staffing funding for community based and not for profit groups and private child care providers, while &euro;43 million has been allocated to quality improvement measures. Administration costs to date amount to approximately &euro;10 million. The funding allocated to date will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of 28,392 new child care places &mdash; the programme target &mdash; and will support more than 26,642 existing places.</P>
    <P>The nature of the programme is such that much of the funding remaining on the staffing and quality strands will be required to help support the ongoing staffing costs of those community based projects, which are unlikely to be viable in the short to medium term because of the levels of disadvantage among their client groups, and to meet the ongoing costs of the quality enhancing structures such as the city county child care committees and supports to the national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
    <P>The EOCP is a seven-year rolling programme and the EU funding is available until end 2007 in the case of much of the south east region and 2008 for the border, midlands and western region. All projects, which have received grant assistance, are being monitored to ensure that they proceed as planned. The funding allocated to any project, which cannot proceed, will be de-committed and made available to another project.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that all the funding available will be drawn down at the earliest opportunity and no later than 2007. There is no question of any funding having been returned to the EU at any stage under the programme to date. I am fully committed to maximise the draw down of funding from the EU, including any additional funding which might come available on transfer, such as has recently benefited the programme as a result of the mid-term review of the national <Col N="581"/><?oasys _fc?>development plan and regional operational programmes.</P><?oasys _cl11.2-?>

    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that patrol cars in the Dublin Metropolitan Region are directed by communications centre to respond to complaints and calls from members of the public. Depending on the nature of the call, a priority classification is allocated to it that governs the sequence in which calls are responded to. Calls of a serious nature will obviously receive priority treatment. This system can result in the accumulation of calls in each district to be responded to when vehicles become available. Beat personnel are also utilised, when available to respond to calls.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that a response of 40 minutes would be an exception, and a concerted effort is made to provide a professional speedy response to calls at the first available opportunity.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not, understandably, possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for CCTV systems received by the CCTV advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters regarding CCTV systems, relate to relatively small schemes, which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P>
    <P>To this end, a grant-aid scheme has been launched to facilitate community-based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. <Col N="584"/>It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. Within this cash limit, grants of up to 70% of the total capital cost of the system may be considered. All valid applications received will not be automatically entitled to grant aid. Awards will be at the discretion of the Department, subject to the availability of funds and the number of valid applications received.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to determine the actual level of funding that will be available for grant assistance under this scheme. The 2004 CCTV budget is more than &euro;4 million and includes expenditure on the ongoing maintenance of current Garda CCTV schemes as well as the implementation of current and planned schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department has received a significant number of expressions of interest &mdash; in excess of 200 &mdash; in the community-based CCTV scheme. An application prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from the Department&rsquo;s Garda administration division.</P>
    <P>A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised the Department will issue copies of it to all communities, which expressed an interest in the community-based CCTV scheme and any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed.</P>
    <P>The value of Garda CCTV systems is principally as an aid to existing Garda resources. CCTV systems must, therefore, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. They are not &mdash; nor are they intended as a replacement for garda&iacute; on patrol. The systems have also been of proven assistance to the Garda in the identification of suspects, in facilitating a more efficient use of Garda resources and the better management of incidents.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is responsible for the development of child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and <Col N="586"/>training. For this purpose, &euro;436.7 million of funding was provided by the European Union and the Exchequer through the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP. Of this amount, the EU is contributing more than &euro;170 million of Structural Funds toward the programme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of elements, which have to come together to complete the review of the equal opportunities childcare programme. Because the EOCP is an element of the community support framework for Ireland and of the national development plan, it was also reviewed as part of the mid-term evaluations of the regional operational programmes through which its EU funding is channelled and as part of the NDP itself. It was also extensively reviewed by the NDP CSF evaluation unit. The implementation of the recommendations of these reviews requires decisions of the monitoring committees, which are taking place this week.</P>
    <P>Following the mid-term reviews of the national development plan and the regional operational programmes through which its EU supports are channelled, the funding available for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is due to increase from &euro;436.7 million to approximately &euro;449 million over the life of the programme. This requires the completion of some technicalities at the BMW and south east regional operational programme monitoring committees, which take place this week, following which the precise amounts of the funding increases will be available.</P>
    <P>I understand that approximately &euro;12 million of additional EU and Exchequer match funding will now be made available for child care following the mid-term review of the national development plan and its constituent operational programmes. This is both welcome and a testament to the achievements of the programme to date and the arrangements for these additional funds are being finalised this week. This will bring to almost &euro;449 million the commitment of public money to the development of child care over the life of the national development plan. This public investment is also directly levering some private investment in the sector &mdash; estimated at about &euro;14 million.</P>
    <P>My Department has carried out a detailed review of the budget lines for the entire programme to ensure that the amounts allocated under the different strands of the programme best meet the requirements for the development of the sector.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the revised allocations to the three strands of funding are as follows: capital developments, approximately &euro;160 million; staffing supports, &euro;201.6 million and quality initiatives, &euro;86.8 million. These amounts include an element of administration estimated at about 4%. Projects are selected on the basis of a range of criteria such as the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the <Col N="587"/>proposal; the capacity of the group to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination of the project within the local community; and costings and value for money.</P>
    <P>My Department has also asked Area Development Management Limited, which carries out the day-to-day administration of the equal opportunities programme on my behalf, to ensure that all capital projects, which have already received grant allocations will proceed. Many of these projects are either awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and draw down the funds. In the event that any of these projects do not proceed, the funding will be de-committed and made available to another suitable project.</P>
    <P>All counties have benefited from new projects and additional child care places under the programme. We now need to use the remaining capital funding to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline will be reviewed to ensure that those projects, which best meet the programme criteria and which can be completed by the end of the present programme, will receive priority. The ability to bring a project to fruition before the end of the present programme is an important criterion at this stage as I am aware that it can frequently take time to complete a project and there are constraints to ensure that we maximise our EU funding.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the EOCP and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if he intends to remove his threat to introduce alternative arrangements for the operation of Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan; his views on the fact that this facility is an integral part of the Prison Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have indicated many times in recent months, it is not my preferred course of action to introduce alternative arrangements for the operation of Loughan House. The Government decision on this matter makes it clear that this step will only take place if there is <Col N="590"/>no resolution to the ongoing negotiations taking place with the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. In effect, the future of Loughan House is linked to this process.</P>
    <P>If a change of status for Loughan House becomes necessary, the facility will continue in operation, albeit under different management. I have already indicated that, in the event of change, the intention is to transform this facility into a post release centre for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the Scariff area is policed by Scariff Garda station in the Killaloe district. The current personnel strength of Scariff Garda station is five across all ranks. The personnel strength of the Killaloe district is 36 across all ranks.</P>
    <P>Resources are augmented from within the district or division as required. Local Garda management is satisfied that the resources currently in place in the Scariff area are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in Scariff with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained,</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 758 and 759 together.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from being in the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. This restriction does not, however, apply on the <Col N="593"/>occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function. In this context &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is defined as any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and includes any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public. The restriction does not apply to other parts of the licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Where a part of licensed premises contains a bar counter which is physically closed and is not used for the supply of intoxicating liquor, such a part of the premises does not constitute a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; within the meaning of the 2003 Act. As I have previously stated, I would recommend that any person organising an alcohol-free event in such premises for persons under the age of 18 notify the superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the Garda district in which the premises are situated in advance of the proposed event.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that these four Land Commission Schedule applications refer to: schedule number 90102, which was lodged on 26 May 1988; schedule number 90103, which was lodged on 23 October 1987; schedule number 90104, which was lodged on 23 October 1987; and schedule number 91992, which was lodged on 25 June 1991.</P>
    <P>Land Commission schedule applications are deemed to be registered as of the date of vesting which is prior to the date of lodgement of the documents in the Land Registry. Accordingly, registration in the Land Registry of Land Commission cases is afforded a lower priority than the registration of other dealings.</P>
    <P>The Registrar of Titles has also provided me with the following information on the Land Commission schedule applications. Schedule numbers 90102 and 90103 are receiving attention in the Land Registry and, subject to no queries arising, will be completed within the next few weeks. A query issued regarding schedule number 90104, to the lands division, Department of Agriculture and Food, on 23 April 2004 and the application cannot proceed until this query has been satisfactorily resolved. On receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that there is no reference to the individual referred to by the Deputy or any other party with the same surname in the application the subject of schedule number 91922 and that this application is also receiving attention in the Land Registry.</P>

	<P>The optimum use of Garda stations was considered as part of a major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation. The review has looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The Garda SMI implementation steering group has now finalised its report and I am having the report examined in my Department and will give careful consideration to all of the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations, including any implications they may have for the opening hours of Garda stations.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State and made an asylum application in October 1999. His partner, along with her then three year old daughter, followed him to the State and made her asylum application in May 2000. Both asylum applications were refused. She gave birth in the State on 13 October 2001 and both persons applied for residency on the basis of parentage of the Irish born child.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>As the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered but only in the context of the already issued ministerial proposals to deport them. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Given the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the files will be examined.</P>

	<P>Under the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations 1996, it is the responsibility of landlords to register with the local authority and pay the appropriate fee. Information relating to registration of houses and landlords, based on returns from local authorities, is provided in the quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins published by my Department. The most recent information is contained in the September quarter 2003 bulletin, which indicated that an overall total of 23,863 units were registered with local authorities by 17,058 landlords on 30 September 2003.</P>
    <P>The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, which is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, provides that landlords must register details of their tenancies with a private residential tenancies board and provides, accordingly, for the repeal of the 1996 regulations. This board will proactively pursue compliance and unregistered accommodation will come to notice when tenants bring cases to it. Landlords must be registered in order to avail of the board&rsquo;s dispute resolution service, a double fee will apply to late registrations and penalties for convictions are being increased.</P>

	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s integrated and preventative strategies on homelessness, local authorities, together with <Col N="602"/>health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, were required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness in their areas. The Homeless Agency is charged with the implementation of the action plans drawn up by the four Dublin local authorities. I understand that a review of progress in implementing the main aims of the Dublin action plan was recently carried out on behalf of the agency and I have arranged for a copy of the action plans and review document be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in addressing the issue of homelessness in Dublin since the publication of the homeless strategies. The Government is committed to continuing its support of the efforts of the local statutory and voluntary agencies in tackling this issue. My Department&rsquo;s provision for the recoupment to local authorities of 90% of the cost of providing accommodation and related services for homeless persons in 2004 is &euro;51 million. This brings to &euro;190.6 million the total provided for this purpose since 2000. Further funding is provided by the local authorities and, in the case of care related services, by the health boards.</P>
    <P>A review of the implementation of the integrated and preventative homeless strategies and their associated local action plans will commence in the near future.</P>

    <P>A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation has been <Col N="603"/>provided.

    <P>The management of the Dublin Bay waste water treatment plant is the responsibility of Dublin City Council. On completion of the commissioning stage it will fully meet the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive.</P>
    <P>I understand from the council that the plant has been meeting the intermediate standards required under the contract for the commissioning stage and has already resulted in a very substantial improvement in water quality in Dublin Bay. While the quality of the discharged effluent was affected at certain times by commissioning difficulties, it was well within the contractual limits. The latest position is that, while the results of a two months continuous test of the plant are currently being analysed, all wastewater arriving at the plant, together with all sludge produced on site, is being subjected to the complete treatment process and only treated effluent is being discharged.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 779 and 780 together.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s national parks and wildlife service is responsible for the management of woodlands in State-owned natural heritage sites. In general, such woodlands contain large numbers of native tree species. Very little formal planting takes place at these sites, as natural regeneration is the preferred method of increasing the numbers of broad-leaved trees. However, at sites where exotic conifers are the dominant species, a programme of conifer clearance is ongoing and, when clear-felled, these areas are generally fenced off to allow for natural regeneration of native tree species.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2003, planting of broadleaved species took place as follows: Glengarriff Wood nature reserve, County Cork, 130.6 hectares of this wood has been clear-felled in the period under discussion and the area is being managed as a broadleaf plantation; 85 hectares of the clear-felled area has been planted with broadleaf, and the rest of the area is being left to natural re-generation of broadleaf species, a process which is progressing well: Wicklow Mountains national park, WMNP, approximately five hectares was planted at Derrybawn. Approximately six hectares of exotic species were clear-felled and replanted with native broadleaved species at Deputy&rsquo;s pass. Some 4.9 hectares of exotic species was clear-felled and replanted with broadleaved native species at St. Saviour&rsquo;s Wood. Approximately two hectares of mixed native broadleaf&rsquo;s and hedgerows was planted on areas around the WMNP offices at Kilafin, Laragh, County Wicklow. Other plantings include, some 0.5 hectares of oak species was planted in mitigation of trees cleared for the construction of the Glen of the Downs road scheme. Approximately ten hectares of exotic species was cleared from the Vale of Clara nature reserve, County Wicklow, and natural regeneration of native species is being allowed to take place here. Approximately 750 broadleaf trees have been planted at Wexford wildfowl reserve.</P>
    <P>The NPWS does not generally engage in the planting of non-native conifer trees, although small quantities of yew and Scots pine are planted from time to time. My Department does not have details of tree planting by local authorities.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have emphasised that there can be no excuse for illegal waste activities and that the effective operation of the regulatory regime for the waste sector is a key priority. To this end, I have introduced a number of significant initiatives designed to achieve more vigorous enforcement of the waste code.</P>
    <P>First, I took the opportunity of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 to provide new enforcement powers for the environmental authorities concerned and to increase the maximum fines that can be imposed for contraventions of the waste code. Second, I have recognised the need for improved structural arrangements to underpin the enforcement effort. I announced, last October, details of the establishment of a new Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, located within the Environmental Protection Agency. While it has a wide remit, the OEE, at my request, is focusing on waste-related enforcement activities as a priority.</P>
    <P>Third, I have allocated &euro;7 million from the environment fund to support the first year of a major five-year programme of local authority waste enforcement activities. The aim is to <Col N="606"/>provide a stronger and more visible local authority enforcement presence on the ground and to ensure more frequent inspections and speedier responses to reported instances of illegal dumping.</P>
    <P>On the matter of quarries, I signed an order on 15 April 2004 commencing section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 with effect from 28 April 2004. Section 261 introduces a once-off system of registration for all quarries except those for which planning permission was granted in the past five years. Under the registration system, quarry operators must supply full details of their operations to the planning authority, including on the area of the quarry, the material being extracted, the hours of operation, and the traffic noise and dust generated. Following registration a planning authority can impose conditions on the operation of a pre-1964 quarry or may require such a quarry to apply for planning permission in certain circumstances. Authorities will also be able to restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry which received planning permission more than five years ago. I have also published, in tandem with the commencement of this section, guidelines for planning authorities on quarries and ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter for individual public sector organisations, in the context of the awarding of contracts, to consider how compliance with the requirements of planning, waste management and other legislative codes, on the part of contractors, is to be secured.</P>

    <P>It is a matter for each returning officer to assign voting machines to polling stations having regard to the number of electors assigned to each station. The number of voting machines acquired by the returning officers in the three constituencies at the general election was 600 for the electorate of 231,734. The total number of voting machines acquired or being acquired by returning officers in preparation for the June 2004 elections is 7,315 for an electorate of 2,983,178. A breakdown per returning officer is set out in the following table. It is estimated that <Col N="615"/>between 5% and 10% of machines will be available as spare machines.</P>
    <P>The procedure for making a polling scheme is set out in Part IV of the Electoral Act 1992 and the Electoral (Polling Schemes) Regulations 1964.</P>

I intend to carefully consider any suggestions for clarifying or improving the guidelines before they are finalised; comments are to be submitted to my Department by 30 April.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the rural housing issue and the fact that there has already been extensive opportunity for public debate, and following earlier precedent, I have requested planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have regard to the guidelines with effect from the date of their publication. The guidelines are a material consideration in terms of development plans and in the consideration of planning applications. Planning authorities are required to review and vary their development plans, where necessary, to ensure that their policies on rural settlement are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The national climate change strategy review process incorporates an update of greenhouse gas emissions projections, together with a particular emphasis on cross-cutting economic instruments to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto target. These include, taxation and emissions trading and other flexible mechanisms which have been and are being developed at national/EU/international level since the national strategy was formulated.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Government is ensuring that Ireland is prepared to participate fully in the pilot phase of EU emissions trading scheme 2005-07. In this regard, on 31 March 2004 the Environmental Protection Agency submitted the national allocation plan, NAP, to the European Commission for approval prior to the issue of allowances to the participants in emissions trading. The installations included in emissions trading represent approximately one third of Irish greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>The study underpinning the development of the NAP identified the overall national distance to target in the Kyoto period 2008-2012 at 9.2 million tonnes CO2 equivalent, MtCO2e, per annum. Reductions below the base case scenario of 4.3 MtCO2e are implicit in the indicative allocation announced for the emissions trading sector for this period, leaving reductions of 4.9 MtCO2e to be achieved within the rest of the economy. I am satisfied that 1.2 MtCO2e can be achieved within the sector of the economy outside emissions trading at or below the expected market price of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2, and Government has given an indication of intent to purchase 3.7 million allowances on the international market for that part of the economy, with the possibility for the purchases to be funded from the CO2 tax to be explored in the consideration of this tax.</P>
    <P>I am now advancing the review of the overall national climate change strategy to take account of the foregoing decisions and progress in relation to emissions trading. I intend to publish the outcome in due course. I am satisfied that full implementation of the revised strategy over the remainder of the decade, in the context of the arrangements for emissions trading together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations will be fully met by the 2008-12 period.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 800, 801 and 833 together.</P>
    <P>On 12 November 2003, Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on the landslides in north Mayo on 19 September 2003 and its proposals for restoration and further protection work deemed to be required to return the area to normal living conditions. These proposals comprised: (1) Repairs to Infrastructure, including roads, bridges, culverts and water mains and restoration of the graveyards: the estimated cost of these work, which includes a provision for increasing the capacity of culverts as recommended in the report, is &euro;2,835,500; (2) further protection works required to manage the risk and allow the redesignation of areas currently graded as high to either low or medium risk. Total estimated cost is &euro;2,224,664 which includes &euro;1,539,075 as the estimated cost of constructing specialised kinetic barriers; and, (3) humanitarian aid-assistance for private property damage.</P>
    <P>As regards (1) above, the council&rsquo;s estimated cost of repairing public roads and bridges in north Mayo as a result of the landslide was &euro;2,030,500. A grant of &euro;571,000 was paid by my Department to the council in 2003 for immediate remedial <Col N="619"/>works and I have allocated a further special grant of &euro;1,459,500 for the improvement, repair and protection of roads and bridges in the area affected by the landslide to the council in 2004. My Department understands from the council that the cost of works carried out to date under these allocations is &euro;811,175. An extract from an inventory of infrastructural rehabilitation works required, which was part of the report on the landslide submitted on 12 November 2003, is set out in the table below.</P>
    <P>The report also advised that Mayo County Council had incurred expenditure of &euro;25,000 in carrying out repairs to some water supply schemes. This expenditure was taken into account in my Department&rsquo;s 2004 rural water programme block grant allocation of &euro;8 million to the council, an increase of more than 63% on the 2003 outturn sum of &euro;4.9 million. I understand that a contribution towards the restoration in the graveyard area will be provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
    <P>As regards (2) above, the local government fund general purpose grant to Mayo County <Col N="620"/>Council for 2004 amounted to &euro;29,752,341. This represents an increase of 17.5% over the corresponding grant for 2003 which, having regard to present constraints on public expenditure, reflects a demonstrable concern to address the current special requirements of Mayo County Council, including in particular the landslide in the north Mayo area.

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The current local authority mortgage interest rates are 2.95% variable and 4.45% for a five year fixed, which represent competitive rates of lending. Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of the long-term funds involved.</P>
    <P>Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages have been permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more, applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages.</P>
    <P>The position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in November 2001, in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The establishment of a separate national waste management board has been deferred, as I consider that current requirements will be better served by direct political leadership of the process of implementing nationwide all regional and local waste management plans. I have made clear, since assuming office as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my determination to provide this leadership in a clear and proactive way.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the other commitments contained in my Department&rsquo;s policy document delivering change published in March 2002, is as follows: first, the proposed national waste prevention programme aimed at delivering substantial results on waste prevention and minimisation across all waste streams was launched earlier this month. The programme is being led by a core prevention team within the EPA in consultation with other stakeholders. Funding of &euro;2 million from the environment fund is being provided for the programme in 2004. Second, a market development group, aimed at the development of new applications and markets for reclaimed recyclable material was launched earlier this month. The work of this group will be of crucial importance in the development of a sustainable recycling sector and if the overall recycling effort is to be successful. Enterprise Ireland is providing the necessary administrative supports and I have allocated an initial &euro;1 million from the environment fund to support the group&rsquo;s activities. Third, it is intended to establish the proposed recycling consultative forum later this year to act as a consultative and advisory body on all aspects of recycling and also to identify actions not yet being undertaken that have the potential to further stimulate and encourage recycling. Fourth, an enhanced producer responsibility function has been established within the EPA and will complement the work of the core prevention team.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of producer responsibility initiatives will be intensified under the new office of environmental enforcement. Under the enhanced brief the EPA will be responsible for the identification of suitable waste streams-materials for future producer responsibility initiatives. Fifth, a draft national strategy for biodegradable waste setting out a range of integrated measures aimed at significantly increasing the recycling of biodegradable municipal waste has also been published and is now the subject of public consultation. Sixth, in relation to the development of a public service waste management programme, my Department has already issued a green Government guide to other Departments. It is intended that a broader public sector waste management programme will be developed as a priority in the next phase of waste awareness and communications activities to be initiated after the current phase of the race <Col N="623"/>against waste campaign concludes in the summer of 2004.</P>

     <Quest>if planners of Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will adhere to 3.3.1, page 11, of the residential density guidelines for planning authorities published by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3.3.1. of the guidelines for planning authorities on residential density deals with the subject of infill residential development. The guidelines indicate that in residential areas whose character is established by their density or architectural form a balance has to be struck between the reasonable protection of the amenities and privacy of adjoining dwellings, the protection of established character and the need to provide residential infill.</P>
    <P>The guidelines state that the design approach in such cases should be based on a recognition of the need to protect the amenities of directly adjoining neighbours and the general character of the area and its amenities, i.e. views, architectural quality, civic design, etc. However, subject to reasonable conformity with these, developments on infill sites, particularly those in excess of 0.5 hectares, 1.2 acres, should be capable of proposing their own density and character.</P>
    <P>The guidelines in question were issued in September 1999 in accordance with section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. All planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the provisions of such section 28 guidelines in exercising their planning functions.</P>

	<P>The principal statutes governing cruelty to animals are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for that legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In so far as dog controls are concerned, my Department is currently engaged in discussions with relevant interests regarding the proper management of kennels in regard to the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992. These discussions are continuing and are intended to inform my Department whether, or to what extent, revised legislation or regulatory or administrative measures are desirable in this area.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it should be noted that the main focus of the Control of Dogs Acts is not animal welfare but the control of stray dogs and dangerous dogs, such as guard dogs, which could present nuisance or danger to the general public or to other animals. As regards deer hunting, under section 29(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, my Department issues licences to hunt deer during an open season. My Department also issues an annual licence to the Ward Union Hunt Club, under section 26(1)(ii) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, to hunt deer with a pack of stag hounds, subject to various conditions. In 1999 the Ward Union Hunt Club developed and adopted a code of conduct for their hunt to address welfare concerns.</P>
    <P>The Ward Union Hunt Club is monitored by conservation rangers from my Department and a veterinary inspector from the Department of Agriculture and Food. Prior to the issue of the annual licence written reports from supervisory staff are examined to establish that the club has complied with the hunting code of practice and that the hunt is conducted in accordance with the conditions of the licence. My Department has no function in relation to fur farming.</P>

This was adopted to achieve closure of the scheme, to allow re-prioritisation of this budget provision to other social and affordable housing programmes and to prevent speculative applications on houses that might not be built for years to come. In the circumstances it is not possible to extend the closing date and no exception can be made for applicants who did not comply with the deadline.</P><Col N="628"/>

	<P>Section 81 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the local improvements scheme and my Department&rsquo;s local improvements scheme memorandum, which issued in February 2002, sets out the current terms and conditions for the payment of local improvements scheme grants. Under the scheme grants are provided to county councils for the construction and improvement of non-public roads which provide access to parcels of land of which at least two are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate agricultural activities, or provide access for harvesting purposes for two or more persons, or which will in the opinion of the county council be used by the public.</P>
    <P>The memorandum also stated that regard should be had to the need to consider special circumstances in some cases, such as hardship or elderly or disabled occupants. My Department&rsquo;s circular letter RW 10/2003 of 4 March 2003 reminded county councils that when assessing applications, discretion could be exercised in cases where special circumstances involving hardship, or elderly or disabled occupants exist.</P>
    <P>The administration of the scheme is a matter for the relevant county council. Each county council has responsibility for decisions regarding eligibility and subsequent selection and prioritisation of schemes, subject to the terms of the Department&rsquo;s memorandum and circulars.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As the provision of fire cover is statutory duty of the local fire authority, in this <Col N="630"/>instance Mayo County Council, my Department has been in correspondence with Mayo County Council regarding the concerns raised by Clare Island Community Co-op Limited and a reply has now issued to the Co-op. I understand that Mayo County Council, in partnership with the community on Clare Island, implemented a community fire prevention, protection and intervention scheme with appropriate training to householders in recent years and that the council is again examining its arrangements on Clare Island in the light of community concerns.</P>
    <P>The community fire protection scheme implemented on Clare Island by the council is in line with fire safety strategy adopted by other coastal fire authorities for offshore islands, in consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>The scheme was recently assisted with funding from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who provided 50% of the cost of supplying and installing fire protection equipment on such islands with the local fire authorities making up the balance. My Department supports the local authority fire service through capital funding towards the provision of priority fire stations, fire appliances and equipment etc. In the period 1998-2004, Mayo County Council received approval to purchase seven new fire appliances at a total cost of about &euro;1.7 million and these appliances are being grant-aided in full by my Department.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy, this capital funding is targeted at projects and proposals in significant population centres. In keeping with the emerging concept of community fire safety, my Department does not envisage supporting the development of fire brigades in smaller isolated communities as practical or feasible. Rather the approach is to encourage and develop the type of community-based initiatives already undertaken by the fire authorities to protect people living on offshore islands.</P>

Copies of both documents are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    <P>As part of this review, the priorities for use of the moneys available in the environment fund were re-examined and, in that context, the proposed scheme of grants under the waste management infrastructural grants scheme in <Col N="631"/>relation to private sector applicants was re-considered. Having regard to the significant levels of investment and growth in scale of the private waste industry in recent times, the process of waste industry consolidation which is in evidence and which is likely to continue and, the competing priorities for the resources available in the environment fund, I have decided not to proceed with the scheme of grants mentioned above. Instead I intend to divert the funding to a number of other areas including increased waste enforcement activities, which are crucial to providing the confidence that current and future investment in the legitimate waste sector will not be undermined by illegal activities competing against fully compliant operators. Letters have issued to all private sector applicants on 7 April last informing them of my decision.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging that satisfies the provisions of the directive. In other words, that which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in Annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the excessive packaging of goods. It is generated through a combination of poor packaging design, inefficient production or manufacturing processes and unsustainable consumption patterns such as purchasing excessively packaged products. Taking action to prevent waste being generated is fundamental to the overriding objective of decoupling economic growth from growth in waste. Ireland is particularly disadvantaged in the prevention and minimisation of packaging because approximately 75% of the packaging placed on the market here is imported in association with imported goods.</P>
    <P>The principle of producer responsibility requires waste producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products that they have placed on the market at end-of-life. This approach is supported by the producer responsibility initiative for packaging waste that operates here. It is underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 that replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997. Under the regulations, producers are required to take steps to recover packaging waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.</P>
    <P>Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste. This was done with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. It is the only approved compliance scheme. The company&rsquo;s primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste rather than packaging minimisation. A fees structure applies to its members and is based on the type and amount of packaging placed on the market. It reflects the polluter pays principle and directly promotes the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month I launched an ambitious national waste prevention programme. It aims to <Col N="633"/>deliver significant improvements in waste prevention and minimisation across all waste streams, including packaging. A core prevention team within the EPA will lead the programme. It must develop the programme in consultation with other stakeholders. The environment fund will provide &euro;2 million in 2004.</P>
    <P>In March 2002 the successful environmental levy on plastic bags was introduced. It resulted in a reduction in the dispensing of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets by over 90%. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to consider its extension to other materials that may be problematic from a waste management or litter perspective. In July 2003 a report was issued by the litter monitoring body, that is co-ordinated by my Department. It provided valuable statistical data on litter pollution in Ireland. Fast food take-away bags and wrappers were identified as the largest litter component in the packaging litter category. Chewing gum and automated teller machine receipts were also identified as problematic. As a result, I announced my intention to take measures to tackle litter caused by such items. In September 2003 I commissioned a consultancy study to analyse and recommend appropriate economic instruments, including environmental levies and negotiated agreements with the relevant sectors, that might be implemented. Recently a report was presented to me and I am considering it at present.</P>

	<P>The UK housing market is not analogous to ours. However, my Department monitors trends in the UK that are of relevance to here.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that supply is the key to addressing pressures on the housing market. Its focus has been on maintaining a high level of supply to meet a strong demand and thus moderate the rate of increase in house prices. Clear evidence proves that the strategy is effective. Last year was the ninth successive year of record housing output with over 68,800 house completions, an increase of almost 20% on 2002. In Ireland houses are built faster than anywhere else in Europe with 17 houses per 1,000 population. This compares to the rate in the UK where around three houses are built per 1,000 population.</P>
    <P>The rate of house price increases is still problematic. However, it has moderated considerably since the late 1990s when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, predicts a greater balance in the housing market over the next few years as increased supply has a restraining effect on house prices.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing. It will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies, as necessary.</P>

	<P>At present the Residential Tenancies Bill is before the D&aacute;il. It imposes an obligation on tenants not to engage in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, dwellings to which the Bill applies. It allows landlords to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such <Col N="635"/>behaviour with a notice period of only seven days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious, but persistent, behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes an obligation on landlords to enforce the obligations applying to tenants where a person, such as a neighbour, would be adversely affected by a failure to enforce the tenant obligations. It provides for the establishment of the private residential tenancies board on a statutory basis. One of its main functions will be to take over the role of the courts in dealing with disputes that arise in the private rented sector. The Bill gives third parties that are affected by anti-social behaviour a right to take a case to the board against a landlord who has failed to enforce the tenancy obligations of the tenant regarding anti-social behaviour. If the board upholds a complaint referred by a third party the landlord will be directed to ensure that the tenants comply with their obligations. It can, if necessary, enforce compliance through the courts.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I launched the report, bulletin No. 2 of the 2002-03 all-Ireland drug prevalence survey, last week. The surveywas undertaken jointly by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, Ireland and the Drug and Alcohol Information <Col N="637"/>and Research Unit, Northern Ireland, and nearly 8,500 people were interviewed.</P>
    <P>The survey looked at the overall national problem. Last October initial results were published and they showed that the vast majority of the general population have never used any illegal drug. Less than one in five or 19% reported ever taking an illegal drug.</P>
    <P>The second bulletin gives a breakdown of data by health board area. The key findings are as follows: the proportion of those surveyed who reported ever having taken an illegal drug, lifetime prevalence, varied between 11% and 29% across health board areas; the lowest rate of recent illegal drug use, this means people who used an illegal substance in the previous year, was recorded in the North Western Health Board at 3% and the highest rate was recorded in the Northern Area Health Board at 8%; prevalence rates of current drug use, this means used a drug in the previous month, varied between 0.5% in the North Western Health Board area and 5% in the Northern Area Health Board area; prevalence rates, including lifetime, recent and current usage, tended to be higher in the eastern area; cannabis was the main illegal drug used on a lifetime, recent or current basis in all health board areas; prevalence rates for cannabis were at least twice as high for other illegal drugs; and prevalence rates for other illegal drugs were considerably lower than for cannabis across all areas and periods; the highest prevalence rate for recent use of ecstasy was 3% and for cocaine powder 2% compared to 8% for cannabis; the profile of illegal drug users showed a great deal of consistency across health boards; in almost all areas prevalence rates of lifetime, recent and current use were higher amongst men than women and higher amongst young people than older people; prevalence rates for sedatives, tranquillisers and anti-depressants were higher amongst older people and women in most areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the bulletin confirms that the vast majority of people here in all regions have never used illegal drugs, even if there are significant regional variations. I am conscious that the results highlight the fact that drug use is not confined to major cities but is now an issue for urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is not complacent about this finding and remains determined to tackle drug misuse on a number of fronts. The local drugs task forces, the young peoples facilities and services fund and the regional drugs task forces try to combat the drug problem. Through their valuable work and the ongoing implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 much is being done and will continue to be done over the coming years to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the work of the LDTFs. All of the task forces &mdash; with the exception of Bray &mdash; are currently implementing their second round of action plans. In total the <Col N="638"/>Government has allocated or spent approximately &euro;65 million to implement a range of projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997. Over &euro;11.6 million was allocated to 37 capital projects under the premises initiative. It was designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of whom are in LDTF areas.</P>
    <P>Approximately &euro;72 million was allocated to support over 450 facility and services projects in LDTF areas and the four other urban centres under the YPFSF. This includes over &euro;13 million that I recently allocated under round II of the fund to support over 100 services and facility projects targeting young people at risk of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Regional drugs task forces were also established throughout the country. At present they are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas &mdash; as well as the range and level of existing services &mdash; with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. This work will then feed into the drafting of regional action plans that will be assessed by the national drugs strategy team. Early next year I expect to make funding recommendations at the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. This will allow the RDTFs to implement their plans by mid-2005.</P>
    <P>The publication of the information contained in the bulletin is timely as the mid-term review of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 will commence shortly. Its valuable information will significantly add to our knowledge and understanding of drug use and is essential in developing appropriate policies for the future.</P>

	<P>The Sherkin Island Development Society received funding under the community development programme since 1997.

    <P>My Department has been concerned for some time that SIDS has not been achieving the primary aim of the programme, that is the empowerment of the local community to address, in a participative manner, the issues it deems important.

The project management were informed that funding would be withdrawn with effect from the end of March 2004.</P>
    <P>The project was also informed that it was my intention to examine the future development needs of the Sherkin community.

In the light of further consideration of the various issues involved, I have decided to offer SIDS funding on an interim basis for a period of six months, subject to acceptance by SIDS management of a number of conditions on restructuring of the project and operational and decision-making procedures. Should this offer of conditional further support be accepted by SIDS management, my Department will monitor progress and review the position at the end of the six month period.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 850 and 851 together.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs are set out in the Community Affairs (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2002 (SI 327 of 2002). Certain functions on anti-poverty networks and volunteering were <Col N="642"/>transferred from the Combat Poverty Agency and from Comhairle with effect from 1 January.</P>
    <P el="0">The principal developments since the establishment of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are as follows:</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4-?><i>Charities</i></P>
    <P LI="2" el="0">A consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities was announced in December 2003. It proposes, at section 9, to replace in its entirety existing charities legislation. The paper is the subject of a public consultation and has a deadline of 28 May 2004 for receipt of submissions. It can be accessed on the Charities Regulation web page at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
    <P LI="2"><i>Dormant Accounts</i></P>
    <P LI="2" el="0">The Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act extends the scheme established under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 to unclaimed life assurance policies. It was passed in February 2003. The commencement order (SI 92 of 2003) was signed on 6 March 2003. In September 2003 the disbursement plan of the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board for up to &euro;30 million was approved. In December 2003, the Government decided on new arrangements for the fund&rsquo;s disbursements. My Department is preparing draft legislation to give effect to the decision.</P>
    <P LI="2"><i>White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity</i></P>
    <P LI="2" el="0">New funding schemes to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies and for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector were introduced in 2003. They will channel funding of some &euro;5.5 million and &euro;1.9 million, respectively, to 56 community and voluntary organisations over the period 2003-2006. From 1 January 2004 my Department assumed responsibility for the programme for support for national anti-poverty networks from the Combat Poverty Agency and &euro;1.43 million will be expended under the programme in 2004. The White Paper Implementation and Advisory Group continued to meet on a regular basis. Substantive matters considered included the multiplicity of funding sources for the sector, voluntary activity units, accreditation of training, volunteering, and best practice standards in the voluntary and statutory sectors. A review of the IAG&rsquo;s three year remit is under way.</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4-?><i> Volunteering</i></P>
    <P LI="2" el="0">Responsibility for operational grants to support volunteering for three volunteeringorganisations transferred from Comhairle to my Department on 1 January 2004. A sum of &euro;0.27 million will be provided to the organisations in 2004.</P><Col N="643"/>

    <?oasys _ah?><P LI="2" el="0">Fifteen new projects were approved under the community development programme in 2003. It is hoped, subject to resources, to further expand the programme by bringing onstream further projects later this year. My Department is restructuring the programme&rsquo;s support service. My Department also continued to provide once-off grants to locally based voluntary and community groups. The 2004 scheme, for which &euro;2.7 million is available in 2004, will be advertised nationally on 29 May. The scheme of community support for older people is under review. I intend to advertise details of the 2004 scheme in the coming months. An allocation of &euro;2.4 million has been made for the scheme in 2004.</P><?oasys _xh?>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 854 and 856 together.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are
 in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.</P>
    <P>I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who wish to participate in the scheme. My Department pays transport providers to operate the scheme. However, it cannot provide transport services where none exist.</P>
    <P>At present access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed through the rural transport initiative. Area Development Management operates it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. In 2003 my Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the initiative and I have secured the same amount for 2004. Thereby ensuring that free travel pass holders will continue to have full access to community based transport services.</P>
    <P>In recent budgets the free schemes were significantly improved, including the free travel scheme, in terms of the qualifying conditions and their coverage. I will continue to review them with a view to identifying scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 855, 874, 875, 879 and 890 together.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to my comprehensive reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 604, 605, 618, 623, 632 and 636 on 23 March. The cost of the telephone allowance scheme in 2004 is estimated at &euro;92.2 million for 300,000 customers. It represents a significant increase of nearly &euro;9 million or 11% in expenditure over the 2003 cost.</P>
    <P>The telephone allowance appears on a customer&rsquo;s bi-monthly bill as a cash credit of &euro;40.82 and is not attributable to any particular component of the bill. Eircom invoices the Department for the same amount. The allowance is worth &euro;49.39 per bill, including VAT. The newly structured telephone allowance has applied since October 2003.</P>
    <P>Eircom increased its rental charges with effect from 4 February 2004. As a result, social welfare clients incur a small increased cost. It amounts to 94 cent per bi-monthly bill, including VAT, compared to an increased charge for non-social welfare customers of &euro;3.78 per bill. Eircom also offered to give low use customers up to &euro;10 worth of calls free per bi-monthly bill by promoting its separate vulnerable users scheme. It should further benefit social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>At present I have no plans to increase the telephone allowance. A change would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and other priorities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 859 and 869 together.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements free travel pass holders in Northern Ireland and the Republic can undertake free travel within their own jurisdictions. They can also avail of free cross-Border journeys on bus and rail services. The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a system of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners and other eligible social welfare customer categories. This would enable pass holders to make onward journeys free of charge in each jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>My Department is co-operating with the Rail Procurement Agency towards the introduction of an integrated public transport ticketing system in <Col N="647"/>the greater Dublin area, for free travel pass holders as well as for the general public. When it becomes operational in 2005 or 2006 it will involve the use of smartcard technology.</P>
    <P>When my Department is developing the scheme it will discuss the feasibility of using smartcard reader technology with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and other participating transport operators. Translink services in the North already operate such a system. Smartcard technology would have a number of advantages from an administrative and accounting perspective.</P>
    <P>Last year my Department&rsquo;s officials met representatives of the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland. A number of issues on the existing system of free travel on cross-Border routes was discussed. The northern representatives were advised of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce the scheme. Its design, implementation and ongoing management will require the active co-operation of that Department and the various travel operators in both jurisdictions. My Department will make further contact with the northern authorities when work on the introduction of the scheme begins.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years the Government introduced a number of measures designed to make qualification for old age pensions easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records. In 1997 the average yearly number of <Col N="648"/>contributions required for a minimum pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten.</P>
    <P><i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available for people with insurance contributions at different rates or from other EU countries or countries with whom Ireland has signed a bilateral agreement. Special pensions were introduced for those with pre-53 contributions and for the self-employed who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory insurance was introduced for that group.</P>
    <P>Measures are also in place since 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme allows for up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons men and women have gaps in their social insurance records. These can include time spent living abroad, working in the home and periods spent working in employment that may not have been insurable for pensions purposes. At present 56% of women and 44% of men are in receipt of a reduced rate of old age contributory and retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in recent years are designed to ensure that adequate recognition is given to all contributions while at the same time ensuring that payments are only made to those who have had a reasonable attachment to the social insurance fund throughout their working career. I am satisfied that the pensions received by those on reduced rate or <i>pro rata</i> pensions represent good value when compared to the level of contributions required for a full rate payment. At present there are no plans for one standard rate pension.</P>

	<P>People on community employment schemes may retain a portion of their rent supplement for up to four years subject to a gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 per week. The supplement may be retained at 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four.</P>
    <P>A participant in community employment may opt to be assessed in accordance with that tapered withdrawal system or standard supplementary welfare allowance rules. The will be entitled to whichever option is more beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has advised that following her commencement on the community employment scheme the level of the person&rsquo;s household income exceeded the &euro;317.43 limit applicable to the tapered withdrawal system. Her rent supplement was calculated in accordance with standard supplementary welfare allowance rules. Rent supplements are subject to a means <Col N="649"/>test. They are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after rent is paid, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, that recipients are required to pay from their resources.</P>
    <P>In addition, recipients are also required to contribute, towards their rent, any additional assessable means over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate. Up to &euro;50 per week of income from part-time employment may be disregarded in this means test.</P>
    <P>Under standard rules the amount of rent supplement payable in this case was calculated at &euro;11.50 per week. She appealed the decision. In the course of the appeal it came to light that in addition to her one-parent family payment and community employment wages she was also in receipt of previously undeclared maintenance payments of &euro;50 per week.</P>
    <P>When the amount of rent supplement payable is reviewed to take account of the maintenance payments the person concerned is deemed to have sufficient means to cater for her rent costs. Therefore, there will be no further entitlement to a rent supplement.</P>
    <P>As an exceptional measure the appeals officer decided that a payment of rent supplement at &euro;11.50 per week should continue until 1 May.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of 2,000 premature deaths associated with fuel poverty was mentioned in a report entitled Fuel Poverty and Policy in Ireland and the European Union. The policy institute at Trinity College Dublin and the Combat Poverty Agency published the report in 2003. The aim of the research was to analyse key policy issues on fuel poverty in Ireland and across the EU. The data for the period 1994 to 1997 was used.</P>
    <P>The number of people who die in winter in western countries is higher than those who do so at any other time of year. Much of the difference is attributed to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The report does not show that 2,000 people die here each year because they cannot afford to adequately heat their homes during the winter months. The claim of inability to afford adequate heat in the home was the category that attracted the lowest percentage of responsibility for fuel poverty in the course of the study. However, I recognise how important it is to ensure that people on low incomes have adequate fuel and it is an aspect that can counter fuel poverty.</P>
    <P>My Department keeps the extent to which people on social welfare can afford fuel under <Col N="650"/>review. Provision is made to ensure that the combined value of weekly social welfare payments and fuel allowances rises in real terms, after compensating people for inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>Increasing a primary payment for a full year is more expensive than increasing the fuel allowance for part of the year. The latter is correct as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. That, coupled with programmes to improve the fuel efficiency of the housing stock, will bring about a reduction in poverty levels, including fuel poverty levels, that I am working to achieve.</P>

	<P>In recent years the Government introduced a number of measures to benefit widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>In 2000 the widowed parent grant was introduced to provide additional assistance to those with dependent children in the difficult time following a bereavement. At present the grant is valued at &euro;2,700 and is paid in addition to the normal payments after death.</P>
    <P>Increases in the rates of child benefit are also of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997 child benefit has been increased significantly. From the beginning of this month payments are &euro;131.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;165.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who are over 66 years of age, the Government had committed to bringing their rate of payment into line with that of the old age contributory pension. It was achieved through a series of special increases in recent budgets and the process was completed in budget 2004. The current maximum rate of old age contributory and widow or widowers pension is &euro;167.30 per week.</P>
    <P>A group of widows and widowers also benefits from the changes in the free schemes announced <Col N="652"/>over a number of budgets. Under these arrangements all persons aged over 70 years of age are entitled to a range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
    <P>The provisions for widows and widowers under the social welfare code will be kept under review and further improvements will be considered where appropriate.</P>
    <P>A respite care grant is paid to carers in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance and people who care for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance. It is not payable with other</P>
    <P>social welfare payments. The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for all other matters that relate to the provision and availability of respite care.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Income maintenance payments available under the social welfare code consist of a range of social insurance benefits. They are based on PRSI contributions and a further range of social assistance payments that are payable subject to a means test to people who are not qualified for insurance based payments. The purpose of the means tests is to ensure that, for those who do not have social insurance cover or who have insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for benefit, resources are targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>A person who is ill long-term or disabled can qualify for either long-term disability benefit or invalidity pension, if they have sufficient PRSI contributions. Where such a person has not worked or does not have sufficient PRSI contributions, they may qualify for disability allowance, which is means-tested.</P>
    <P>People who are ill long-term or disabled are treated under the social welfare code in the same way as people who experience other contingencies such as unemployment, old age and widowhood. The means test for the disability allowance scheme is not considered to be discriminatory.</P>
    <P>Since the take-over of the disability allowance scheme from the health boards in 1996 a range of improvements have been introduced in the means test for disability allowance purposes. These include: substantial increases in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment; self-employment that can be disregarded for means test purposes, currently &euro;120 a week; and major improvements in the method of assessing capital with the first &euro;12,697 being disregarded.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of these and other general improvements in the disability allowance, there has been a substantial increase in its take-up. The number of recipients has more than doubled, an <Col N="653"/>increase from 34,500 in October 1996 to 69,398 at the end of March 2004.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the disability allowance differs from other social welfare payments and involves people who are in full-time residential care. One of the conditions that applied to the disability allowance scheme formerly was that payment was not made to people in residential care or in a hospital. Since my Department took over the running of the scheme this disqualification was progressively relaxed. Many of those who had previously been disqualified because they were in residential care are now entitled to a payment.</P>
    <P>A working group was established to examine the takeover by my Department of the spending allowances paid to people with disabilities in residential care who were not entitled to disability allowance and for the standardisation of the level of these allowances. One of its functions will be to examine the best method for the transfer of responsibility for the payment of these allowances and of the funds involved.</P>

	<P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case. It advised that the amount of rent supplement was reviewed to take account of a recently born second child.</P>
    <P>The amount of supplement paid in respect of March 2004 was incorrectly calculated. The matter was rectified and a cheque for the revised amount plus arrears will issue this week.</P>
    <P>The revised amount takes account of the fact that the mother has not received the increase in her one-parent family payment due in respect of her second child. Therefore, a higher rent supplement is being paid. The payment of an additional amount will continue until she receives her full entitlement of one-parent family payment.</P>

	<P>Payment of pensions by electronic fund transfer is generally made every fortnight in arrears. Payment by payable order or book voucher is paid weekly in advance. The difference in the payment frequencies arises for technical reasons associated with EFT. The alignment of payment frequencies will be progressed as soon as the necessary work to resolve the technical issues can be carried out.</P>
    <P>Most people who opt for EFT do so when they make their initial claim so there is no interruption to the flow of payments once the claim is allowed. Where an existing recipient opts to switch from pension book to EFT the different payment cycle may result in a temporary interruption of payment. Each person, regardless of payment method, receives the same quantum of payments over the lifetime of his or her claim.</P>

	<P>Child benefit is paid monthly at the beginning of each month to all families irrespective of income. In the past it has been argued that moving to a more frequent payment would assist families on low income. A change to a more frequent payment, such as weekly or fortnightly, would lead to a payment later than is currently available.</P>
    <P>Since 2001 child benefit has been increased by &euro;77.64 for each of first two children and by &euro;94.19 in respect of the third and subsequent children. The measure helped low income families without affecting their incentive to take up paid employment.</P>
    <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service. It provides advice to individuals and families who have problems managing their finances, are in debt and who are on low income. The service does not provide financial assistance to its customers. It places an emphasis on practical personal budgeting measures that help people with debt problems. There are 52 offices all over the country and a person with debt problems should be referred to their local MABS office for advice.</P>
    <P>At present I have no plans to pay child benefit on a fortnightly basis. It would have major administrative and financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The national fuel scheme aims to assist householders in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and are unable to provide fully for their heating needs. A fuel allowance payment of &euro;9 per week is paid to eligible households. An additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The total amount paid is &euro;12.90 per week.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. Many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances.</P>
    <P>The duration of payment was increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks in April 2001. The means test was eased with effect from October of that year and the rate of fuel allowance was increased by 42% in January 2002.</P>
    <P>A change in the scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context. Significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income for people dependent on the social welfare system.

It is expected that the first round of applications will be invited in the near future and the assignment of new staff to my Department will follow in due course.</P>
    <P>At present the Office of Public Works is in the process of securing suitable accommodation for my Department in Drogheda. It is expected that information regarding options available will be provided shortly.</P>
    <P>A final date for the completion of moves will not be known until all accommodation and staff recruitment issues are concluded.</P>

	<P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case. It <Col N="659"/>advised that the amount of rent supplement was reviewed to take account of a recently born second child.</P>
    <P>The amount of supplement paid in respect of March 2004 was incorrectly calculated. The matter was rectified and a cheque for the revised amount, plus arrears in respect of March 2004, is due to issue this week.</P>
    <P>The revised rent supplement takes account of the fact that the mother has not received an increase in her one-parent family payment that she is due in respect of her second child. As a result a higher rent supplement is being paid. The additional rent supplement will continue until she receives her full entitlement of one-parent family payment.</P>
    <P>The board has advised that the level of rent supplement will be further reviewed when the increase is made in her one-parent family payment in respect of her second child. It will result in a reduction in the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
