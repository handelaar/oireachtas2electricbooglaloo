    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government stated that this Government would stand for a society in which people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes. Yesterday, Deputy Crawford uncovered evidence that the former Minister for Health and Children spent &euro;30 million on 145 reports. A sum of &euro;60 million was spent by the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on electronic voting and the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on how the cost of the roads programme has increased by &euro;8 billion over the period of the programme to date.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach understand the sense of frustration on the streets and in homes with petty crime, break-ins and assaults? What does he say to a shop owner in Talbot Street who last year apprehended 150 persons in the process of stealing goods in his premises, all of which went unreported because previous reports were not acted on? What does he say to a family I know in Sutton whose house was cleaned out a month ago? What does he say to an employee of this House whose house was robbed at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning? These are only some of the thousands of incidents of unreported crime.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach as head of Government is bound, under Article 40.3-5 of the Constitution, to ensure the law protects our citizens, their good name, their property and so forth. He has utterly failed to do that. Does he appreciate the level of concern among members of the public? The community has lost confidence in the Garda. The garda&iacute; are not given the resources they need to do their job. The Government has failed abysmally to use the resources of Government and the community to build a society that works and does not have the rash of anti-social behaviour breaking out all over the country every night and every weekend. People have a sense that nobody is in charge and that the abuse of property and people&rsquo;s rights is out of control.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that after eight years in office the Government has failed <Col N="1018"/>miserably to address that crisis of confidence? What will he do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe people have lost faith or trust in the garda&iacute;, that crime is out of control or that our legislation is outdated. This Government has continually recruited more garda&iacute; and given the Garda more resources. It has passed stronger laws and improved the criminal justice system, updating it whenever necessary. It is dealing with drug offenders, and the establishment of specialist Garda units to deal with various types of crime has worked effectively. That is the reason crime figures are down.</P>
      <P>Yes, it is true that there is still too much crime. Although the lobby in this House and elsewhere was in favour of increasing opening hours for drinking, I was one of the people who successfully opposed an extension of opening hours on Sunday nights. Some people wanted to extend the time to 2 a.m. We must be tougher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Zero tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to the garda&iacute;, and this is something that affects their morale, as soon as they use the type of actions and deterrents that are commonly used in other countries there is a group, which includes Members of this House, that will oppose them taking sterner action. We need to show a level of consistency.</P>
      <P>This Government reversed the cancellation of the prison building programme which took place during the 1990s. The rainbow Government failed to put one extra garda on the streets, failed to properly resource the garda&iacute;, failed to provide one extra prison place and supported a policy that led to 16% of sentenced prisoners being on the streets. We reversed those policies and we will continue to devote extra resources to the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have to take lectures from the Taoiseach on this. The Fine Gael Party founded this State and established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we will always support them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We will give the garda&iacute; the resources and the capacity to do their jobs, unlike a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with his zero tolerance concept which is now utterly out of control.</P>
      <P>Under Article 40.2 of the Constitution, the Taoiseach is charged with protecting the people of this country, their property and their good names. Does he not appreciate the level of frustration that builds up in people who, when they find that the garda&iacute; are not available or do not have the facilities to be available, take the law into their own hands with unfortunate and tragic consequences in some cases? The Government is responsible for this. The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, can smirk if he wishes but the Taoiseach and his Ministers do not appreciate the level of concern, frustration and anger with the failure of the Government to deal with anti-social behaviour, petty crime, burglaries and assaults. In his eighth year as Taoiseach, he and the Government have utterly failed. They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
      <P>Serious crime has increased seven fold, the number of personal assaults has doubled and at least two of every five crimes are not reported. What does the Taoiseach say to the shopkeepers and business owners whose premises are invaded daily yet nothing can be done by the garda&iacute; because they do not have the resources? There is a crisis of confidence among the public. The Taoiseach should be ashamed of how he has carried on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there is crime but the best way to deal with crime is to have more garda&iacute;, better resourced garda&iacute; and more equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We need 2,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is precisely what the Government is doing. This country, per 100,000 of population, has more garda&iacute; than most countries. We have more prison places, more laws and tough laws in many areas &mdash; laws that have been opposed by Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1020"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need new laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to drugs and sex crime, we have already substantially strengthened the criminal law through the criminal justice system. There are ten year mandatory jail sentences for anyone convicted of possessing drugs with a street value over a certain level &mdash; approximately &euro;13,000 &mdash; and three tough Bills have been enacted in regard to sex offences and child trafficking. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 has provisions which will strengthen the investigative powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by dealing with the power of arrest, search powers, detention powers and the power to take fingerprints and DNA samples. It is tough laws such as this which we must support and enact if we want to end thuggery on the streets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Rabbitte to speak without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask about the reported announcement by the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, that he intends to bring proposals to Cabinet by Christmas for a &euro;70 million spur Luas line from the green line at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to the red line at O&rsquo;Connell Street or Middle Abbey Street. Is this Government thinking? The Taoiseach should reflect on the decision of a previous Minister, the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who decided in 1997 that she was prepared to suffer the loss of &euro;114 million in EU funding at the time to commission a new report by WS Atkins, which, in April 1998, recommended precisely such an over-ground link. In May 1998, the then Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, rejected the Atkins proposition for a surface connection in favour of an underground link.</P>
      <P>If it was wrong in 1998, why is it right in 2004? Is there any coherence to Government policy in respect of the provision of transport in Dublin city? At that time, the then Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, justified her decision on the basis of the scale of disruption caused, the capacity of the streets in question, the objections of Dublin Bus and the prospect of a metro. The Taoiseach seems to have ruled out the prospect of a metro. What has changed since we heard the arguments from the Dublin city centre traders about the scale of disruption &mdash; we have had direct experience since then &mdash; and about the capacity of the streets to take a bus and Luas service, such as is the case on Dawson Street, Nassau Street, College Green and so on? Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the current Minister, Deputy Cullen, is talking off the top of his head, in keeping with <Col N="1021"/>the sound tradition in that Department in the last eight years, or whether this is Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The original Luas proposal for Dublin some six years ago was for a single Luas line from Tallaght via the city centre to Sandyford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal was originally for three lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question which does not concern the third line. The subsequent decision, as far back as 1998, was to separate the proposal into two elements: Sandyford to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and Tallaght to Connolly Station, with a link to the airport to follow later. There have been a number of developments since these decisions were taken. The Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change, which was published some years ago, proposes a metro for Dublin as well as the development of an integrated rail network in the city. Both of these elements come with a price tag running to billions of euro. The second issue is that the Railway Procurement Agency has submitted a detailed business plan to the Department of Transport in regard to the proposal for a metro link between the city centre and the airport. Third, Irish Rail has submitted to the Department of Transport proposals for an integrated rail network in the greater Dublin area, a plan that has much merit as I stated in the House last week. These proposals include the electrification of the Kildare and Maynooth lines and an interconnector tunnel linking Heuston Station to the docklands to enable greater integration of rail services at a far lower cost than the metro plan. The proposals from the RPA and more recently from Irish Rail would represent significant investments for the Exchequer and, as I stated last week, would take considerable time to deliver. However, that does not mean the process cannot begin.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, the Department of Transport is looking at the various proposals in the context of the overall needs of the greater Dublin area, in conjunction with the organisations to which I referred. It is hoped we will be able to give consideration to these proposals at an early date.</P>
      <P>The board of the RPA recently considered preliminary analysis of the feasibility and cost of &euro;70 million, as the Deputy stated, of linking the two Luas lines in the city centre. The indications are positive that joining the Luas lines does not rule out the case for either a metro or the rail lines, which was the case stated five or six years ago. It could be delivered in a period of 18 to 24 months from getting approval to proceed following a planning inquiry.</P>
      <P>This is the case stated by many of the relevant bodies in the context of the recent discussions of the Cabinet sub-committee. The priority is that <Col N="1022"/>we should do this. It will not affect any of the other decisions in regard to the strategy, A Platform for Change. The issue is being examined in this context on the understanding that the position of the relevant bodies is that if we are going to do it, we should make an early decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong but I take it from his reply that the metro is dead and that he favours the integrated proposal from Irish Rail. From his reply, I take it that what was rejected as a bad idea in 1998 is now deemed to be a good idea that does not cut off any options for the future. I also gather from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that cost is a major consideration in this regard. How does letting the years pass in the manner in which we have let them pass make the cost any more viable? The fact is that if it can now be done in 12 or 18 months, it could have been done at minimal extra cost contemporaneously with the works that have already been put in place. In the context of the overall cost of the Luas proposal at the time, a cost of &euro;70 million would not have been a significant add-on.</P>
      <P>My point is as follows. Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the announcement by the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that the Government would provide 850 additional beds in community nursing units through a PPP. This suggestion has been dropped and there is a complete reversal of direction. We seem to have the same lack of coherent, consistent thinking in the transport area. A proposal that was shot down out of hand by the former Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, is now considered the way to go. What way is this to make major infrastructure decisions for a city that is cluttered, log-jammed and gridlocked in terms of traffic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded. He should give way to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach allay fears in regard to how one can run, for example, a bus service in the inner city spatial area as well as having tram lines and motorists on the roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered yesterday on the issue of beds by stating that instead of building a new unit over a long period, which might still happen, we would begin using the private nursing beds already in place. It made sense to do this rather than dragging the process out for a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That was to be additional. Some 250 beds were offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of Luas, I do not think Deputy Rabbitte was leader of the Labour Party at the time-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>He was in another party.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1023"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I well recall the Labour Party protesting when the former Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, and I launched Luas and stated we would have Luas on the streets of Dublin by 2004. That has now been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If one travels around the city, one will see Luas. If one does not, that is not my problem. Luas is on the streets, working very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach wants history to be rewritten day by day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>While some Members may think that Luas was built with no cost, the two completed elements of it cost &euro;650 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago it was believed that the link would rule out other issues. A new plan which is good has been submitted by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. It is not a question of just dropping the concept of delivering a metro but doing it within a realistic cost. Dublin city cannot take up the entire transport infrastructure budget for Ireland. We must look at the best, most efficient and effective ways of delivering good transport services. The Government is doing this through roads, rail, the electrification of the Maynooth line and examining the linking of the two Luas lines. Those are our priority issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems certain the world will face four more years of President George W. Bush in the White House, a man who lives in continual denial of the need to address climate change. While I wish him well, I hope he has a chance to read <i>Earth in the Balance</i> by Al Gore for old times&rsquo; sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>

	<P>I am sure Bush is worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government also needs to take stock and prepare for the greater impact of climate change than might otherwise be the case. I appreciate the Government has had difficulty coming to terms with climate change. A half degree centigrade rise in the 20th century does not seem much. However, climate warming has doubled since the 1970s and since 1990 we had eight of the warmest years on record. Research by the University of East Anglia on rainfall shows that in 1960, 7% of rain was categorised as heavy while in the 1990s it rose to 15%. It is no surprise then that the Taoiseach has been faced with an interest in flooding as reflected in matters raised under Standing Order 31.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach claims he is committed &mdash; the word must be used advisedly &mdash; to a national climate change strategy and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, spoke about being committed to a strategic flood management policy. What does that commitment really mean? Will the Taoiseach accept responsibility considering Fianna F&aacute;il councillors were actively involved in building on flood plains in Clonmel, Lucan, Dunboyne and many other areas where people are purchasing houses? If he can admit to that, it will indicate he has a job to make up for those mistakes made in the name of his party. We are hearing about humanitarian aid for the flood victims. However, will a capital investment programme for flood prevention be introduced? We are not talking about humanitarian aid. We are talking about Cork city seeking funds for the last 20 years for quay walls and Dublin City Council seeking &euro;150 million for coastal defences. Will this be announced in the budget or before then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no comment to make on the US election. I am sure we will hear the result in due course. Having ratified the Kyoto Protocol, an ambitious national climate change strategy has been put in place. Arrangements administered by the EPA for large industry and power generation installations in the country to participate in carbon trading under the emissions trading scheme, which starts in two months, have also been put in place. The review of Ireland&rsquo;s national sustainable development strategy for the earth summit in Johannesburg last year has been finalised and published. We have enacted strong environmental legislation, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Act that improved EPA licensing and introduced more stringent enforcement powers and anti-litter measures. The Government has continued to transpose into domestic law other legislative measures from the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A complete review has been undertaken of the national climate change strategy to ensure sufficient measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are in place in line with our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. We have finalised the scheme to purchase emissions allowances as a supplementary measure to emissions reduction and trading to ensure compliance with our overall strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Sargent and I hope whoever is in the White House will now take a more enlightened position than four years ago when Kyoto was rejected and the US refused to work with other states. The outgoing US Administration began to examine the Kyoto Protocol in the last year and it was discussed at the G8 summit. Whether it is President Bush or Mr. Kerry, I hope the incumbent will take a more enlightened position. There is considerable pressure on the US to do so.</P>
      <P>Water plains were covered in the last major planning Act. Many of the projects referred to by the Deputy have either commenced or are being examined. Some are being held up for various reasons, with which the Deputy will be familiar. Investment has been made in drainage, sewerage and other schemes to ensure we can deal with the flood issue in a more efficient way. Regarding building on plains, since the population has risen by 1 million since 1973 that extra million people must live somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the transcript of the proceedings of the inquest into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, and on the recom<Col N="1029"/>mendation of the inquest jury, I forwarded a copy of the transcript to the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy.</P>
        <P>Following its consideration of the final report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the report of the independent commission of inquiry into the bombings last July, the Government decided to establish a commission of investigation with appropriate terms of reference in line with the sub-committee&rsquo;s recommendations, to examine the Garda investigation of the bombings and missing documents and to pursue with the British Government the establishment of a Weston Park style inquiry into the bombings.</P>
        <P>Following the passing of the relevant legislation last July, my Department has begun the process for the establishment of the commission of investigation which will require the approval of the House. While detailed terms of reference have yet to be approved by the Government, the commission will, as recommended by the Joint Oireachtas committee, consider why the Garda investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was wound down in 1974; why the Garda did not follow up on certain specific leads; and the exact documentation, departmental, Garda intelligence and any other documentation of relevance, that is unaccounted for.</P>
        <P>The commission will take account of investigative work already undertaken into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, including the report of the independent commission of inquiry, the final report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, inquest statements and the internal Garda investigation.</P>
        <P>I have already raised the establishment of a Weston Park style inquiry into the bombings at my meeting with Prime Minister Blair at Sedgefield. The Government will consider Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report into the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 very shortly. Mr. Justice Barron also reported on a number of other bombings and murders in appendices to this report, including bombings in Belturbet, Clones and Pettigo.</P>
        <P>I received the report into the murder of Seamus Ludlow from Mr. Justice Barron on 20 October. While his report is receiving the necessary consideration by relevant Departments and the Attorney General, it is clear that in his comprehensive report he has given thorough and meticulous consideration to all aspects of the terms of reference given to the inquiry.</P>
        <P>It would be the intention to refer both reports to the Joint Oireachtas committee with a view to their publication and consideration in public session, in a process similar to that which was put in place for consideration of the independent commission&rsquo;s report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974. I again thank Mr. Justice Barron and his team for their work in preparing these reports and for their commitment and dedication to this difficult task.</P><Col N="1030"/>
        <P>Mr. Justice Barron expects to conclude his report into the Dundalk bombing and a number of other bombings that took place after 1974, including the Castleblaney bombing, by the end of this year. To date, the cost of the Barron inquiry, including all legal expenses arising, is &euro;2.9 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I correct in saying this is the first time we have heard the Barron II report, in respect of the Seamus Ludlow case, has been received by Government? Will the Taoiseach indicate when he will refer it to the Oireachtas committee? I presume this will be done on the same basis as the previous report.</P>
        <P>When will the decision process on the establishment of the commission of investigation into the Garda investigation come before the House? Will it be put by way of motion to the House? I remind the Taoiseach that the second part of that decision of Government on receipt of the Oireachtas committee report referred to pursuing the British Government to establish what the Government described as a Weston Park style inquiry into the bombings. What progress has been made on that and what is the disposition of the British authorities on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In all of these reports we have tried to make as little change as possible and only redact names where we think a legal problem could arise. I believe we are only seeking clarification on one area from Mr. Justice Barron on the 1972-73 report. I hope we will be able to bring that report to Cabinet in November. Immediately the Cabinet has dealt with it, which I hope will be before the end of this month, it will be sent to the committee.</P>
        <P>We only recently received the Seamus Ludlow report and that has to be examined. I would still like to clear it this year if possible. It is unlikely that much work will be done on it this year in the committee but at least it would be helpful if the Government could finish its consideration of the report.</P>
        <P>In terms of the process, I understand we have to bring a resolution or order before the House and work is in preparation for that. I spoke to an official this morning who told me he sees no reason we would not have it before the House to pass this session, which would mean that we could commence work. The Government has not yet decided on a suitable person to head the inquiry. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Attorney General&rsquo;s office may have given some thought to this but I have not yet seen a name of who would chair it, whether it be a senior counsel or a judge. I can see some difficulty in being able to get a judge but we will try to do so. I hope we would be able to commence work on it at the beginning of 2005.</P>
        <P>On the Weston Park style inquiry, we have given all the information to the British Government on this and I also gave, as I said in my reply, the full contents of the inquest report. I raised it <Col N="1031"/>with Prime Minister Blair when I met him in his constituency base in Sedgefield some weeks ago. We are awaiting a response from the British authorities on this. Deputies will be aware that, in response to an invitation to appear before the Joint Oireachtas committee, Secretary of State Murphy, replied to the committee that the relevant information uncovered by the British authorities had been shared with Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s inquiry and that he personally ensured the information had been provided to the fullest possible manner consistent with his responsibilities to protect national security and the lives of individuals. We now have to wait.</P>
        <P>The House and joint committee have considered Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s report in great detail and the recommendations of the committee were accepted by Government. I again commend the committee on the way it conducted the examination of the Barron report. I informed the Prime Minister and Paul Murphy that this work deserves full consideration by the British authorities. We have suggested a Weston Park style arrangement but this does not have to be the case if they have some other idea. I considered this the most appropriate and fastest way to proceed. Judge Cory&rsquo;s work has now been accepted internationally and other countries that have difficult cases are looking at the work he did. He put in an enormous effort at a time when his wife was unwell and she subsequently died during the summer. I offer condolences to Judge Cory who came and worked here even at that time.</P>
        <P>It seems like a good way of doing it. If the British have an alternative we would like to hear it but Judge Cory&rsquo;s inquiry proved very efficient and most people internationally who take an interest in the Finucane case believed it was one of the best models they had ever seen. It is as good an idea as we can think of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying that, given the cross-jurisdictional character of the matters at issue here, investigation into them in this jurisdiction can only go so far and be so productive unless there is a positive response from the British authorities on the matters we have raised?</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two separate sections here, or maybe there are three, and I will deal first with the one not related to this question. Judge Cory told us we must carry out inquiries into the Breen and Buchanan murders and the other issues, which we are doing. We cannot argue about anyone not fulfilling the terms of the Cory report if we do not do our part to make the process work so we must do that. On the point about Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s work, and earlier Mr. Justice Hamilton&rsquo;s, there are several issues we can investigate that do not involve the British, for example, why the Garda investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings was wound down in August 1974, why the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not follow up on all the leads that were there and are <Col N="1032"/>highlighted in the report, particularly the information about the white van with the English registration plate parked outside the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in Portland Row, seen later that night parked in the deep sea area of the B&amp; I ferryport in Dublin, and the subsequent contact made with the British Army officers on the ferry leaving that port. This is a huge cross for that family and it must be investigated because none of us will ever be able to explain it to them.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>When one meets the families it seems like yesterday and they do not understand why I and others cannot explain that. I totally understand their position. Somebody must investigate it to bring some closure on this issue. There seems to be a reasonable amount of information about a man who stayed in the Four Courts Hotel between 15 and 17 May 1974 and his contacts with the UVF. There is information concerning a British Army corporal allegedly sighted on several occasions in Dublin at the time of the bombings. Issues such as the exact documentation in the Department and in Garda intelligence and any other documentation of relevance which is unaccounted for, the reasons explaining the missing documentation, whether the missing documentation can be located and whether the systems currently in place are adequate to prevent a recurrence, and other issues raised by the families and the committee can be dealt with in the report.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>The British must investigate the other issues concerning people outside this jurisdiction. We will never get anywhere on those issues. Even if we held the inquiry here the people would not attend so we would be only misleading people. If we can deal comprehensively with what Judge Cory said on these issues and hope the British see the light and deal with their own security position and make some progress on that, we can make real progress. On my watch I can do the first two. As regards the third all I can do is make the case and I have done and will do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach report on implementing the recommendations of Judge Cory in respect of several inquiries? What is the up-to-date position in so far as the inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane is concerned? The Taoiseach asked the British Prime Minister on 10 September to set up an investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. What was Mr. Blair&rsquo;s response to that query and when does the Taoiseach expect that might take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have met the Finucane family. The British Prime Minister was due to meet the family one day this week, maybe yesterday, or today. That is an important meeting. We have totally supported the Finucane family. We have given chapter and verse why we are doing so and that is a consistent line taken by this House over the years. The British have said they will deal with this and other issues in new legislation. It is believed and hoped but not confirmed that it will <Col N="1033"/>be included in the Queen&rsquo;s next speech on 23 November which is the process by which the British highlight forthcoming legislation. That is welcome but we have not seen the legislation. Examination of it will be imperative in determining whether people support it. That is particularly so for Geraldine Finucane who has dedicated her life to this campaign. She will support it only if she is satisfied that it is adequate. I feel duty bound to support her. She is a very reasonable person and there are legal people in this very decent family. She wants bring closure to this. She has been dealing with it for 15 years. I am going to support it to the end. I have made that absolutely clear. The Attorney General has kept close contact with the Finucane family and the various human rights organisations dealing with the case. We will wait and see what the legislation brings but hopefully it will bring us into a process on which we will be able to move.</P>
        <P>We have reports on all the other inquiries, except the last report by Mr. Justice Barron. There are two elements, one concerning the bombings around 1992-93 which will go before the committee before the end of the year. The Seamus Ludlow report will hopefully go before the committee at the beginning of 2005. Regarding the Weston Park initiative, we have to wait. We have given over all our information and I have raised it with the British Government and the Secretary of State. This is our idea. If they can find some other way it is a matter for them to do it. We have also given them the findings of the inquest and asked them to deal with these issues. We await the British response to this.</P>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the bombing of Belturbet in County Cavan in 1972 is included in the second Barron report which the Government received in June along with the report on the Dublin bombings in 1972 and 1973?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that. Will he be more specific about when he expects publication of the second Barron report, given that Government has had it since last June? Will he reconfirm to the House that it will be dealt with by a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, in the same way as the first Barron report was addressed? If it is to be addressed in that way will the Taoiseach use the opportunity today to make a determined call on the British Government to ensure that it will give full co-operation to whatever hearing this House <Col N="1034"/>sets in train through a sub-committee and that it will compel representatives of the Northern Ireland Office, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and any other arm of the British presence in the North of Ireland to come before that sub-committee? It has refused to do that in connection with the hearings on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I expect the Taoiseach does this whenever he is afforded an opportunity to do so?</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that he recently met the relatives of Geraldine O&rsquo;Reilly and Patrick Stanley, who both died in the Belturbet bombing? What can he tell the House about the outcome of that meeting? What about the promise of a commission of investigation into the Garda investigation of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the missing files? Will the terms of reference be published and how soon will that happen? There seems to be an inordinate delay in moving it forward. Will the terms of reference come before the Houses of Oireachtas for approval? Will that report be referred to the Oireachtas committee? Where stands the demand for the British Government to launch an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings along the lines of the Cory report, to which the Taoiseach has already referred? What progress, if any, does he believe the Government is making in pressing the British Government to ensure that it fully co-operates with whatever inquiry is employed, be it on a cross jurisdictional basis or otherwise? Will it have a corresponding inquiry organised along the Cory lines into the Dublin and Monaghan tragedy of 17 May 1974?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our view and the view of the Oireachtas committee that the British should deal with those issues in a Weston Park style inquiry in their jurisdiction. It is unlikely, though not impossible, in our investigation that the kind of people we would like to appear will appear. That is the difficulty. Naturally, where we need them we will look for them and hopefully we will get co-operation. That is why the Oireachtas report dealt with these things in two areas. I explained to Deputy Rabbitte that there are three areas in the Cory report. In the two areas raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, all of the issues I have mentioned will be investigated by the commission, including the Garda files. There were two reasons for the delay since July. It arrived during the holiday season and the Government had to examine it. There is one area of clarification which we have been seeking and trying to resolve with Mr. Justice Barron. I hope that will happen soon. The legislation to allow for the commission was not completed. That is now completed so we can move ahead. An order will be brought before the House to make the necessary regulations so the commission can start its work in 2005.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my interjection, Belturbet, Clones and Pettigo are included in that report. Mr. Justice Barron also reports on a number of <Col N="1035"/>other bombings and murders in his appendices to the report. It is more extensive than that. That report will be before the Government shortly and will be sent to the committee by the end of this month or early in December. The Seamus Ludlow report, which we only received recently, is being examined. I hope to get it through the Government by Christmas so that it will be ready for the committee. It may make sense for the committee to deal with the bombings in 1972 and 1973 and the Seamus Ludlow case together, though I do not want to be telling the committee how to proceed.</P>
        <P>I met families of the Belturbet bombings over the years and I continue to keep in touch with all of these families. They are glad that the Government has reached the report stage of this issue. We advised them comprehensively of the process. They asked that we keep in touch with them and we will. They are also dealing with the commission on their own personal matters.</P>
        <P>I will keep the pressure on the British in so far as we can get them to co-operate and deal with these areas as it is the only way to bring closure. It is important that we deal with all of the elements that are in our hands on these issues. After 30 years, we are now in a position where we can do all that we possibly can and my intention is to see that through in 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Like everyone else in this House, I am aware the Taoiseach supports a full public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane and others. In agreeing to establish a commission to investigate the disappearance of security files and Garda behaviour during the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, is it consistent to allow that to be in private while at the same time calling for public inquiries elsewhere? For many people, particularly the Justice for the Forgotten group, it is an irreconcilable situation. They would like to know the reason for not having a public inquiry. Have the terms been agreed for that inquiry? It was mentioned in September that a Cabinet meeting would agree the terms. What is the update on this? Will the Government support the pursuit of the case to the European Court of Human Rights by the Justice for the Forgotten group? On the basis of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the British Government needs to co-operate with inquiries into loss of life. Is the Irish Government in a position to provide any support to help bring that matter to fruition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Judge Cory&rsquo;s recommendations included a number of inquiries. We will have full public inquiries on the Buchanan and Breen cases and another area as well. They will be full inquiries and will be consistent. We will deal with the Finucane case as Judge Cory recommended. The commission will be set up on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings when an order is brought before the House with the terms of reference. We <Col N="1036"/>are doing what we are asking the British Government to do.</P>
        <P>British-Irish Rights Watch and a number of other bodies have been exploring a number of areas. I spoke to the people involved in this on a number of occasions. Those issues are ongoing and I do not wish to make any statement on them as they have been looking at a number of areas and have been in touch with the Attorney General on the matter. I am not sure of the latest position, but British-Irish Rights Watch and other organisations have been following the Finucane case, in particular, and other cases. They have been in to see me a number of times about the European dimension. I think their tactics are to wait and see what happens on the British side, particularly in regard to legislation that should be outlined in a speech on 23 November in the Commons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach give an up to date position on the report presented to the Government on the Omagh bombing? There were a number of outstanding matters there and some ongoing discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what the latest is on the various issues being pursued by the families and the groups. It is some time since I met them but I will get an update.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision of the Taoiseach to refer the second Barron report to a committee. I presume he was referring to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. No action has yet been taken, six months after the committee considered the first Barron report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and made a fairly comprehensive set of recommendations. Its first recommendation was that the report be referred to the British Houses of Parliament. The committee asked the Houses of Parliament to adopt the report, which has been accepted by all sides of this House. In other words, the committee recommended that the first action should be to go to the British Parliament, before going to the British Government.</P>
        <P>The second action which was recommended was to seek a Weston Park-type investigation into the bombings. If the investigation was not achieved, it was recommended that we should start to prepare a case for the European Court of Human Rights. We should ask the court, based on the nature of the act which was perpetrated on the citizens of this country by another jurisdiction, to compel Britain to fulfil its obligations in this regard. Has the State started to prepare the case to be made at the European Court of Human Rights?</P>
        <P>Can I ask the Taoiseach about the commission of investigation? I understood there would be two separate commissions of investigation in this jurisdiction because there are two separate issues. The first investigation would relate to the missing <Col N="1037"/>Garda and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform files and the second investigation would relate to the premature termination of the Garda inquiry. Can the Taoiseach outline the action which has been taken in this jurisdiction and the British jurisdiction in respect of the committee&rsquo;s specific recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With the greatest respect, a Cheann Comhairle, this is total repetition. I have said all of this before, but I do not mind saying it again. In response to Deputy Costello&rsquo;s first point, we noted when we made our original decision in July that the committee had recommended that a resolution be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing the joint committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and inviting the UK Parliament to make a similar resolution. I publicly announced in July that we would accept the first recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>If communication took place with the British Parliament, what was the response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, we outlined it at the meeting in Sedgefield. We have provided all the papers, including the inquest reports, most recently to Paul Murphy, but we have not yet received a response from the British Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee recommended that the British Parliament be contacted and given a copy of the document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is precisely what happened. The Government decided on 14 July last to note the recommendation that a resolution be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing the joint committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations and inviting the UK Parliament to pass a similar resolution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>It can make a request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government made requests at the meeting in Sedgefield and at a meeting with Paul Murphy. We have done that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I think there are two separate issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Costello to allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the first recommendation has been followed through, from the point of view of the Government. I do not want to answer for the Oireachtas, but it has been followed through. We will not pursue the option of taking a case to the European Court of Justice until we get a response. We will not pursue it on the other lines, in relation to Geraldine Finucane and others. They do not want to pursue that route. In Geraldine Finucane&rsquo;s case, for example, they want to pursue the legislation to see what happens and if it is adequate.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the commission of investigation. There are two issues in that regard &mdash; why the Garda investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was wound down in 1974 and, as the Deputy correctly said, why the Garda did not pursue certain specific leads. I will not go through the leads again because I placed them on the record earlier. I think the matters should be investigated by a single commission. The commission which we establish should reflect this in its terms of reference. It would be unwieldy, unnecessary and costly to have two separate commissions undertaking investigations. There are two issues.</P>
        <P>The Government has accepted fully the report&rsquo;s recommendations, which are being taken to the commission. The commission legislation has been passed. We are in the process of examining the terms of reference of the commission. As I said earlier, the terms of reference and the order for the commission have to be passed by the House. We then have to appoint a senior counsel or a judge, unless it is a High Court judge, to undertake the investigation. I hope the Government will have done what it needs to do before Christmas. The commission will then be able to begin its work in the new year, hopefully.</P><Col N="1039"/>
        <P>Other reports relate to the 1972 and 1973 reports, the bombings in Belturbet, Clones and Pettigo and related issues and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. I hope we will see the third report, which deals with other related issues, mainly murders which took place between 1970 and 1975, by Christmas. That report will also be sent to the committee. I can confirm that we will deal with it in exactly the same way as we dealt with the first report.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the statute law revision unit of the Office of the Attorney General undertook an audit of all legislation enacted between 1235 and 1922 that is still in force in the State. It was decided to concentrate on the public general Acts to ascertain the Acts which continue to be of practical utility and are in use and to identify Acts which are no longer required. The unit concentrated on the possible repeal of legislation that might affect competitiveness, was contrary to the Constitution or international obligations or was written in such archaic language that it no longer added value. The unit successfully identified a significant number of obsolete Acts. A consultation process was launched in April 2004, involving the unit and all Departments, with the intention of confirming the identified Acts which could be safely repealed. The public was informed by means of advertisements and invited to respond. The consultation process between the Departments and the unit is continuing. It is intended to complete the process and to publish a statute law revision Bill, which will repeal the obsolete Acts, during the current D&aacute;il session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suppose there is much point in teasing out this matter further, given that we have been down this road before. I accept that some of the statutes being repealed are historical curiosities. Can the Taoiseach remind the House of the purpose of this exercise? Is it being done to facilitate ease of reference by practitioners of the law? Will it have other practical use?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1040"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take questions from Deputies Sargent and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in before the Taoiseach responds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When the approximately 100 old statutes are being prepared for deletion, will there some consultation with the House so that some of them can be retained? I refer, for example, to the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which is good legislation even in today&rsquo;s terms. Will Deputies see the list of Acts before the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; button is pressed? Many of the Acts continue to have a real impact today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the list I have seen, the legislation to be repealed goes back as far as 1310 and includes the Baths and Warehouses Act, the Chimney Sweepers&rsquo; Regulation Act and the Act relating to the pillory. While some would say the pillory should be introduced for use against certain Ministers or Members, those are long-redundant legacies. Since we are dealing with an outdated and in some cases unjust legacy of the past, will the Taoiseach earnestly tell the House that he intends to address the ground rent Bill, which also deals with such a legacy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have these questions. I call Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say whether that is a valid question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it does. Will it be included in the proposition to repeal outdated and no longer applicable legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, we have been down this road before. Is the net intention to have a set of revised statutes, which is what we should be undertaking? Is the intended end result that everyone will have open access to what is involved in clearly comprehensible language?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The final reply from the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of work is going on in this area. It started when Mr. Gleeson, as Attorney General, listed all the Acts on the Statute Book on a CD-ROM. Modern technology highlighted the fact that we had approximately 500 Acts dating back to 1235, which are still law because they have never been amended or repealed. The consultation process that Deputy Sargent pointed out is important, since we do not want to remove anything that is relevant. The purpose is to get rid of the irrelevant Acts. Over the summer, the Attorney General initiated a public consultation on this important issue through advertisements. I assume that it went to <Col N="1041"/>Deputies, but if not, I can arrange that they receive a copy.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question is very important: why do it in the first place? It affects practitioners and others using our legislation in all sorts of areas &mdash; not just the legal profession, since I understand that our law on conveyancing and liquor licensing is a nightmare. An enormous number of Acts have not been consolidated. Those involved must literally go back to 1300 every time they try to do something. The Deputy and I are familiar with social welfare and tax consolidation, which we have managed, but there are many other areas. The intention is to get rid of unnecessary legislative clutter that is out of date and should be repealed.</P>
        <P>The second task is to identify legislation that is still important but should be updated. Much of what is there is relevant but must be brought up to date. Trying to streamline the Statute Book also reduces the transaction costs associated with legal and general administration. The view is that it would in many cases lead to better regulation and by extension better competitiveness. The pre-1922 project will also serve to enhance the accessibility of the law by weeding out those Acts that are no longer relevant. To answer the question of Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, the end of the line, which will probably take some years to reach, will be when we have got rid of all the Acts that are unnecessary and, second, found a way &mdash; as I believe has been done through the statutory law revision &mdash; to update Acts that are not irrelevant in one Act. We can do that by working with the language and bringing it forward, and the task has now been identified. Approximately 400 Acts must be addressed, but at least one would be dealing only with the latest or current Act.</P>
        <P>The third task concerns where there is a great deal of law, for example, codifying the law on liquor licensing and criminal law, and modernising the law on conveyancing and landlord and tenant law, which would bring all the Acts up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about ground rents?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must initiate a scoping exercise to determine how courts legislation might be modernised. Whenever a Department examined any such area, rather than simply doing what it wanted, it would consolidate. That will take many years, but even if it took 20 or 25, we would be up to date at the end, which is the general purpose. Much as I love the Attorney General and his office, it does not always provide the fastest moving service in the world; that is no disrespect to him, since delays relate to the demand from these Houses. So that we might get a handle on this, I asked the office of the Attorney General to engage PA Consultants to assist the statute law revision unit in drawing up a business plan to advise the Government on the possibility of undertaking a complete restatement of Irish <Col N="1042"/>statute law. At least there is a plan to reach the end game, even if it takes some years.</P>

	<P>I have two questions. Last week I raised the issue uncovered by Deputy Perry of persons over 70 who had received medical cards being charged for long-stay places in public institutions. The Taoiseach said the Attorney General was providing advice to the Government. Has that advice now been given, and, in line with what the Taoiseach said, will there be legislation based on it not already included in the published list?</P>
      <P>The harbours Bill is due for publication in 2005. Can the Taoiseach state clearly when that might be produced?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1043"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>After Deputy Kenny raised the first issue last week, I spoke to the Attorney General and asked that whoever was dealing with the matter in his office try to quicken the process. He told me on Monday that he is examining the issue himself and will give final advice to the Government as quickly as possible. The heads of the harbour Bill have been prepared. It is to update the Acts of 1946 to 2000, but it will be published no earlier than next year, since the heads are not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost 600 people lost their jobs through the closure of the <i>Irish Press</i>. Does the Government intend to have the company investigated given last night&rsquo;s programme about the company&rsquo;s highly irregular governance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bills listed in section C are Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved, such as the Dublin metro Bill. The Taoiseach told us that Bill would be published in 2005 but recently said that we need not wait on the metro at all, so the purpose of the Bill remains a mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question? This matter was dealt with yesterday on the Order of Business and again this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say when the Bill is to be published and what its meaning is? Is there a list of Bills which the Taoiseach does not intend to proceed with, such as the greater Dublin area land use and transport Bill, and the Transport Authority Bill, which I understand are now removed? It seems there are Bills with which the Government will not proceed and which are there only for show. Can we have that list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy objectives of the Dublin greater area land use and transport Bill can be addressed within the existing and proposed structures such as regional land use stra<Col N="1044"/>tegies, consistent with the national spatial strategy, the Dublin Transportation Office strategic transport planning, the establishment of an independent national public transport procurement and regulatory body and the metro Bill, which is designed to streamline and accelerate procedures metro projects and reduce costs.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of this Bill have been approved by Government. I do not yet know when the Bill will ready.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about organising a debate in the House on the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which dealt with the cost of building land, an issue referred to the committee by the Taoiseach. He told me that he would raise the matter of a debate with the Whips. Has he done so?</P>

      <P>T&aacute; an &aacute;thas orm teacht os comhair an T&iacute; inniu leis an Bhille t&aacute;bhachtach seo. Seo &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad uair bheith ag tabhairt reachta&iacute;ocht &oacute;s comhar na D&aacute;la mar Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta agus tuigim go bhfuil seo an-th&aacute;bachtach ar fad domsa agus dar nd&oacute;igh don Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to bring the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill before the House. It is a particular privilege for me that this is my first piece of legislation to introduce before the House as Minister for Education and Science. I have a personal interest in this legislation, having spent six years actively involved in the Dublin Institute of Technology, having been chairman of the Dublin College of Catering for some years and on the boards of two of the other colleges, as well as on the governing authority of the Dublin Institute of Technology. I recognise as much as <Col N="1048"/>anyone else in this House the contribution which that institute has made and continues to make to education not just in the city of Dublin but to Ireland as a whole. It is the largest education provider in the State. It is a significant institute of education but its activities are scattered across a number of different campuses throughout the city. The Bill is, therefore, an important steppingstone in terms of the development of a new education and health campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology. I know all Members of the House, the education sector and the wider community in Grangegorman will welcome it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In December 1999 the Government decided that the Department of Education and Science would purchase 65 acres of the 73 acre Grangegorman site from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and that the new Dublin Institute of Technology community campus would be housed there. In May 2001 the Taoiseach, who has taken a personal interest in this development, established an interdepartmental working group with a view to examining the project and reporting back to Cabinet with its recommendations. In July 2001 the group appointed consultants to carry out a strategic review of the issues associated with the development of the Grangegorman site on its behalf.</P>
      <P>The consultancy report was delivered in November 2001. The strategic conclusions and recommendations it contained included that the Grangegorman site is a unique and valuable public asset and should be developed in an integrated and sustainable manner; that an integrated site plan should be prepared with a view to securing outline planning permission; that the health care and educational requirements could be developed on a phased basis; that the affordability of the project should be determined at the outset and, therefore, the Government should determine the broad budgetary parameters for a phase one development; and that a Grangegorman development company should be established to project manage the development and determine the type of procurement to be employed. In April 2002 the Government decided that a statutory Grangegorman development agency would be established to commence work on an integrated urban design and land use framework plan for the Grangegorman site and to manage the development of the site as agent for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Departments involved.</P>
      <P>In light of its size and location &mdash; a 73 acre site virtually in the heart of the city, located within walking distance of the capital&rsquo;s main street &mdash; the Grangegorman site is a unique and valuable public asset of strategic importance to Dublin city as a whole and must be developed in an integrated and sustainable manner. Due to the fact that it is located in a densely populated residential area, development of the site will require great sensitivity. The Bill before the House provides for setting up the Grangegorman develop<Col N="1049"/>ment agency to undertake the development of the site as a location for education, health and other purposes.</P>
      <P>In examining the possible uses of this strategic site, the Government took account not only of the needs of DIT but of the need to regenerate this underdeveloped area of Dublin city. The Government is conscious that the integration of the proposed development with the existing community would produce benefits beyond the actual Grangegorman site.</P>
      <P>DIT can trace its origins to 1887 and the foundation of technical education in Ireland. The institute was created in 1992, subsuming a number of higher education institutions previously administered under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. During the past ten years the organisation has gone through an active process of invention, moulding individual site-bound institutions into a single academic body. The strength of these structures was recognised in 1998 with the award of independent degree granting powers, up to and including doctorates.</P>
      <P>DIT offers a combination of academic, professional, applied and technological education, from apprentice-based training, through certificate, diploma and degree courses to postgraduate masters and doctoral students. Outside of direct school intake, DIT has an extensive range of continuing and professional development courses in a variety of formats, catering in large part to mature students. The range, from apprentice up, and the variety of courses has meant that DIT has been particularly successful at attracting students from all strata of society.</P>
      <P>The applied and technological bases of many programmes means DIT courses are firmly rooted in many key areas of the economy, providing educated graduates and a unique level of expertise. This has fostered a close interaction with industry in specific disciplines. Industry-specific research centres and active innovation and incubation activities strengthen these industrial links. Growth of research activities in targeted niche areas of expertise has allowed DlT to compete successfully for funding under various Government programmes and on the wider EU stage.</P>
      <P>Currently, DIT is spread over 39 buildings on 30 sites throughout Dublin. Most Deputies will be familiar with the institute&rsquo;s Bolton Street, Kevin Street and Aungier Street premises. However, a considerable number of smaller rented spaces are also in use. The cost of rent alone amounts to &euro;4.15 million per annum. There are clearly serious operational inefficiencies in seeking to manage and operate a major institution such as DIT over such a wide variety of locations. These not only militate severely against operational effectiveness but have adverse cost implications in a wide variety of areas, namely, security, porterage, heating, lighting, administration, registration, records, support services, dining arrangements, library, intercommunication, etc. The <Col N="1050"/>institute currently has seven libraries, eight admissions offices, seven examination offices and ten canteens. A major benefit of consolidation would be a significant increase in the quality and scope of operational service that could be offered on campus within existing budgetary parameters.</P>
      <P>The limited space available to the institute is compounded by the current condition of some of its premises. The institute&rsquo;s Bolton Street and Kevin Street facilities require refurbishment and modernisation. The cost of this work alone is estimated at &euro;100 million.</P>
      <P>The poor quality of much of the existing DIT building stock and overall infrastructure has hampered the institute in responding to national manpower needs. The number of students entering higher education in Ireland grew substantially in the past decade. Between 1994 and 2002 student numbers in higher education increased from 90,000 to 127,000. During this period, the institute experienced record numbers of applications and has consistently remained in one of the top three positions in respect of overall applications. Space restrictions imposed on the institute have meant that it has not been in a position to fully respond to this demand. The current educational and research provision of the institute is, as stated earlier, delivered from 30 locations across the greater Dublin area. The institute currently occupies a total site area of approximately 11 acres. No other comparable higher education institution in the State has such a restricted and fragmented site area.</P>
      <P>Of greatest significance for DIT is the level of educational efficiency and effectiveness that can be achieved, through consolidation of its many sites on a single campus, in terms of the development and delivery of its programmes, fostering of cross-disciplinary programmes in line with emerging trends, developing multidisciplinary research and having the physical capacity to build on its research initiatives. Furthermore, the existence of a single campus setting will enhance its presence and expand its alliances with industry in a variety of areas &mdash; consultancy, training, research &mdash; and overall through the creation of a learning environment. Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in these areas is critical for DIT in seeking to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive higher education environment.</P>
      <P>A range of reports &mdash; including the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences, published by Forf&aacute;s in 2002, the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, published in 1995, the Report of the Review Committee on lost Secondary Education and Training Places, published in 1999, and the Technology Foresight Ireland Report prepared by the Irish Council for Science and Technology Innovation &mdash; all emphasise the strategic nature of science and technology to the Irish economy. It is a mainstay of Government policy and critical to the economic sustainability of the country. For more than a century, the faculties of science, engineering and the built environment have played a key role provid<Col N="1051"/>ing graduates in mathematics, computer sciences, physics, chemistry, engineering, technology, architecture and biology to underpin the science and technology sectors within the economy. In the past 30 years, economic development has been strongly based on encouraging inward investment of high technology companies with major success. The most recent re-orientation towards high cost, high value added industries in the science and technology sectors will make further demands on higher education to deliver the quality of graduate to meet these challenges.</P>
      <P>DIT&rsquo;s commitment to this strategy is reflected in the fact that 45% of the degree programmes on offer through the institute are science and technology-based.</P>
      <P>The move to Grangegorman will provide the basic research infrastructure, allowing the institute to optimise the resources available and to maximise their exploitation. As the equipment and resources for research, particularly in science and technology, becomes increasingly expensive, the opportunities to share equipment across multidisciplinary teams will be greatly facilitated on a single site. Opportunities for new and emerging activities will be greatly increased and a more efficient use of space and facilities can be implemented as groups and activities expand and contract over time. The institute has identified strategic areas for growth and explicit provision for growth has been made on the new campus. The DIT has traditionally supplied top class graduates to the tourism industry, which continues to expand and is of major importance to the State. DIT will also expand in this area.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman campus will bring together and cluster research activity within the institute in a highly visible and coherent manner. The increase in prominence of research and its associated infrastructure as a central activity of a third level institution is one of the greatest changes to occur in third level education. The opportunity to design a new campus offers a unique opportunity for research facilities to be designed as an integral part of the core campus, rather than tacked on to the periphery as is the cash with older institutions. The DIT strategic brief for the new campus strongly articulates that research should be a clear and visible up-front activity to signal its centrality to the mission of the institute, strengthen the links between research and the core undergraduate courses and encourage undergraduate students to continue to postgraduate research.</P>
      <P>Government policy has identified research, underpinning the move to a knowledge-based economy, as one of the key strategies for future economic growth and development. This is supported at EU level by the agreement to increase research spending from a little more than 2% to 3% of GDP. Programmes such as the programme for research in third level institutions, the Science Foundation of Ireland and other initiatives such as those outlined in the Forf&aacute;s annual report, <Col N="1052"/>2002 Review and 2003 Outlook, underline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving these goals. The ultimate requirement is for a ready supply and up-skilling of graduate and post graduate knowledge workers.</P>
      <P>The need to acquire this expertise has been recognised in publications such as Baseline assessment of the public research system in Ireland in the areas of Biotechnology and ICT and by the award of major funding from the PRTLI and SFI programmes. DIT has received four major awards amounting to more than &euro;8 million under SFI. These research activities are complemented by 29 full-time and 12 part-time taught postgraduate programmes, of which five are new programmes to be introduced in 2003. Progress in research has been severely hampered by a lack of space and suitable infrastructure. The distributed nature of the institute has militated against the pooling of resources, and the exploitation of new and emerging cross-disciplinary fields of study.</P>
      <P>Some of the work is &ldquo;blue skies&rdquo; in nature whilst much of it is applied and is conducted with and-or for industry. The following examples give an insight into the research and innovation activities currently taking place at DIT and hint at some of the exciting opportunities that are coming down the line; geospatial data research team, vision sciences research group and digital media centre.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for an agency to provide a cohesive planning and implementation framework for the Grangegorman site. The functions of the agency are detailed and appropriate to its task because of the nature, importance and the size of the project. Part 2 provides that the primary function of the agency will be to promote the Grangegorman site as a location for education, health and other facilities and to co-ordinate the development or redevelopment of the site. This part also enables the agency to enter arrangements to exploit research, development or consultancy work undertaken by or on behalf of the agency.</P>
      <P>The present estimated cost of developing the DIT campus is approximately &euro;900 million. However, this is a preliminary estimate. The cost will depend on start dates, phasing and the type of procurement to be used. The agency will be required to prepare full costings as part of the development master plan and to decide on the best form of procurement in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>It was originally envisaged that the DIT campus would be developed on a phased basis. While it was anticipated that the initial phase would be financed through my Department with Exchequer funds, the agency will now examine the most advantageous funding options available in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency. The NDFA is responsible for providing advice to State authorities on financing of priority infrastructure projects and providing <Col N="1053"/>consultancy services across the range of technical expertise necessary to undertake such projects.</P>
      <P>The development of the Grangegorman site as a campus for DIT is underpinned by the sale or development of existing DIT premises to finance future stages of development. This part of the Bill, therefore, makes provision for the vesting of these premises in the agency, together with other land and property vacated by the Eastern Regional Health Authority or its successor agency. The DIT-owned properties will be signed over to the agency, as they become available. The agency will then dispose of the property. The income generated will be used to fund the project together with other resources. I have mentioned a number of the buildings located in the heart of Dublin city, with which Members will be familiar, and everybody will accept they are valuable.</P>
      <P>The agency will be the sole authority for developing the site. The agency will be required to engage in the planning process and decide on the appropriate procurement strategy to achieve this. The legislation requires the agency to arrange an appropriate communication strategy and consult stakeholders and relevant interested third parties such as Dublin City Council, CIE and Dublin Bus because of the complexity and sensitivity of the development.</P>
      <P>The area surrounding the site is primarily residential. The development of the site must, therefore, be approached with sensitivity. The Bill incorporates provision for extensive consultation with all interested parties for this reason. These include local residents and health care staff and patients located on or near the site, the academic and student bodies of Dublin Institute of Technology, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, and the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children. The local residents, in particular, need to be fully included in all the consultations and developments that are taking place. It is a strategically important site but I am conscious that the wishes and needs of the residents should be taken on board.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides, on completion of the construction phase, for the vesting of those lands and premises to be occupied by DIT, the health authority or other educational body into the ownership of the respective authority, institute or other body. Section 9 allows for additional functions to be conferred on the agency by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 10 provides that the Minister for Education and Science may issue general directives to the agency on policy regarding the agency&rsquo;s assigned functions.</P>
      <P>Grangegorman is a unique site and is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole. Dublin City Council will be involved with the planning and development of the site from the outset. Section 11, therefore, provides that the agency will be responsible for drawing up a strategic development plan for the site, with a focus on the provision of adequate public transport <Col N="1054"/>access. The plan, which will be a necessary condition of seeking and obtaining planning permission, should incorporate community use and access and be informed by a high quality urban design perspective. The plan must set out the objectives for the development including the needs of the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, Dublin Institute of Technology, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board. In addition, the plan must take account of the needs of the local community and the city.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the proposed development and the likely impact on the locality, the agency, in drawing up the plan must have regard to the Dublin city development plan and the views of statutory bodies such as Dublin Bus and other interested parties. The Bill, therefore, provides that the draft plan must be made available to these bodies, local residents and other interested parties. The agency will be required to consider submissions made by them and, where appropriate, amend the plan.</P>
      <P>Section 13 makes provision for the making of grants to the agency by the Minister for Education and Science or any other Minister, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance. Section 14 is an enabling provision to provide the agency with the power to raise loans to a limit of &euro;100 million, subject to the approval of the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance. Section 15 provides guarantees by the Minister for Finance for these loans. This is a standard provision which gives the Minister for Finance power to guarantee borrowings of the agency.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the make-up of the agency, the Government was cognisant of the need to provide a direct input from the parties most interested in the development of Grangegorman and the need to drive the development forward. In limiting the board of the agency to 11 members, the Government has sought to balance the requirement to represent the principal stakeholders. The Bill provides for the appointment of 11 members to the agency, including the chairman. These will include two members to be nominated by the Minister for Health and Children, including one from either the Eastern Regional Health Authority or the Northern Area Health Board or their successor authorities; one member nominated by the Dublin Institute of Technology; one member nominated by the Dublin City Manager and the remainder nominated by the Minister for Education and Science. The term of office of the chairman and each ordinary member shall be three years.</P>
      <P>Section 20 of the Bill requires the agency to form a consultative group consisting of stakeholders in the project and will include local residents in the Grangegorman neighbourhood, health care service providers and patients, Dublin City Council, Dublin Institute of Technology staff and students, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, certain other Ministers and such statutory bodies which <Col N="1055"/>the Minister deems relevant. The agency is required to develop a communications strategy and is required to hold as many meetings as required to maintain the communications strategy.</P>
      <P>Sections 21 to 38, inclusive, deal with the chief executive officer and staff of the agency and cover such matters as superannuation, code of conduct, declaration of interests and reports by the agency to the Minister. Section 39 of the Bill deals with the dissolution of the agency.</P>
      <P>Sections 40 and 41 amend the definition of agency in the Planning and Development Act 2000 to include the Grangegorman Development Agency and the Schedule to the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 to include the Grangegorman Development Agency. The thinking underpinning the location of the largest education provider in the State on this site is its effect on the surrounding area. In general this area requires redevelopment. The location of DIT in the locality will greatly enhance not just the educational facilities in the area but will contribute significantly to both cultural and social life. Furthermore, it is envisaged that new sports and recreational facilities will be available to local residents.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman development is a catalyst for development and rejuvenation of a large tract of the city landscape. Experience indicates that this type of development can speed the process of regeneration and in the process create a vibrant community for all concerned. The city council of Philadelphia in the United States estimate that the move by the University of Philadelphia to a brownstone city development stimulated regeneration in the inner city. Initial indications are that the development of DCU and the institute of technology in Tallaght have contributed positively to local development. The uptake of third level education in Tallaght has increased significantly since the institute opened.</P>
      <P>The provision of third level education in such areas has a positive impact on participation in education and in economic development. The north inner city currently experiences Ireland&rsquo;s lowest rate of participation in higher education. The campus will further co-ordinate the contribution that the institute can make to improving participation rates in higher education. At present the institute has formal links with 30 inner city primary schools and has a range of initiatives targeting enhanced participation. The DIT has 30 full-time staff working in community projects such as interaction with primary schools and study groups in secondary schools. For instance, the institute participated in a programme to introduce technology into socially disadvantaged areas. With Dublin City Council and Hewlett Packard the institute has set up computer centres in nine flats complexes in the city. The institute also runs a special programme for 250 economically disadvantaged students. The consolidation of these services on the Grange<Col N="1056"/>gorman site will allow for greater focus in this area of community participation and will give greater dynamic to the community outreach programme.</P>
      <P>In its strategy document, Dublin, a City of Possibilities, Dublin City Council recognises the important contribution of third level institutions to the development of the city under the banner of A Learning City. The Dublin City Development Plan 2005-2011 designates Grangegorman a framework development area and a strategic objective of the city.</P>
      <P>Approximately 10% of the Grangegorman site is intended for development of health care facilities for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It is intended to refocus and reorient St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital campus. This will include a move from institutional to more appropriate community settings and a move from regional to local focus in health care provision, including a move from acute care to rehabilitation. This will include the provision of a more appropriate environment for those availing of the facilities. In addition, the creation of a joint education and health campus will provide opportunities to create synergies in developing appropriate model of care and development in specialist areas such as optometry, clinical-hospital measurement, dietetics and nutrition, social care, early childhood studies and health services management. It is also anticipated that the on-site co-operation between education and health care providers will lead to the development of tailored courses.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board are responsible for the planning of health facilities in this locality. Currently it is anticipated that the health development on the site will include residential and day care for intellectually impaired and young physically impaired people, residential and day care for the elderly and dementia sufferers.</P>
      <P>The siting of all the DIT at this north inner city location will make a significant contribution to the redevelopment of this part of the city. This role will extend to education and training, underpinning economic activity within the surrounding area, enhancing access opportunities, extending cultural facilities, provision of recreational and sporting facilities, rebuilding and developing large areas of dereliction and creating direct and indirect employment opportunities. To this end the institute is working in close co-operation with my Department, Dublin City Council, representative groups, development associations and agencies, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Northern Area Health Board.</P>
      <P>This proposal for the setting up of the agency will lead to a very exciting development on the Grangegorman site, a development which will create a new centre of excellence and expertise for the DIT. The institute will be enabled to draw all its component parts together and build on its history of achievement over the past 120 or 130 years. The centre will allow for student partici<Col N="1057"/>pation because they will have a single site which will provide a sense of identity that has perhaps been lost. The siting of the institute will benefit the local community and enable it to avail of the sporting, social and recreational facilities with the education facilities which will be provided for local people. It will also provide an impetus to Dublin city for the regeneration of the whole area.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies will agree with me regarding the very positive benefits of this Bill for the long-term development of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Enright for sharing her time with me. I welcome the general thrust of this Bill. I have one question about the Bill. The Grangegorman site is on the north side of the city and the Guinness site and CIE site are on the south side. I wonder why housing is not incorporated into those sites, given the need for housing in the city. Housing can exist side by side with commerce and it can certainly exist side by side with institutions. I ask the Minister to consider that proposition.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed with the documents, Dublin 2020 and Our Vision for the Future of the City, by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. The documents set out its strategic thinking on the future of the city. When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I found myself in trouble when I tried to give some leadership in strategic thinking by setting up the Dublin International Sports Council, founding the Dublin Impac literary awards, setting up a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s commission on housing and another on crime, under Judge Moriarty. We were trying to be strategic at that time. Many good developments are being carried out in the city such as the IFSC and the digital hub. However, there is no strategic leadership at city or county level giving Dublin the type of profile it requires. On the other side of the coin, this House was treated discourteously when what was termed decentralisation was added on to the end of the Minister&rsquo;s speech as if it was of no relevance. The Minister then added the words, &ldquo;We need to take steps against the Dublin mindset&rdquo;. That is the issue I want to address.</P>
      <P>I am sick and tired listening to people talking negatively about Dublin as if it is a terrible place. Dublin is not a terrible place. It has improved greatly over the years, and I accept this Bill will add to that, but there is too much disjointed work going on in the development of Dublin. It is too easy for people to say it is a terrible place, that one cannot drive in Dublin and so on. We constantly hear people who have that attitude to Dublin. That attitude, and I say this sensitively, is added to by the fact that there are people representing Dublin who have secondary loyalties to areas outside Dublin. Between 30% and 40% of public representatives in Dublin are not native Dubliners. That is not a major issue. Much of the population of Dublin is not native but I expect people who are elected to constituencies in Dublin to speak for Dublin.</P><Col N="1058"/>
      <P>The essence of my point is that nobody is speaking for Dublin. The Minister is speaking for the Grangegorman site. Somebody else is speaking for another site. There is no strategic leadership for Dublin. The Minister referred in her contribution to the Dublin City Council document. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce has the document. A good deal of thinking has gone into the sort of leadership and game plan we need for Dublin but we need something along the lines of what they have in London. Ken Livingstone did not become an alternative focus to 10 Downing Street. He has not even overshadowed the Lord Mayor of London in the City because the City has a different priority but in the greater London area he has been able to give some leadership on strategic issues. Even the police work hand in glove with his administration.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill and want to see this site developed, I hope the Minister will take on board my comments about housing. I want her to take back to Cabinet, from one of those people elected as a councillor, a Deputy and now an MEP for Dublin, and a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, my concerns that nobody is giving political leadership, strategically, for Dublin.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider this one point. I am aware Dublin Chamber of Commerce is seeking a mayor and an authority for the whole of the greater Dublin area, and I see some sense in that, but could we start by having the Lord Mayor of Dublin city directly elected so that people might get used to having a figurehead who does not change every year but at least gives some political and strategic leadership for the city? We need somebody who will stand up for the city because I do not see too many people in Cabinet or those who have secondary loyalties elsewhere standing up for Dublin when negative comments are made about it. I ask the Minister to take that point back to the Cabinet so that the strategic thinking the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Dublin City Council, Fine Gael and I want to see come about can be given to the sort of leadership required. I generally welcome the Bill and I thank Deputy Enright for her time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that this Bill has come before the House. It was published during the summer and a commitment was given then to proceed with it as soon as possible. I thank the Minister for honouring that commitment.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it. This legislation should signal a new beginning for the Dublin Institute of Technology, incorporating facilities that will boost the capabilities of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It should also offer a considerable impetus for development to the Dublin north inner city area in which Grangegorman is located.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Dublin Institute of Technology is Ireland&rsquo;s largest educational institution. With 20,500 students, 10,000 of whom are full-<Col N="1059"/>time, DIT has 85 full-time and 200 part-time educational programmes. A total of 4,000 people graduate each year with a qualification from DIT.</P>
      <P>The recent OECD review of third level education policy in Ireland has reaffirmed the importance of third level education here. Our universities and institutes of technology have played a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic achievements and broader social development. This role was accelerated in the 1990s, and the third level educational sector is frequently spoken of, sometimes in a &ldquo;tokenistic&rdquo; way but also in a more important and serious way, as being the guardian of Ireland&rsquo;s future economic security. This is an onerous responsibility but one the sector must be equipped and funded to meet if it is to become more than a token and if it is to play such an important part in our collective future.</P>
      <P>We should recognise the considerable contribution the Dublin Institute of Technology is making to the third level infrastructure and achievement not only of Dublin but of the country as a whole. This considerable contribution, however, has been beset by substantial difficulties that are related to the current restraints under which DIT operates. It is difficult to fully develop and realise one&rsquo;s potential when the constraints one deals with on a day to day basis are often to do with practical and physical infrastructural problems.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the DIT is located in 30 locations around the city, in 39 buildings, many of which are unsuitable for the demands of a 21st century educational establishment. Furthermore, these buildings require substantial improvement works. The lack of a central and inclusive campus has without doubt impacted in a less than positive way upon DIT and the large student body at the institute.</P>
      <P>In purely monetary terms, it is estimated that it would cost up to &euro;200 million to bring the buildings that are in use at DIT up to a modern standard. Health and safety works are required at many locations, with the faculty of science alone requiring an investment of &euro;50 million to meet basic standards. Spending large amounts on refurbishment of unsuitable buildings is not a cost-effective way of dealing with this problem when the alternative is to spend similar amounts on purpose-built, superior and far more suitable educational accommodation. It is clear, therefore, that the upkeep and rental costs of a large number of buildings at different locations around the city makes little sense.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, very few of the buildings currently in use at DIT are purpose-built for educational use. From the outset they were lacking in suitability to some extent or other, and it is good common sense to centralise the functions of DIT at one location, utilising the best available design to achieve the best possible educational and social results.</P>
      <P>The role of education in our society is fundamental, and the contribution that education at all levels has made to our society cannot be under <Col N="1060"/>estimated. Education is a lifelong process that benefits the individual and society in equal measure but we must recognise the importance of education in terms of our continued economic development and reward, and the importance of achieving high results. The recent OECD report I referred to earlier recognises that Irish third level educational institutes do not compete nationally with each other but internationally, and the provision of a modern building complex at Grangegorman will provide DIT with the best possible platform upon which to grow and develop for the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, a campus that meets 21st century requirements can be an attractive destination for research and development finance, both nationally and internationally. This is a unique and possibly last opportunity for Dublin to develop a large-scale third level campus in the city within our lifetime. That is an important point to bear in mind and is the reason it is important we get this right.</P>
      <P>We should also note that a large amount of the costs of developing the educational facilities at Grangegorman can be met by liquidating the current asset properties held by DIT. The sale of major buildings, such as those held at locations like Aungier Street and Bolton Street, could release up to &euro;350 million, while savings on rental income could approximate &euro;4.3 million per annum. Taking these savings into account, and factoring in private and commercially generated funding, DIT estimates that 76% of the total cost of developing the educational facilities at Grangegorman can be met without any burden to the Exchequer. In monetary terms, 76% of costs equals &euro;652 million. There is a good opportunity to get value for money out of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman development will also incorporate upgraded facilities for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The opportunities posed by the incorporation of key educational and health facilities on the one site are considerable. Already, DIT, the ERHA and the Northern Area Health Board have a joint working group and are exploring further how to build greater levels of integration in the new facilities.</P>
      <P>DIT already has a significant provision in health and health related programmes such as clinical and hospital measurement, forensic science, pharmaceutical technology, early child care studies, nutrition, environmental risk management and other similar areas. A number of DIT courses, such as optometry and clinical measurement, rely on direct patient involvement and are dependent on a broad patient base. The Grangegorman development offers the opportunity to integrate courses of this type with direct patient access on the same site, which could be of much benefit to the DIT student and on-site patient. It will be a novel development in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>This type of synergy and developmental innovation could be considerably expanded beyond the courses that are currently offered at DIT. <Col N="1061"/>When the Grangegorman development is progressed, integrated research centres could be established. These centres, concentrating on issues such as nutrition, obesity, disability, care for older people, parenting and child care, could jointly draw on the experience and expertise available at both DIT and the ERHA. Furthermore, promoting an integrated development at Grangegorman could lead to cost savings through a reduction in the duplication of services. Many of the facilities DIT will have to provide at the Grangegorman development could also be of interest to the ERHA and the NAHB. The health authorities should also have access to science laboratories, design workshops and library and training facilities. This could supplement or replace such a requirement within the health authorities, thereby saving a duplication of resources.</P>
      <P>However, I have concerns about the composition of the Grangegorman Development Agency as outlined in the legislation. Under section 16, it is stipulated that the agency shall have 11 members. Section 16(6) provides that the ordinary members of the agency shall include one person nominated by the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology and one person nominated by the city manager of Dublin City Council, in addition to two persons nominated by the Minister for Health and Children. I am concerned at the weighting of members in the agency. Of a total of 11 members, only one will be from DIT. Given that the development of the educational facilities at the Grangegorman site is projected to cost &euro;850 million, more than 90% of the total site development costs, the agency representation given to DIT is deeply inadequate. I will table amendments on this aspect of the legislation on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister to reconsider the provision.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill should signal the start of a bright future for DIT in the 21st century. However, we should not be blind to the considerable funding difficulties that will continue to face DIT and all other institutes of technology and universities in the State. The recent OECD report on third level education policy noted that Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the education system is lower than the OECD average. In public expenditure, it ranks only 25th out of 30 OECD countries. Between 1995 and 2000 public expenditure declined from 4.7% to 4.1%. Worryingly, expenditure per student in tertiary education in Ireland is below the OECD average, with Ireland ranked 14th out of 26 countries. Irish expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gross domestic product is well below EU and OECD averages.</P>
      <P>We can congratulate DIT on offering 45% of its degree programmes in the science and technology sector but we need to do more. We must ensure consistency in third level funding, particularly in the PRTLI programme, and find innovative ways for our third level institutions to access private funding in addition to, not instead of, <Col N="1062"/>what is already available to them from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The proportion of mature students entering higher education is also extremely low and great disparities exist in the third level participation of students from families of different socio-economic backgrounds. This is particularly relevant to the area in which the Grangegorman site is located, Dublin inner city. The DIT has some good and innovative programmes to address this. However, more could be done. More could also be done by the Department. I hope the development of this site will be an opportunity to offer more to people from these backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Trends in the third level sector all point to the increased importance of promoting enterprise, fostering research in our universities and institutes of technology and facilitating co-operation between third level institutions. The third level sector must be enabled to respond innovatively to change and to be strategic in planning for the future. Providing our educational institutions with the facilities they require to meet the considerable challenges that are signalled in the OECD report will be critical for their future success.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the reaction of the communities in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city to this development has been so positive. I spoke to my Fine Gael colleague, Councillor Paschal Donohue, about this Bill and he confirms the positive reaction of people in the locality. They see this as a unique opportunity for them to participate and to see their area rejuvenated. I agree with the Minister that consultation is a key concern for local communities. Maintaining a good communication strategy between the development agency and the people in the area is important, as is the issue of the multi-use model for the facility that will eventually be located in Grangegorman and ensuring that local people can avail of and use the facilities.</P>
      <P>Of particular importance is the fact that DIT will at last be able to offer students on-campus accommodation. This is a vital facility for a third level institution, particularly one located in the capital city, in view of the pressures that already exist on accommodation. This is something that has to happen in third level institutions. A college that completely closes down overnight cannot offer the full third level experience that other institutions can. The best comparison that can be made is between DIT and Trinity College. Trinity College is another city based third level institution and at present it can accommodate 1,800 students. The students are not all in the heart of the city. They live in other areas but they are in residential student accommodation. The DIT cannot offer any such accommodation at present, but it hopes to be able to develop 2,000 campus accommodation places.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the integration of residential and day care facilities not only for the young but also for the elderly and the intellectually impaired. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity <Col N="1063"/>to visit the new public private partnership built school in Dunmanway in west Cork. The principal pointed out that there is a special needs unit within the school, as the Minister is probably aware. One or two of the more troublesome students in the mainstream school go to the special needs unit at lunch time and spend a great deal of time working with the students with special needs. They have obviously found their niche. Perhaps school work is not for them but they have found something at which they are good. The fact that such facilities will be on the campus and that there will be integration for the intellectually impaired and the elderly will be a unique opportunity for students and it should be warmly welcomed.</P>
      <P>The DIT will have, on a single site, students&rsquo; social, cultural, recreational, sporting and pitch facilities. That is almost as important a part of third level education as the courses students choose. It is something we should consider for primary, post-primary and third level sectors to ensure it becomes a way of life and not just an optional extra. Unless such facilities are available and easy to reach, people will not use them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposed development at Grangegorman. It will be essential for the continued success of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill. It is probably a benefit for the Minister that the first Bill she brings to the House is one we wholeheartedly support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Long may it last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is long awaited. I and my colleagues, Deputy Burton and Deputy Costello, in whose constituency the development is located, have been asking the Taoiseach about it on the Order of Business for a long time. I am glad it has been published and that it is being debated on Second Stage today.</P>
      <P>Grangegorman will provide an appropriate campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is the largest educational institution in the country. It is currently located in 39 different buildings around the capital city. The development will also provide services for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board. While it awaits the development on the 73 acre site the Dublin Institute of Technology is paying approximately &euro;4.1 million per annum in rent, and many of its students and staff are working in inadequate, overcrowded conditions. When the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science had an opportunity to visit the site recently, it was explained to us how bad the conditions are in some of the buildings. There are also health and safety concerns.</P>
      <P>It would cost more for DIT to stay in the various sites around the city than to develop the new <Col N="1064"/>site because of the need to update so many of the buildings it currently uses.</P>
      <P>It will obviously be a win-win situation for everybody if this site is developed as soon as possible. Despite the extraordinary difficulties caused by operating in such inadequate and widely scattered buildings, the Dublin Institute of Technology has managed to develop an excellent reputation and to deliver a wide variety of educational opportunities to more than 20,000 students, some part-time, some full-time, and ranging in age from seven to 70. The seven year olds are some of the music students and the 70 year olds are a considerable number of mature and older students, many of them part-time, which DIT facilitates.</P>
      <P>This is one of the good points about DIT. It is a unique institution which provides and responds to a wide variety of needs in our economy and society, particularly in the city of Dublin although the students come from many locations. I speak as a parent of a former student of DIT. My daughter studied human nutrition and dietetics at DIT, so I have personal experience of the college.</P>
      <P>I was concerned by the Minister&rsquo;s reference to financing and I raise this issue in the context of the need to proceed as quickly as possible with this development and the importance for DIT in particular of getting onto the campus as quickly as possible. The Minister referred to the institute developing on a phased basis. This is accepted by DIT, which will move gradually and gradually sell valuable premises to help finance the project. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">While it was anticipated that the initial phase would be financed through my Department with Exchequer funds, the agency will now examine the most advantageous funding options available in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I do not have any objections <i>per se</i> to the NDFA being involved and think it important the agency is involved in such a major project. However, I am concerned with the possibility that public private partnership funding and not Exchequer funding might be the funding mechanism considered. Given the current problems in regard to the Cork School of Music in particular and the difficulties Jarvis plc has encountered, we do not want this project delayed. I am not happy with the PPP model. While I am not sure PPP is the intention, I am concerned with this aspect of the proposal and ask the Minister to respond on this question.</P>
      <P>Exchequer funds are appropriate in this situation, particularly as more than 70% of the funding will come from DIT itself in terms of off-loading valuable buildings and other contributions it will be able to access through its contacts with industry, etc. The Exchequer should invest an appropriate amount, particularly as it will save on the cost of updating the existing buildings. I am concerned that the raising of this matter by Minister could delay the project. It is essential it is <Col N="1065"/>not delayed because DIT needs an appropriate campus. It is also in the interest of the surrounding community that the campus is developed as quickly as possible as there are obviously significant advantages for the local community.</P>
      <P>Today is the 150th anniversary of the founding of UCD and, in that context, it is interesting we are discussing a new campus in the heart of Dublin. Deputy Enright referred to Trinity College and the Minister referred to DCU. While all the educational institutions in our capital city are complementary, this institution has the capacity to bring about much synergy, a concept referred to often by the new DIT director, Professor Brian Norton, when we visited the campus. This synergy would operate across the different disciplines in DIT but would also operate in regard to the health authority and the local community, both business and residential. It is a landmark day in the history of Dublin in that while we are celebrating UCD&rsquo;s 150th anniversary, we are also in the process of setting up a new campus close to the inner city.</P>
      <P>The statistics with regard to the participation of those from disadvantaged communities in Dublin are quite stark in comparison to other parts of the country and other parts of Dublin. There is high participation at third level from some of the more affluent areas of Dublin and the national average is over 50%, whereas the participation rate for Dublin&rsquo;s inner city is approximately 19%. Therefore, it is important that this development attracts more students from its surrounding area to participate in third level education. The flexible approach of DIT should encourage this as study there does not have to be full-time at undergraduate level. Other options are available, including night courses and working with industry to upskill workers.</P>
      <P>The college has great potential with regard to the surrounding community and it is important this is recognised and developed. In saying this, I acknowledge the achievements of DIT on the issue of access. It has what are known as DIT-community links, including the lifelong educational access programme through which 250 disadvantaged students receive ongoing support, the Dublin inner city schools computerisation programme, the pathways through education programme which provides intervention for 12 to 15 year olds, the St. Joseph&rsquo;s wind band in Ballymun, supervised study in various DIT sites and the digital community programme. These are examples of what DIT is already doing in this area but there is significant scope for development with regard to the surrounding community.</P>
      <P>There is also scope for development in regard to interacting with the business community and with the development of new commercial opportunities and research and development, to which Deputy Enright referred in detail. The DIT made a submission on the industrial and commercial aspect to Dublin City Council in the context of the development plan. It referred to three innovation hubs and a range of proposals in regard to <Col N="1066"/>working with the community in the context of, for example, knowledge-based companies, information and communications technology &mdash; ICT, library facilities, meeting facilities, campus facilities and other areas such as restaurants, shops, etc., common social space and regular events dedicated to facilitating networking between students and industrialists. All this is very positive. In the wider context of the OECD recommendations on research and development and interaction with industry, DIT has much experience but also much potential.</P>
      <P>Section 11 refers to the development of commercial activities. I presume this means the kind of issue to which I have just referred, where there is interaction between DIT and surrounding business and industry. Will the Minister clarify that it does not mean selling off parts of the site for separate industrial or commercial development or, in other words, that it is not about providing cheap sites to those who wish to develop commercial businesses? I hope this would not be the case and that industrial and commercial development would be integrated development, connected to the progress being made in DIT and to what is of advantage to the local community.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>When we visited the college, one of the issues raised was in regard to apprenticeship education, a matter about which I feel strongly. Apprenticeship education has not been developed and given the value it should have been given. The building industry is important to our economy. We need plumbers, mechanics, painters and bricklayers as much as we need IT workers. That sector is not given priority. For example, to become an apprentice, one needs sponsorship from a company to get through college. In some ways there are benefits to this but it also makes it difficult to get into an apprenticeship. I welcome the value the Dublin Institute of Technology gives to apprenticeship education as it has 3,500 enrolled per annum. This area needs more focus in national priority. These students should not be seen as some second class group in comparison to those doing other courses identified as important to the economy.</P>
      <P>The part-time courses provided by the Dublin Institute of Technology in Cathal Brugha Street for the catering industry are important. Their evening courses, including ones on cake-icing, give many opportunities to catering industry workers to upskill. The interaction, referred to by the Minister for Education and Science and Deputy Enright between the health and education sectors, is provided for on the Grangegorman site and in the Dublin Institute of Technology courses such as dietetics, nutrition and optometry. The Dublin Institute of Technology discussed the shortage of optometrists with the health boards to provide the opportunity for both to directly interact on the site. This will also provide real spin-offs for both the health authorities and the educational institution. Upskilling of workers is important but it can be difficult for <Col N="1067"/>workers to get the opportunities to do so while at work. It is important for the Dublin Institute of Technology to work with industry in providing such opportunities.</P>
      <P>The often mentioned Lisbon agenda has identified the need for 300,000 extra skilled workers by 2015. This type of flexibility will be important in providing for the economy. It is also important to provide for society, which is why health-related courses are important. Child care and music are two fields that the Dublin Institute of Technology has addressed. There are problems regarding the teaching of music in various places, most notably the Waterford Institute of Technology. There is a need for the Minister to review the teaching of music and its importance. Teaching arrangements for it are haphazard and the Dublin Institute of Technology had problems in the area too.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointing aspects of the OECD report on education is that it focused on the economy without addressing our broader expectations of how third level institutions can cater for society&rsquo;s needs, whether through providing doctors, nurses, optometrists or child care workers. It is important that in emphasising the needs of the economy these workers are included. Great emphasis is placed on research and development and industry. One positive aspect of the Dublin Institute of Technology is that it crosses these needs. Professor Kathleen Lynch pointed out that the OECD report ignored its brief to address societal as well as industrial needs. I am concerned that the proposals for interaction between third level institutions and industry should be on the basis of independent thought. There is a need for third level institutions to foster that and good teaching. They should not be beholden to the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>The directors of third level institutions pointed out that if they receive funding from the industrial sector, they may lose public funding. They must be given the assurance that this will not be the case. The Dublin Institute of Technology model is an organic one where it works closely and interactively with industry. I do not want to see a model where big corporations fund a particular school in a university or institute of technology and, therefore, expect the research carried out there to be good to them. In some models, particularly in the US, the research is sometimes more for the corporation than independent thought. Independent thought is what is needed from our universities. It is apt on this day of UCD&rsquo;s anniversary to remember Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s <i>The Idea of a University</i>. The original concepts of a university and an institute of technology must be retained. While I acknowledge interaction with industry is important and it benefits the institutions and the economy as a whole, we must ensure that the baby is not thrown out with the bath water.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned at suggestions of going down the private route for some of our universities. With annual fees of $40,000 for Harvard and <Col N="1068"/>Yale universities, Ireland cannot go down that road. We have a proud record in education at all levels and we must keep our European identity in that regard. There are plenty of models in Europe of successful educational systems at all levels, funded by public money. Last year&rsquo;s third level cutbacks of approximately 10% hurt the sector. The OECD report implies that this funding will have to come from the private sector. It also suggests the introduction of tuition fees to which the Labour Party is emphatically opposed. The Government claims it is not on the agenda for its lifetime. However, it is important that all educational sectors are properly funded. In our expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP, Ireland is below the OECD and the EU average. We should not be talking of robbing the third level sector to provide for others. While money is needed for pre-school, primary and second level education, it is important that it is also provided for the third level sector.</P>
      <P>Investment in education has been a catalyst for the growth of what is described as the Celtic tiger. The former Ministers for Education, Mr. Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, introduced free access to second and third level respectively during more difficult economic times. We are reaping the benefits of their decisions and statistics show an increased participation in third level education. However, penny-pinching must be avoided when the State is wealthy with the resources to provide for education. I hope the Minister&rsquo;s aim will be to fight for a greater education budget right across the board rather than taking from once sector to provide for another.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Enright on the issue of representation and section 16 and I will table amendments on it. The staff in the Dublin Institute of Technology need representation on the agency. The Minister received a letter from the Teachers Union of Ireland suggesting that under social partnership, representation for the Dublin Institute of Technology staff should be included in the agency. I support the union in pointing out there is already provision in the Dublin Institute of Technology Act for staff representation. The local community also needs to be consulted. I accept the Bill provides for consultation with the local community. We have received correspondence from representatives of the local community suggesting amendments to promote greater local participation in the agency&rsquo;s operation. I do not know if the Minister received such correspondence but there needs to be discussion as to whether the provisions of the Bill adequately provide for local community participation. I urge her to look at this specific point.</P>
      <P>It is important to expedite the legislation through the Houses without moving too fast. The Bill requires proper scrutiny on all Stages in this House and in the Seanad. However, there should be no undue delay. I hope the various Stages will be scheduled through the Houses of the Oireachtas in a timely fashion. It is most <Col N="1069"/>important for DIT that it has the opportunity to move to its new campus as quickly as possible. We will see great benefits, not just for DIT but for the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>When the Joint Committee on Education and Science visited the site, Deputy Gogarty expressed concern about transportation. Other issues of concern are, access to sporting facilities for the local community, which I understand is included, and the general interaction of the local community with the campus. I support what Deputy Enright said about on-campus facilities and on-site student accommodation. It is important that there is interaction in that regard between the students and the local community. Sometimes there can be animosity between students and local communities if things are not managed properly and the local community does not consider it has some ownership of and access to what is available on campus. It is important to get that right, otherwise it will be to the detriment of both the local community and the student population.</P>
      <P>I support the proposals we received from the Dublin Institute of Technology when we visited the site and those contained in the Bill. I am pleased to support the legislation. We will table some amendments but they will not be major ones. They are mainly concerned with the composition of the agency. I hope we will be able to move as speedily as possible to establish this very exciting campus in an important part of Dublin city for the benefit of Dublin and the nation as a whole. DIT has been a unique institution and has the capacity to be even more pro-active in future.</P>

	<P>I have been reminded it is the 150th anniversary of the founding of UCD. Given that all the education spokespersons are present in the House, it is appropriate that we would congratulate UCD on 150 years of education here, and the contribution that its learning and its graduates continue to make not only to Irish society but to the world. We are very proud of it on its 150th anniversary. It is a wonderful celebration for the university. Newman&rsquo;s idea of a university has developed and grown during that time.</P>

	<P>Given that the Technical Group has to split its time, I will not go into a long preamble about the nature of the Bill, the size of the campus, the number of students attending it, etc. This has already been outlined most eloquently by the Minister, Deputy Enright and to a lesser extent, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>
      <P>I may be slightly tongue in cheek in saying to the Minister that in footballing terms she has been given an away fixture against one of the footballing minnows. This is a Bill for which the Minister is likely to get widespread support from all sides of the House. Any criticism in the form of Committee Stage amendments will be tabled purely to try to enhance the legislation and not for any party political purposes. The Minister is eminently capable of being Minister for Education and Science and she will receive more flak at a later stage, so if I am not giving her any flak now she should be prepared for it later on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>No one would deny the Bill is a hugely positive development for education. Bringing the disparate elements of DIT to one campus can only be a positive thing. I am a former journalism student of the College of Commerce, Rathmines, which is now DIT Aungier Street. I must admit it was a bit of a kip, which is a view I am sure DIT students in other locations would share. While the facilities often left much to be desired, that is not to infer any criticism of the excellent teaching ability of staff or the quality of student life. A great opportunity is presented to students going to the new campus and I wish them well in it.</P>
      <P>Specific amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage. Section 8 deals with the functions of the agency. These include the establishment of a planning scheme, the need to consult regarding public transport and the communications strategy. I hope there is a way to include in the legislation that the planning scheme should incorporate some element of a carrot and stick approach to public transportation. As Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan stated, when the Joint Committee on Education and Science visited the proposed campus, I compared it to the plan for Adamstown in Lucan where it is intended to construct a town the size of Drogheda adjacent to the fastest growing town in Ireland. It is not an island and neither will this campus be an island. It will not be totally self-sufficient and will need to integrate properly with the existing community.</P>
      <P>Transportation links to Grangegorman will need to be provided in addition to an enhanced local service. In the case of Adamstown, while An Bord Plean&aacute;la did its best to put checks and balances into the plan I would argue that its details are still very loose. There is no guarantee that four-tracking of the railway will be provided on time, whereas a developer can proceed with <Col N="1071"/>X number of houses. The situations are slightly different but I find the comparisons helpful. If conditions were drawn up at the outset as part of a planning scheme it would put pressure on agencies such as Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to come up with the goods. They would rise to the occasion if they were seen to be a cause of delaying the project because the proper links had not been put in place. If one is to wait for the links to come it is usually demand-driven and while a half-full campus still needs public transport the agencies might say there is no economic demand, and that the campus needs to be full which may take years after it is opened. I propose that conditions should be laid down regarding the scale and timescale of the development and these should be tied up with public transport. That would be a risky approach but it would be very welcome.</P>
      <P>If the Government has the willpower, it will push the transportation bodies to provide them beside the development.</P>
      <P>When I see the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; I almost have a hernia because when I was a councillor, consultation meant telling local residents what the council was going to do then going ahead and doing it anyway. While residents&rsquo; groups can have a &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; attitude, they can often make valuable and worthwhile contributions and should not be overlooked. I welcome the reference to a communications strategy in section 8 but that must be a two-way process and any valid input from residents&rsquo; groups must be taken on board and be seen to be taken on board. It should not be a matter of making a promise or taking the residents&rsquo; points on board without letting them know how the project moves from A to Z. They must be involved at every step of the procedure and the meetings outlined in other parts of the proposed legislation should be frequent, especially for residents&rsquo; groups.</P>
      <P>In my proposed preamble to section 8 I included some of the strategic plan but I am concerned about Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s reference to commercial activities. I presume this refers to the incubator businesses in which the Dublin Institute of Technology is already involved. I am also concerned about private commercial interests getting involved unless this is expressly to facilitate the academic research conducted on the campus. In the US, for example, there are developments that are closely tied to a commercial entity.</P>
      <P>Partialism is another concern. This occurs in multinational companies that set up research and development facilities here which are part of facilities in India, the Far East and the United States. One can never gain a competency and have one&rsquo;s expertise developed and nurtured in an Irish context. One is simply part of the company rather than contributing to something wider. According to the OECD report, we are significantly lacking in indigenous research and development, for example, in the prime area of <Col N="1072"/>renewable energy. We have a strategic interest in ensuring we can cater for energy supplies rather than depending totally on oil which is becoming scarce and will increase in price. However, this is not the time to discuss that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about membership of the agency in section 16. The Dublin Institute of Technology must have more than one representative on the board. Otherwise, the entities brought together will have no validity and it will be more a commercial development than a college. Even for the optics ensuring more representation by increasing the number of members or changing the membership would validate it and inspire faith in the educational institutions that the Dublin Institute of Technology is a key stakeholder in the process. The same applies to the two nominees of the Minister for Health and Children. It is not specified from where they should come. That is at the discretion of the Minister. In terms of the operation already at Grangegorman, St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, the contribution made by the staff and the expertise already in place should be represented and that should be specified among the 11 or more members. The same applies to a resident representing the wider area. He or she should be on a board of possibly 14 members to legitimise the sense of stakeholdership. Too often very good legislation and plans go awry because of lack of communication.</P>
      <P>While I have no major problems about this proposal as long as it achieves a sustainable integrated campus that will involve the community and benefit our academic research and the health care system, for example in optometry, I ask that the consultation process be more transparent than the one we have already seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister&rsquo;s speech was very helpful in that many people do not understand how this site and the project will develop. The detail in the Minister&rsquo;s speech will help quell some of the concerns in the community. People in the area are concerned about the impact the development on such a large site will have on their lives and the community. Most of those to whom I have spoken want this to proceed. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that 39 buildings on 30 sites is not economical. Many of those attending courses in those buildings would say there is a sense of family in them and some people fear that by moving to a larger site they would lose some of that personal contact. However, it is the way forward and everyone who looks at the proposal would accept that is the case if the investment is in place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gogarty mentioned transport for 20,000 students travelling to the site. One major concern referred to in the Bill is that transport must be up to standard. The transport in the area is inadequate but there is a railway line nearby which could possibly be developed for this purpose. The Minister says it is only walking distance from the main street but for those attending the various buildings around the city, transport in <Col N="1073"/>Dublin is difficult and it would not be as accessible as the Minister outlines. All her arguments for amalgamating the Dublin Institute of Technology make sense but accessibility is central. Many students will travel to the college.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell talked about housing. We all accept there is a housing crisis in Dublin. There should be on-site student accommodation. In my area the Institute of Technology Tallaght is in phase seven which involves possibly building accommodation on the site. This creates serious difficulty for students and is one of the main topics people raise. It does not seem to be included on this site but a campus of this size needs this facility. Deputy Enright talked about on-site facilities but part of those must be accommodation. Just because the campus is in Dublin does not mean there is no housing crisis. Accommodation must be part of that campus.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked of selling off the sites. The institutes of technology do not enjoy a level playing field.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002, the question of costs is solely a matter for a tribunal. The Acts allow a tribunal to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it to be paid, if it is of the opinion that there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters. Crucially, when determining whether costs should be paid, a tribunal may take into account whether a person has failed to co-operate with it, or has knowingly given false or misleading information to it. This constitutes a powerful incentive for witnesses to co-operate fully with tribunals, apart <Col N="1074"/>altogether from the other potential legal consequences of non-co-operation.</P>
        <P>The question of costs for the first module of its terms of reference has already been decided by the Morris tribunal. Its <i>modus operandi</i> has been to complete the first module and then deal with the costs of that module. In deciding on these costs, the chairman made deductions in some cases and totally rejected other applications, where he was of the opinion that persons had deliberately lied or otherwise had hindered the tribunal in its efforts to uncover the truth. This power is not, therefore, some remote academic possibility, but a real and significant factor in the workings of the tribunal. It is also of relevance to note that costs are being settled on a modular basis which, when added to the urgency which the tribunal is bringing to its work, means that co-operative witnesses can expect to receive their costs much more quickly than might otherwise be the case.</P>
        <P>The intention of the Oireachtas, in leaving the task of deciding costs to tribunals and in providing tribunals with the power to withhold costs from non-co-operative witnesses, was to ensure the effectiveness of tribunals. Therefore, I do not believe that it would be sensible for the State to dilute this power in any way, for example through the direct payment by the State of the costs of any third party. That has been my clear and consistent position on the payment of costs which I have maintained in the face of High Court challenges from a number of parties to the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P>Deputies should consider the significant implications that any change in this position could have for the effectiveness of the Morris tribunal. I do not believe that there is any analogous precedent for what is proposed here.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information</P>
        <P>While we are discussing one group of persons, a family, there must be a generally applicable principle on costs and not just an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for any individual. Any payment by the State of one party&rsquo;s costs would immediately raise the question as to why the State should not pay the costs of other third parties, or indeed every third party. Selective payments would be open to the interpretation that the State is effectively coming to its own view, in advance of the tribunal&rsquo;s findings, on which are the meritorious and which the unmeritorious parties before it.</P>
        <P>At various times since September, the family in question complained to the chairman of the tribunal of their inability to continue to have legal representation for financial reasons, and the chairman recently made efforts to resolve the issue. I understand from a statement made by the chairman at the tribunal, that some progress was made by him in trying to secure the services of counsel who would act on behalf of the family. This was not acceptable to the family and the chairman decided not to continue with his efforts in this regard. Neither I nor my Department had <Col N="1075"/>any involvement in this initiative by the chairman.</P>
        <P>Finally, I take this opportunity to say again what was said last week in the Adjournment debate on this subject. The forum now exists for the truth about events in Donegal to be exposed. I know the chairman and his legal team are pursuing the truth with vigour. The Morris tribunal has already demonstrated its effectiveness in doing so, and the Government has also shown its determination to take action on the findings of the tribunal. I call on everyone involved to participate in what is transparently a fair and effective process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider this issue from the point of view of fairness and justice and from the point of view of the effectiveness of the tribunal. There would be no Morris tribunal only for the McBrearty family. It is surely a basic principle of fairness and justice that a principal party involved in a tribunal should be entitled to be represented by counsel and solicitors of its own choice. I ask the Minister to accept that basic principle in a context where he is represented and his lawyers are paid, the Garda Commissioner is represented and his lawyers paid, and so on. That is surely a basic situation and needs to be looked at.</P>
        <P>It is quite clear that the Morris tribunal has done a good job so far, produced an excellent report, but the judge is now into a number of modules where the McBrearty&rsquo;s are absolutely essential. They want to give evidence and they want to be there to co-operate. The judge wants to see them represented. He himself made a gesture in this regard. Whereas he made it clear that he recognised that they should be represented, they want to be represented by their own lawyers, which is not an unreasonable request. There are precedents for this and I want to quote a number of them if I have time. There are precedents regarding the commission to inquire into child abuse, where the Minister for Education and Science established a scheme for payment of expenses. There is a precedent regarding the Lindsay tribunal, where the Minister stepped in and paid for the legal representation of the haemophiliac society that was before it. There is a precedent in Northern Ireland regarding the tribunal on Bloody Sunday. There is an old precedent regarding families appearing before the tribunal on the Stardust tragedy.</P>
        <P>Justice requires that the family be represented. The effectiveness and efficiency of the tribunal requires that they be represented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of injustice being done here. I stand by the tribunal and its capacity to do its work in an effective way. One of the powers that it has as its disposal is to grant or withhold any portion or cost to a witness who does or does not co-operate with the tribunal or who misleads the tribunal in any way. I do not <Col N="1076"/>propose to pre-judge the outcome of the tribunal in the manner in which the Deputy&rsquo;s question implies. Let me remind him that there are other parties to this tribunal. The family of Richie Barron is entitled to participate in these proceedings. The Deputy implied that there would be no tribunal if it were not for the McBrearty family, neither would there be a tribunal if it were not for the terrible tragedy that befell Richie Barron&rsquo;s family. I am not in a position to say that one witness before this tribunal is to be treated in a substantially different way from other witnesses. In the High Court I resisted efforts made to force me to pay moneys on an ongoing basis to witnesses who were later denied their costs as they did not co-operate with the tribunal and they deliberately mislead the tribunal. I do not propose to depart from that.</P>
        <P>The McBrearty family is entitled to be represented by whoever they wish. The chairman of the tribunal, without any input from me in the matter, attempted to provide them with lawyers who would act in the conventional way in the expectation that their costs would be paid after the relevant module in question was completed. For some reason, the lawyers in question were not willing or able to do that. That is something which the tribunal has done its best to remedy, but it cannot show partisanship to one witness when there clearly are other witnesses who sought and were denied exactly the same facility that the Deputy is canvassing for the McBrearty family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The judge specifically indicated that they should be represented. The only point of difference here is whether they should be represented by counsel of their own choice. There are precedents and if the Minister has the political will, it can be done. The Minister is involved in a legal case and he wants to have his own lawyers and that is not unreasonable. These people are before the tribunal. They have dealt with their own lawyers during the past seven years. Taking everything into account, it is surely not unreasonable that they should be able to continue and be represented in a situation where the judge clearly wants to have them represented before the tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P>So have members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have since been denied their costs. Some of these people attempted to have their costs guaranteed in advance by bringing actions in the High Court and others made threats along those lines. The tribunal has not suggested to me that I should pay the McBreartys&rsquo; costs in advance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an historic time for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This Government started its second term in June 2002 with a firm commitment to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. The Government recently approved my proposal to achieve the increase, involving an intake of almost 1,100 recruits per annum over the next three years. The logistics of such a major recruitment and training campaign are formidable, but the challenges can and will be overcome with the commitment of Garda management and staff and with my full support.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to increase Garda numbers to 14,000 will lead to additional accommodation requirements at the Garda College in Templemore. A number of key developments will take place to facilitate the recruitment drive. The Garda Commissioner will temporarily move most in-service training from the college to a new location, thereby enabling the college to concentrate mainly on training new recruits. The Office of Public Works advertised in the national press on 22 October last for expressions of interest in the provision of new accommodation. It is envisaged that the outsourced facility will provide accommodation for up to 100 garda&iacute; with classroom, lecture and other necessary facilities. It is envisaged that the facility will be completed in time for the increased intake in February 2006.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the college will be substantially increased next year to provide for central administration accommodation, a new library and gym facilities and to free up existing space for classroom use. Work will be undertaken to relocate the tactical training facility, which will be displaced by the new facility. The Garda Com<Col N="1078"/>missioner proposes to rebalance phase 3 of Garda training. The last four weeks of phase 3, which involves spending 16 weeks in the college, will now be spent in Garda stations.</P>
        <P>The recruitment campaign will start shortly. The Garda Commissioner will place advertisements in the national newspapers in the coming weeks inviting applications to join the force and record numbers of recruits will be taken on. Approximately 274 recruits will be taken into the college in each quarter, over the next three years, amounting to almost 1,100 recruits each year. If one takes projected retirements into account, the Garda will have a combined organisational strength of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as 2006.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information</P>
        <P>I intend to bring the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal to increase the maximum age of entry from 26 to 35 to the Government for its approval. This significant change will extend to many more people the opportunity of a career in the Garda and will increase the pool of talent available to the force. After I have engaged in the necessary consultations with the Garda representative associations, I intend to ensure that the new maximum age will apply to the next Garda recruitment competition to be advertised in the coming weeks, subject to the approval of the Government. I am confident the ambitious targets will be met with the support of all involved, without any diminution of the highest standards of training maintained by the college down the years. The necessary resources for the Garda budget are being addressed in the context of the 2005 Estimates process, which will apply to succeeding years and also applies to the largely one-off OPW capital costs. It is projected that the funding required in the Garda budget will initially be relatively small &mdash; approximately &euro;11 million in 2005 &mdash; but it will rise progressively to &euro;124 million by 2009.</P>
        <P>It is projected that 451 garda&iacute; will leave the force in 2005, 440 will leave in 2006, 514 will leave in 2007 and 627 will leave in 2008. The record recruitment drive which is about to commence will place a significant increase in Garda resources at the disposal of the Commissioner, who will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage the resources. The additional resources will be targeted at areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government, which specifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences. It will also be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to increase significantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line operational, high-visibility policing and will have a real impact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s comment that this is &ldquo;an historic time for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; is fairly laughable. He has restated the commitment in the programme for Government for the umpteenth time in the past two and a half years, but no steps have been taken to ensure that it is attainable. The Minister has announced a plethora of proposals that will take a considerable amount of time to implement. If one examines the existing level of recruitment, one will see that 850 garda&iacute; qualified between June 2002 and July 2004 and 883 garda&iacute; resigned or retired in that time. We are not making any progress.</P>
        <P>I wish to consider the logistics of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. He sought expressions of interest at the end of last month, but he has not yet received any firm tenders. Nobody has been contracted to build the new four-storey structure at Templemore. Can the Minister give us some information on the planning process that will be necessary before the new building can be constructed and fitted out? The Minister has admitted that the first phase of the recruitment will take place in February 2006. He said he will commence the recruitment process before Christmas. I cannot envisage how the Minister will be able to fulfil the commitment he has made to recruit a further 2,000 garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000 by 2007 or 2008. The Garda authorities have said the best case scenario is that there will be 500 new recruits by 2007. The Minister has announced it again and explained how he proposes to do it, but it cannot be done within the time frame he has specified. I would like to hear something more positive in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy by assuring him that the programme I announced in the Phoenix Park recently will be delivered on time and exactly as I described it. The building in question will be finished in time. Representatives of the Office of Public Works who attended the function in the Phoenix Park assured me that they will build the facility on time. It will be the subject of an accelerated planning process, requiring little more than a notification, because it is being built on the Templemore campus. The recruitment will take place. If the Deputy checks the programme for Government, he will see that the first commitment I made was to the completion of the current expansion of the Garda. The strength of the Garda will increase to 12,200 later this month, as I promised during the first stage of the process. By 2006 there will be well over 14,000 people in uniform, attested and in training, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The recruitment drive will have driven us there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I take with a grain of salt, everything said by the Minister today about the proposed additional 2,000 garda&iacute;, but we will wait and see what happens. Is it appropriate to extend the Garda College at Templemore now? The House has discussed today the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004, which provides for a new campus for six faculties of the Dublin Institute of Technology. Would it not be appropriate to introduce a seventh faculty, in the form of a police academy in an urban setting? Garda trainees could be in contact with their peers at third level at such a location and could do some or all of their training in such a setting. In-service courses could be conducted there. There are adequate recreational and training grounds in the 71 acres of land at Grangegorman. Rather than proceeding with a half-baked plan for a four-storey development at Templemore, which will not be delivered on time, we have an ideal opportunity to plan carefully a long-term solution to the training requirements of the Garda at an urban setting in our capital city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy once again. I will invite him to the open<Col N="1082"/>ing of this four-storey building, and I guarantee him now that they will have it on the date that they specify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We would invite the Minister from the Government side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They can come and see for themselves, feel it with their own hands and watch the increased intake being dealt with in the newly expanded Templemore. The second thing is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s facilities at Templemore are being improved as a result of this. I am not making some temporary little arrangement but moving out in-service accommodation with a view to accommodating the temporary increase in recruitment necessary to achieve the Government&rsquo;s commitment.</P>
        <P>When it is over, all those buildings will stand to Templemore, which is a premier Garda training institution. The Deputy&rsquo;s question implies that garda&iacute; are isolated in the course of their training outside an urban setting. While I can see that he would like to have another facility built within his own constituency, perhaps I might make this point. Every garda now completes extensive training modules in Dublin and other places away from Templemore as part of training. Many of them follow courses as part of their training, attending institutes of technology and so on during that time. I can well imagine that the Deputy and others want to suggest that what I am doing will not be achieved. However, it will happen.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>if he will consider applying the principle of permanence to underpin Irish immigration policy in order that all immigrants are seen as potentially permanent members of society here and provided with equal rights to Irish persons.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27310/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In answering this question, I must first point out that discussions on immigration are frequently based on the assumption that immigrants are a homogeneous group, all of whom have the same plans or intentions, primarily to stay in Ireland for ever. That is not the case. The majority of people who come through our immigration system are short-term visitors such as tourists or business visitors. Clearly, it would not make sense to talk about such people as potential permanent residents or to subject them to the level of scrutiny which such potential status would require.</P>
        <P>Even among those who seek to enter the State for longer-term purposes, many are by their nature temporary visitors to Ireland. Those include a substantial number of students. The usual situation is that after qualification they return to their country of origin. Many of the workers who come to Ireland through the work permit, working visa and work authorisation schemes plan to do so for a short period. They intend, like many Irish people who choose to work abroad, to spend a short period gaining experience or earning money in their host country before returning to their countries of origin. The view that all those people should be regarded as potential permanent members of society here is simplistic and does not recognise the complex nature of migration decisions.</P>
        <P>A distinction needs to be made between those who come to the State through the many legal channels available and those who come illegally or abuse the asylum system by claiming to suffer from persecution when they do not. A person who enters the State illegally should not be regarded as a potential permanent resident. It is recognised internationally that, to protect the integrity of asylum systems, an applicant who, after a fair and transparent determination process, is found not to be in need of protection should normally be returned to his or her country of origin, as long as that does not involve sending anyone back to persecution.</P>
        <P>I recognise that at present there is no separate status of &ldquo;long-term resident&rdquo; or &ldquo;permanent resident&rdquo; in the Irish Immigration system. I am considering the issue of long-term residence in the context of the proposed immigration and residence Bill which I intend to publish in 2005. It is open to a non-national who meets certain statutory provisions, including a period of residence which can vary from three to five years, to apply for Irish citizenship through the process of naturalisation. In 2003 alone, 3,580 people made such <Col N="1084"/>applications and 3,138 had done so to the end of September 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that immigrants to Ireland are not a homogeneous group, but I suggest that a significant cohort among them wish to make their permanent home in Ireland. Their status is not treated with the maturity that it deserves. In many respects, Irish immigration policy allows immigrants into the country on sufferance. We need a strong and coherent immigration policy. Does the Minister accept that we must examine best practice abroad and bring that into Ireland and that we have been waiting long enough?</P>
        <P>Does he accept that, in many respects, immigrants to Ireland are simply treated as second-class citizens? The status, particularly of those on working visas, is like that of indentured servants. They are like slaves in the southern United States 150 or 200 years ago when they were owned by the cotton kings. It is very difficult for those here on working visas to change their job description without simply going to the employer and pleading with them to have the visa changed. They cannot be promoted because their job description would change. In many respects, they are indentured servants.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that the criteria for habitual residence are being very strictly enforced and that it is quite difficult for many people coming to Ireland to claim benefits under that rule? Perhaps the Minister might examine best practice abroad in immigration. There are examples in Canada, the US and elsewhere that might well be brought into Ireland. Does he accept that the Government must recognise that giving some groups of people in Irish society fewer rights sows the seeds of racism? Does he accept that it allows to thrive the myths about those coming to Ireland? People ask why they are not working, but they are not allowed to do so.</P>
        <P>Surely the Minister must address their status in Irish society. Does he accept that a Minister of State is needed so that a voice might be given to immigrants in Irish society and that the provision of such a junior Minister might allow a focus point to be created for those coming to Ireland? Surely the Minister would accept that a strong and coherent ethical immigration policy is necessary in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I said in my reply that I am preparing an immigration and residence Bill that will deal with such matters and will be published in 2005. I reject as over the top and a wild exaggeration the suggestion that people working in Ireland under the work permits system, whatever its inadequacies, are analogous to slaves owned by the cotton bosses of the southern United States 150 years ago. I reject that fanciful suggestion. I believe that immigration into Ireland for the purpose of working here is not simply something that is inevitable. It is valuable, and this country needs immigrants at the moment. It would not be doing as well either for itself or for <Col N="1085"/>its immigrants if it were not willing to accept migrant workers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In that context, I am not prepared to operate on the basis that I must consider every economic migrant into Ireland a permanent resident. If I go down that road, it would involve putting more obstacles in their way more than anything else. It is much more reasonable to take account of the real diversity of motivations and timeframes that people who migrate to Ireland for economic purposes have. For instance, many nurses come here from the Philippines intent on working for three to five years. Many people come here from eastern Europe intending to work for two or three years and then to rejoin their family after earning a little capital or repatriate their money in the meantime. The notion that I must deal with everyone as if they are going to live here forever is not realistic. However, we can improve residency administration at the moment. It is sometimes difficult for residents if they have to come back repeatedly to get their status validated on an unnecessarily frequent basis. Part of the new legislation and part of the administrative revolution we are planning for immigration and residency in Ireland will involve a much more positive and attractive approach to migrants.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether the 20 year old radio walkie-talkie equipment supplied to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unreliable and totally out of date; the reason the modern Tetra communications system announced five years ago has not been generally rolled out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27313/04]</QRef><Col N="1086"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a pilot digital radio system covering the Dublin north central division and traffic section of Dublin Castle has been completed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Following its successful completion, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prepared a detailed business case for the extension of the system on a nationwide basis and this was submitted to me in January 2004 by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The benefits of digital radio are obvious, including the additional security it provides over the analogue system currently in use. Discussions are in train between officials of my Department, the Garda authorities and the Department of Finance on technical and implementation options. These discussions are now nearing conclusion. There is consensus on the procurement model to be adopted in respect of Garda requirements. Procurement will be based on an outsourced service provision basis and will involve the bulk of the infrastructure being provided by the private sector with detailed service level agreements in place with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The rationale behind this decision is twofold. First, it will minimise the need for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support and maintain the system. This is in line with my overall policy of ensuring that Garda resources are concentrated on operational duties, not on garda&iacute; acting as technicians for radio systems. Second, the approach being adopted should allow participation by the other emergency services in the same network, thus enabling all emergency services to communicate with one another in the context of major emergencies and other shared or joint operations.</P>
        <P>The alternative course open to me was for the Garda to purchase, own, maintain and operate a system involving a huge initial capital outlay, likely to be in excess of &euro;100 million, with all the risks and additional costs inherent in such a major one-off purchase. Regarding timescales for the project, it is estimated that a tender to issue to the marketplace will be finalised in the new year. Tenders will set out indicative timescales which will be incorporated in the contract finalised with the successful bidder.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept it is outrageous that the Garda should be left with 20 year old walkie-talkies when a new system was promised five years ago and not rolled out? Does the Minister therefore agree that when the Taoiseach spoke in this House this morning about the Garda being supplied with the best equipment, he was talking through his hat? The Garda is using unreliable worn-out radios and in many instances garda&iacute; are forced to borrow mobile phones to connect to headquarters. Does the Minister accept that there are problems other than with that sort of equipment, such as with the financing of the Garda PULSE system for example? Last week I discovered that while we have 703 Garda stations, only 181 have been connected to the PULSE system.</P><Col N="1087"/>
        <P>The situation is the same with bullet-proof vests. They are pooled rather than issued individually. A case was discussed earlier this year with regard to speed detection guns. The guns on issue did not comply with the legislation that they should be capable of producing enduring records. Will the Minister accept that a genuine effort is needed to supply the Garda with the best, most modern and up-to-date equipment, that the Government has not made that effort and that the necessary funds must now be made available if we are to move towards making the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the best-equipped police force in the world? Having to use 20 year old equipment puts the Garda back in the days of the Keystone Cops as far as equipment is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not say they are back in the days of the Keystone Cops but back in the days of Fine Gael and Labour in government. That is where they probably still are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>All of this arose in the past seven years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding unruly remarks made earlier by the Deputy, I remind him that while his party was in office, the number of garda&iacute; declined. This Government has put record resources into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>There are record problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been more resourced in terms of numbers and equipment than it is now. Compared with the levels of expenditure on Garda equipment when the Deputy and his party were in office, levels which were pitiful, the Garda is now going from strength to strength and has never been better equipped.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why will the Minister not equip the Garda properly now?</P>

	<P>The Minister should not be going back into history.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy will allow me to finish, I have to provide the Garda with the best possible digital radio system. I also have to give the Irish taxpayer value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither is being supplied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I could have blown over &euro;100 million on a radio phone system and then found that a mistake had been made. I am making the prudent decision to have this service for the Garda outsourced so that it will be of the highest quality and can be changed and improved with time.</P><Col N="1088"/>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe raised other matters such as other equipment, non-lethal weapons and bullet-proof vests. I am delaying nothing. I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that resources will be put in place for any equipment he believes is reasonably necessary for his force of garda&iacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that the only money of consequence which the Minister spent was the &euro;1 million spent either towards the end of last year or earlier this year on maintaining the present obsolete system of 20 year old walkie-talkies which were recently highlighted in a newspaper article as being unreliable and worn out? The same article made it clear that in many instances, garda&iacute; had to use their own mobile phones or borrow equipment from others to keep in touch with their headquarters. Is that not a ridiculous system for the Minister to preside over? Will he agree that he should accept this pressure from the Opposition as being of some assistance to him in getting the necessary funds from the Minister for Finance this time to properly equip the Garda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Deputy ever tabled his parliamentary question, I was addressing this issue. Since I became Minister it has been my intention to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is properly equipped.</P>

	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe may think that his rhetoric on this subject is of assistance to me, but it is not because I have already decided what action to take on this issue and how I would set about it. I am grateful to him for his support for everything I am doing to make the Garda the strongest and best equipped force in the history of the State. I ask him to reflect on the fact that if these walkie-talkies are defective or inadequate, which I agree they are, they were also in poor condition seven years ago when they were 13 years old, and Fine Gael had been in office for five years without doing anything to address the inadequacies.</P>

        <Quest>his views on reports that garda&iacute; are not inspecting US military aircraft or chartered civilian aircraft carrying US troops landing at Shannon Airport or elsewhere in the State; and the steps that are being taken to ensure that no UN conventions are being <Col N="1089"/>breached and no other laws are being broken by passengers on US military or chartered civilian aircraft landing at Shannon Airport or elsewhere in the State.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27529/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 226 and 227 of 27 October 2004, No. 218 of 7 October 2004, No. 125 of 19 February 2004, No. 142 of 3 December 2003 and No. 429 of 30 September 2004, which were answered by my colleagues, the Ministers for Transport and Foreign Affairs, respectively.</P>
        <P>It is not the practice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inspect aircraft unless it has evidence that criminal activity is being committed or suspects that it is. Permission for foreign military aircraft to land in the State is granted by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, pursuant to the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. Permission is normally granted on the basis of a number of policy stipulations, included among which are requirements relating to cargo contents.</P>
        <P>Chartered civilian aircraft are also sometimes required to transport military cargo through the State. Permission for the transport of any such cargo on civilian aircraft must first be obtained from my colleague, the Minister for Transport, who in turn consults the Minister for Foreign Affairs before reaching a decision.</P>
        <P>In the case of US military aircraft and-or chartered civilian aircraft transporting military cargo, the US Embassy submits applications to confirm that the aircraft seeking landing permission will comply with the operative criteria. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is notified in advance of the arrival of all foreign military and chartered civilian aircraft carrying military cargo and of the cargo contents and passenger numbers. I am informed by the Garda authorities that although such aircraft are not routinely inspected, all such flights and military personnel are monitored by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while transiting through the State.</P>
        <P>As regards civilian aircraft generally landing in the State for refuelling or other purposes, there is no requirement under international or Irish law to notify the Department of Transport in advance, although many airlines voluntarily do so. I am aware of recent press reports which claimed that such a civilian registered aircraft may have been carrying military prisoners when in Ireland. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, responded comprehensively to these reports in Question No. 218 on 7 October last, in which he concluded that there is no evidence that this aircraft was being used for any illegal activity on any occasion when it was in Shannon.</P>
        <P>Neither the Government nor I have any information to indicate that military prisoners are being transported through Irish airports. The US authorities have confirmed to our embassy in Washington that they have not been using Irish airports for this purpose and that they would not do so in the future without first seeking the authorisation of the Irish authorities.</P><Col N="1090"/>
        <P>In respect of any aircraft landing in the State, whether it be a military aircraft, a chartered civilian aircraft transporting a military cargo or an ordinary civilian aircraft, I assure the Deputy that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would conduct a full investigation in any case in which a credible complaint of criminal activity &mdash; such as holding somebody in unlawful custody &mdash; is made, to include, where appropriate, an inspection of the aircraft in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government appears to believe the assurances given to it by its US counterpart. In this case, that is not good enough. There is evidence that the Gulfstream aircraft in question, call sign N379P, had been used on a number of occasions to illegally transport al-Qaeda suspects for interrogation abroad and that it regularly travelled through Shannon. No one denies that. The difficulty with the Minister&rsquo;s reply is that evidence is usually discovered after the fact. It is too late for us to investigate the movements of a plane which has reached its home base in America or wherever. The Minister must give an undertaking that garda&iacute; will routinely check these planes when they land in airports in the State. I refer specifically to US military and civilian aircraft.</P>
        <P>Are there so many of these aircraft landing here that Garda resources would be wasted in trying to search them? I do not believe so. International law is being violated on a regular basis in Irish airspace and at Irish airports. Will the Minister give a commitment that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will undertake to check the cargo or personnel on board these planes? That is the only way in which to disprove what I have said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I profoundly disagree with the Deputy. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have better things to do than stand on the apron at Shannon, waiting for flights to land in order to check their cargoes. The people expect garda&iacute; to do other things which would be of greater benefit to the State and its citizens.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda&iacute; never arrest peace protesters, as such. When they are monitoring flights, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in a position to intervene &mdash; and would do so &mdash; if there is evidence of any kind that people are being detained unlawfully or that a crime is being committed on Irish soil. However, the Deputy has extrapolated from the fact that a certain aircraft flew particular people from Sweden to some other destination a theory that the same aircraft was used to transport prisoners illegally through Shannon on the 13 occasions in the past two years on which it used the airport. We have been assured that this is not the case. I have no reason to believe that it is the case.</P><Col N="1091"/>
        <P>The Deputy has made assertions and asked me to place garda&iacute; on the apron at Shannon to disprove them. However, there is not one shred of evidence that an offence of the type to which he refers was committed under Irish law or that any unlawful act took place on Irish soil.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda has better things to do, one of which is to prevent breaches of international law. What steps have been taken to ensure that no breaches of international law have been committed on board Gulfstream N379P while in Ireland since the incident in 2001? How many planes have stopped at Shannon Airport while on their way to Guantanamo Bay? How can the Minister provide assurances that what the US authorities have said is correct in light of their record in respect of passports? I refer here to the case involving Colonel North when assurances were given that there had been no breaches of international law but when it subsequently emerged that such breaches had been committed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh should become excited about the use of Irish passports. He should consider the case of the Colombia Three when he next becomes excited about this matter.</P>

	<P>It is amusing to see the pot calling the kettle black. If I take the Deputy&rsquo;s logic and not trust anything that comes from the United States because, as the Deputy has alleged, Irish passports were once abused by that country&rsquo;s intelligence services, it follows that I should never take anything on faith from Sinn F&eacute;in because members of that party on a delegation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>the number of prisoners placed in solitary confinement, that is, padded isolation cells in 2002, 2003 and 2004.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27082/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The isolation cells referred to in the question were used a total of 851 times during the year 2002, 970 times during 2003 and 792 times during 2004 to date. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution also reports the incidence of the use of isolation cells in these years as 268, 178 and 190, respectively. These include the use of other cells which are simply unfurnished as opposed to the type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, shortly after my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I visited a number of prisons and saw padded cells in use. What I saw was, in my view, not acceptable and I immediately made that known to the prison authorities. Padded cells of the classic kind are the size of enlarged telephone booths, the walls are grey and there is a pilot light in the ceiling. In one of the cells I saw a prisoner, a man in his 40s, lying in his underpants in a foetal position on the floor with a pot beside him. The cell in question was approximately the size of an outsized refrigerator. That was unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Unlike other Members of the House, however, I took action in respect of this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I immediately told the Irish Prison Service to commission new cells of this kind. We established an implementation group and six cells, based on two different designs, have been completed in Cloverhill Prison. I inspected these in the course of construction and I will visit them in the near future. I intend to roll out such cells across the Irish Prison Service.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the cells include larger windows, doors with full-face observation windows, cell lighting as close to natural daylight as possible, a communication system, including a cell call system, a television, where possible, in-cell sanitation and other technical improvements in the materials used to finish the walls and to improve the quality of the mattresses, blankets and beds. That is what I have achieved and, just in case Members get active on this subject, their parties were all in office and those cells were all there when they held office, and I do not recall any of them lifting a finger to change them.</P>

Does the Minister agree the restrictions he outlined, even for the new cells, which do not provide for environmental stimulation and socialisation, will create further difficulties and cause permanent psychiatric disability in certain circumstances, as research has found in the United States? Does he also agree confinement can result in mentally ill prisoners becoming totally confused, resulting in random violence, self-harm and suicidal behaviour? According to Dr. Smith of the Central Mental Hospital, using a padded cell to address psychiatric disability is a grotesque way of holding a human being. Does the Minister concur that the provision of isolation cells is totally unsuitable for mentally ill prisoners? They should be in a medical environment with proper psychiatric services. I accept the Minister set up a committee when he took up office but, given that 78% of people using those cells have a psychiatric condition, why was a psychiatrist not on the committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good question. I thank the Deputy for recognising that I am the first Minister for Justice to tackle this scandal. I fully accept that putting people who are psychiatrically ill into an isolation cell where they are separated from all means of self-harm is not the appropriate medium or long-term solution, even if it is only for a matter of days. That is why I have been anxious to ensure people who become acutely psychiatrically ill, in circumstances where such facilities are appropriate to prevent them from harming themselves, are speedily transferred to <Col N="1094"/>proper forensic psychiatric care units in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Deputy referred to Dr. Smith in this respect. One of the problems is ensuring these cases are addressed in a speedy manner so that people are not left in the circumstances I have described for two or three days while psychiatrists argue about whether they are suitable for treatment in the hospital or elsewhere. The Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service should have a close working relationship so that people in these circumstances are dealt with in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks. Doctors can differ about the status of a psychiatrically ill person but the notion that the Irish Prison Service should be left in the intolerable position of holding him in an isolation cell while a dispute takes places over whether he is suitable for treatment in the Central Mental Hospital is wholly unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>When will psychiatric patients in prisons be treated in the same way as a prisoner suffering from a general medical condition? That should be the approach. A psychiatric prisoner should be treated in a similar fashion to a prisoner who has broken his leg. Is it acceptable that one prisoner who was depressed and mutilated himself should spend 25 out of 30 days in isolation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there should be the same standards of psychiatric care as ordinary medical care. Sometimes isolation does not involve a padded cell. The Central Mental Hospital should be located in buildings that can accommodate at short notice people who experience acute psychiatric illness episodes.</P>

        <QRef>[27290/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 124 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>In a circumstance where a parent of an Irish-born child, who is properly subject to a deportation order, refuses to disclose the location of his or her child to the authority responsible for effecting the deportation, which is the Garda national immigration bureau, it is not possible to inform the relevant child welfare authorities of the child&rsquo;s whereabouts. If, after the deportation has been effected, the parent or his or her support groups or legal representatives in Ireland communicate this information to the authorities or where this information comes to light by other means, the relevant authorities will be informed immediately.</P>
        <P>In general, it is a matter for parents of a child who is not liable to be deported to make a decision on the welfare of that child if they are deported. Ordinarily, parents have a moral and constitutional duty as well a duty as well as a right to provide properly for their children&rsquo;s upbringing and this duty is recognised by the Constitution. If parents acting in good faith, however, leave their children in the care and custody of another appropriate person, the State will not interfere with those arrangements as long as the decision does not amount to a failure in the duty towards their child which would justify State intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of these cases have been reported to the Department over the past while? Section 37(1) of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that there must be reasonable access to the child by his or her parents. Is the Minister ensuring this provision should be met in these circumstances? These cases are harsh and extreme but the State has a legal duty to observe the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991. What action does the Minister intend to take?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of people with Irish-born children deported between February 2003 and October 2004 was 37. I am not in a position to give an accurate account of how many people have left the State and left Irish-born children behind them because they do not inform the authorities. Having regard to the total number of people with IBCs who have been deported, it can only involve a handful of cases.</P>
        <P>A parent is entitled to leave his or her child in the custody of somebody else as long as he or she is not in breach of his or her legal duty towards his or her child. If parents choose to make that decision for their child in good faith, the State is not at liberty to interfere with the decision. However, just as in the US, parents of children <Col N="1096"/>who are citizens are required to leave when their status becomes illegal. If they make a choice in good faith to leave their child in the custody of a relative or friend who will look after the child, I cannot legally interfere with that arrangement. However, at the same time, I am not willing to accept a situation where people can resist deportation by saying they will consciously fail in their duty towards their child.</P>
        <P>As long as people do not act in breach of their duty towards their children, I cannot interfere. Where garda&iacute; become aware of a child who is at risk in these circumstances, it is their duty to notify the relevant welfare authorities so that the child&rsquo;s welfare can be guaranteed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are duties and obligations on the parents and on the State. Under that Act the State, through the Department of Health and Children, must facilitate access between the child and its parents. I am concerned that the State is not honouring that obligation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is obviously engaging in legal Jesuitry. He is effectively saying that the Child Care Act 1991 obliges the parents to have effective access in Ireland to their child if they leave the child in Ireland. That is not the law. The parents have a simple choice. It is a natural duty and a natural right antecedent to positive law to bring their child with them and the State facilitates them in every way possible. Where they make in good faith a decision to leave their child behind them, the State is not obliged on that account, under any Child Care Act, to readmit them to Ireland when and if they seek access to their children. Such an obligation would make a mockery of our law and no other State in the world would permit such an abuse of its child care laws to facilitate an effective trampling down of the ordinary law of deportation and residence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the Minister now confirms to the House that there have been 37 deportations of parents of Irish children. In the context of the citizenship debate in the House I ask the Minister to supply exact figures of the number of Irish children, post the Supreme Court case and the L &amp;  O case, who are under threat of deportation. As the Minister will be aware, I have suggested that since this is a finite number, if possible there should be an amnesty for the parents of those children at this stage. The Minister did not have an opportunity to reply to that Bill so he might reply to the point which is very serious. I do not believe we should deport or cause the deportation of Irish children or the parents of Irish children at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to say what age the children were in these 37 cases. The Deputy will appreciate that it cannot be the case that a person comes to Ireland and has a child here and on that account alone &mdash; the Supreme <Col N="1097"/>Court has so held &mdash; are absolutely guaranteed the right to remain in Ireland. The Deputy will also be aware that it has been reported that there are 11,000 people who parented a child in Ireland in these circumstances prior to the Supreme Court decision. I am not in a position to tell the House what proportion of those people are in Ireland today. There is no way I can tell the House because a very significant number, which I cannot quantify, simply had the child here and went home with the Irish passport without informing the Irish authorities one way or the other as to whether they intended to remain here or return home. I cannot make a quantification.</P>
        <P>I say to the people who make the claim in regard to the 11,000 figure prior to the Supreme Court decision and maybe 4,000 or 5,000 post the Supreme Court decision, putting those two figures together, the number of occasions on which I have ordered the deportation of a parent with an Irish child is infinitesimal and gives the lie to the suggestion that I am busily deporting these people on a wholesale basis. The number of occasions where I have directed a parent to bring his or her child out of Ireland is infinitesimal as a percentage of those figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has chartered aircraft.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I remind the Deputy that not everybody on the chartered aircraft is the parent of an Irish-born child. I have given figures to the House recently on the level of deportations. Some 37 cases were instances where the deportees had an Irish child. That is an infinitesimal percentage of the number of people who have claimed to remain in the State by virtue of having a child born in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give some indication of the factor which would cause him to proceed with a deportation of the parents of an Irish child, in particular, people who have been in the State for a long time and who have children born before the Supreme Court decision in early 2003? What factors would cause the Minister to come to the view that they should be deported?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have some rule of thumb. Every case is examined individually. Deportation is only done when it is necessary in the view of the Minister, on advice received, to maintain the integrity of our immigration law and the State&rsquo;s capacity to regulate transit in and out of the State and to prevent the law from being completely usurped or undermined. The number of circumstances that would cause one to stay one&rsquo;s hand in respect of any child and its parents being deported is almost infinite. I do not discuss individual cases in the House and I will not go down that road. I assure the House that very strong reasons can be found that people who would otherwise be strictly liable for deportation should not be deported on a moral values basis. I assure the House that the 37 cases since <Col N="1098"/>February 2003 show that I am not engaging in wholesale deportations of this kind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s common denominator?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is based on humanitarian concerns, including, for instance, the length of stay in Ireland. If children have been here for a long time or if there are a number of children in the family and they are no longer toddlers in arms but have effectively only an Irish culture, in those circumstances I would hesitate significantly before deciding there was something special about the case that required the parents to be deported and to take their child with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the common denominator for the 37 cases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give a common denominator for the 37 cases because these cases are dealt with on a case by case basis.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>the number of garda&iacute; attached to Pettigo Garda station, County Donegal; and if there are plans to increase the number of garda&iacute; attached to this station.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27084/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, that the personnel strength of Pettigo Garda station as at 2 November 2004 is three, all ranks. Resources are augmented from within the district-division as required. Currently local Garda management has no plans to increase the number of personnel at Pettigo Garda station. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in Pettigo with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review by Garda management and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of Pettigo will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In this context, I am pleased to inform the House that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order <Col N="1099"/>offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be assigned to administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing where they will have a real impact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister&rsquo;s reply will be regarded as having much joy for the people of Pettigo. I wonder whether the Minister is familiar with Pettigo and its location and whether he has ever been there. Will he agree it is a unique village? It is situated on the Border, almost straddling the Border. One is in the South when one is on one side of the street in Pettigo and in the North when one is on the other side. This means the village is vulnerable and open to constant intrusions from across the Border.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware there has been a spate of acts of criminality in Pettigo in recent months? Ten or 12 robberies have taken place in which houses were entered and goods stolen which were never recovered. The local credit union has been broken into twice. The safe was taken away on one occasion and the contents have never been recovered. Is the Minister aware that as recently as last July or August, the Garda patrol car was burned to a cinder outside the Garda station in Pettigo and, to my knowledge, no one has been apprehended for that crime? The Garda station was almost burned down and the guttering was burned to a cinder. These are all very serious incidents. Is the Minister happy with the level of Garda activity in Pettigo in view of the litany I have outlined? Is he aware that there is constant toing and froing between Pettigo and Northern Ireland? Kesh in Northern Ireland is four miles from Pettigo and the PSNI station there is open one hour a day. Will the Minister agree that something must be done to prevent these acts of vandalism, which resulted in a mass meeting in Pettigo about a fortnight ago? If we cannot have more garda&iacute; in Pettigo, there should at least be more co-operation between them and the people on the other side to stop these continual acts of vandalism that will result in Pettigo becoming the El Paso of the north west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for bringing these incidents to my attention. If the Deputy had outlined them in the context of putting down his question I would have been in a position to respond to them. The Deputy can rest assured that I will bring everything he has said on the record of the House to the attention of the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for his decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that. I regret he did not know about these activities before I brought them to his attention today. I cast no reflection on the three members stationed <Col N="1100"/>in Pettigo. They cannot be there 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That would be impossible. I listened to the Minister on the monitor in my office talk earlier about what happened in years gone by and what we did and did not do. When we were in power, there were many garda&iacute; in Pettigo. The number is down to the bare minimum now. The Minister has promised 2,000 garda&iacute;. I want to hear that Donegal and Pettigo will get their fair share of what becomes available, and the sooner the better.</P>

	<P>The information requested by Deputy Gilmore on court awards and out of court settlements in actions taken against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of assault, unlawful arrest or other breaches of citizens&rsquo; rights is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>As of 31 December 2003, there were approximately 750 civil actions taken against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on hand. A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens&rsquo; rights is not readily available. However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicates that in 2003, the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available, of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department there were 34 cases of alleged assault, 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest and the remaining 70 cases included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year to date, 111 actions have been initiated or received and they include 37 cases of alleged assault and 22 cases of alleged unlawful arrest.</P>
        <P>The general public may take civil actions against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of these cases have been settled for far less than &euro;25,500. The settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, the Attorney General and State counsel.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner informed me, that incidents that result in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of garda&iacute;, are <Col N="1101"/>examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into <Col N="1102"/>question. One of the principal aims of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that will secure public confidence and address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.</P><Col N="1101"/>

	<P>Is that last point not the reason so many cases are being taken, that no new mechanisms have been put in place and the existing complaints mechanism is so inadequate it does not function?</P>
        <P>Regarding the cases the Minister listed and the costs of those cases, is it not a fact that in respect of assault and unlawful arrest, which make up the majority of the cases, and the other cases also, the majority are settled at the door of the court and the largest proportion of costs are legal costs because they go to the door of the court? Who is responsible for deciding that a settlement will be made? Who is responsible for deciding that the majority of settlements that take place do so at the last moment? Can we get clarification on the reason the taxpayer faces such a huge bill every year in respect of compensation cases arising from Garda misconduct of one type or another?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens in these cases is that the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform act on the advice of the Attorney General in regard to these claims. It is not always the case that they are brought to the door of the court. Frequently, that is not the case but I cannot inform the Deputy that it does not happen on occasions that <Col N="1102"/>they are settled at the door of the court. That is an endemic feature of Irish litigation practice. I agree with the Deputy that it is preferable that there should be a proper case management system and a proper estimation of the liability and quantum issues far earlier in these cases so that legal costs are minimised but in cases of &ldquo;He did, he did not&rdquo;, which is frequently the kind of case we are dealing with, it is sometimes very difficult to know precisely the relative quality of one&rsquo;s own evidence until the matter comes into sharp focus and one is aware of the proposed evidence that is likely to come before a court. It is very easy to fall into the trap of not being able to estimate whether a case will be won or lost until a fairly late stage in the procedure, for obvious reasons. Where the facts are in dispute it is difficult to come to a conclusion as to which side is likely to win.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crowe was in possession. The Deputy has 15 minutes <Col N="1104"/>remaining and I understand he is sharing time with Deputy Gregory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point before lunch that there should be a level playing field regarding the IT colleges and the universities. A point that arose during the discussions with the universities and the heads of the IT colleges was that there was no mechanism in place to allow many IT colleges receive funding from individuals, different groups and so on. Perhaps the Minister could examine that in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns of other Deputies about the make-up of the agency and the membership of the board. Residents are keen that they will have a say and confidence in that agency. There must be balance in that regard. There must also be gender balance in the membership of the agency. The Bill refers to a chairperson but in her contribution the Minister referred to a chairman. There must be balance in this area. The previous Minister for Education and Science, when setting up a particular group, said he would introduce balance and I ask this Minister to give the same commitment. I agree also that there should be trade union representation on the board.</P>
      <P>I welcome that psychiatric services will be maintained in the area. St. Brendan&rsquo;s has served the area well. Given that there is an ageing local population, a facility for the elderly would be important. It could be a step-down facility providing services specifically geared to the elderly. The proposed Dublin city development plan 2005 is seeking a site for an Educate Together school. Perhaps the new agency would consider that. It is the last green site in the area. There are 200 pupils in the school and it has been moved from one premises to another. It is now based in St. Joseph&rsquo;s.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement which provides a good deal of information. However, the timescale for the project is unclear to many residents who regularly ask us about it. When will work begin on the site? How long will it take? In what year will it be finished? We need to get that information to the community. There is a lack of information and that is part of the difficulty that has arisen. The community must have a say in the development of the site and there must be better balance in the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The redevelopment of this major site is of immense importance to the constituency I represent as the site is located in the heart of Dublin Central. I welcome its redevelopment with the campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology as its centre point</P>
      <P>The long-term impact will be to transform this part of Dublin so close to the city centre. It will certainly bring significant change in a way that will benefit the local community and the city generally. Much of the adjoining area is already subject to redevelopment and integrated area plans have been in place for some time. The markets <Col N="1105"/>area, for example, is being redeveloped by the historic area rejuvenation project. The O&rsquo;Connell Street area is also the subject of an integrated area plan.</P>
      <P>These plans are already transforming the areas from Grangegorman to the city centre. West of Grangegorman, the last major city council flats complex at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens has recently been targeted for renewal and, to the east, redevelopment of the Dominick Street flats complex is under way. There is one dramatic difference in the Grangegorman proposal before the House. The renewal of all the other areas is being conducted under the transparent and democratic control of Dublin City Council while this Bill seeks to establish a special development agency to carry out the redevelopment of Grangegorman.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed in principle to the establishment of an agency to spearhead this important project provided it is done in co-operation with Dublin City Council. However, I have a fundamental problem with the composition of the agency as outlined in the Bill. In so far as its membership is specified in the Bill, it is an elitist group divorced from the local communities. If there is to be real accountability, there should at least be provision for a resident from the local community organisations to be in the agency. This would merely be one member of an 11 member body. The member would represent an essential, democratically based ingredient and would enable the agency to work more easily and in harmony with the communities adjacent to it, on whose lives the redevelopment of that site will undoubtedly have a profound impact.</P>
      <P>If the Minister agrees to put a resident in the agency, that resident should not be chosen by the Minister. With no disrespect to the Minister concerned, that would almost inevitably lead to a safe party associate being chosen for the position. That is not what I or the residents in the area have in mind. The resident should be nominated by the various local residents&rsquo; groups, of which there are a number in the areas around Grangegorman. There are responsible, knowledgeable and intelligent residents&rsquo; groups whose representative would be a valuable asset to the deliberations of the agency. The local communities are supportive of the DIT project. If their value is recognised in this way, they would help ensure the speedy progress of the redevelopment. However, the only way their role and value can be fully recognised is if they can nominate a representative as a member of the agency. To refuse this request would be a mistake.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that the Bill establishes a consultative body and that all local interests will be fully represented on it, including the residents. I have some experience of agencies and consultative bodies. I have been a member of the Dublin Docklands Council, the consultative body attached to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. This concept does not work. The con<Col N="1106"/>sultative body is a talking shop. It can debate the most controversial issues <i>ad nauseam</i> and make a recommendation to the authority. The latter can choose to ignore the recommendation and provide no explanation to the consultative body for doing so. As the Minister said earlier, the agency would consider recommendations or submissions. It is a little like a family who, after approaching Dublin City Council for a house, are told they will be considered for a house. That is the last one hears of the house. It is also the last the consultative body would hear of its recommendation if it did not have somebody in the agency to press the case and to ensure that the concerns of the residents are being addressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the flexibility to ensure that a local resident nominated by the established residents&rsquo; groups in the area can be put on the agency. The agency has 11 members in all and fewer than half of them have been specified. In this way, the residents would have a genuinely meaningful role on the agency. If that concession is granted, I will gladly support this Bill. If, however, residents are consigned to the so-called consultative body, I will not be able to support it wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>In any area of major redevelopment, it should be a basic right of the people who live there to be represented on the agency overseeing the renewal of the area. As an extension of that principle, section 11 of the Bill refers to the preparation of a strategic plan by the agency. It lists the bodies with which it will consult in doing so. Again, there is no mention of the local community. This omission is extraordinary. Not only is it a serious error, it is an affront to the hard working, responsible local residents&rsquo; organisations. I trust this error will be rectified by the Minister on Committee Stage. If not, it will be seen as symptomatic of both her approach and that of the legislation to local residents.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>When the Bill refers to other &ldquo;interested parties&rdquo;, it is talking about the residents but it specifies certain interested groups, not the residents. This illuminates the approach towards the local residents of those involved in drawing up the legislation. I would like this to be rectified and for the residents to have right of place and to be specified in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 11 has a further equally serious omission. The section lists the objectives for the redevelopment of the Grangegorman site but it does not specifically mention the commitment given in this House in reply to parliamentary questions, many of which I tabled. I refer to the commitment to allocate a site to the Dublin 7 Educate Together non-denominational primary school. I ask the Minister to make specific provision for the school in section 11 and make clear that a site must be set aside to accommodate this school. A commitment was given by the Taoiseach in parliamentary replies to myself and other local Deputies. It should be in the Bill but is not, and I hope it will be inserted by the Mini<Col N="1107"/>ster on Committee Stage so there will be no confusion or vagueness about the matter. The Dublin 7 Educate Together school is a terrific tribute to the parents and staff who built it up from nothing and who sourced several buildings at different stages and different locations to house the school on a temporary basis while waiting for a site at Grangegorman, where they can finally achieve their goal of a permanent base for a modern school building. This commitment must be honoured and provision must be made for it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 11 sets down as part of the strategic plan the objective of the provision of recreational facilities. It is most important that any such facilities be shared with and accessible to the local residents. Again, commitments have been given that the amenities of the site will be available to the local community. However, this should be clearly set down as an objective of the strategic plan. The Minister in her remarks stated that such access is envisaged. While I am quite good with the English language, I am not 100% sure what &ldquo;envisaged&rdquo; means. It either means there is a commitment to ensure that the local community will have access to these amenities or not. If there is a commitment, it should be specified in the Bill. Every other relevant agency and the part it will play is specified in the Bill. Equally, access for the residents should be specified and should be clearly set down as an objective of the strategic plan.</P>

I only left the membership of the DIT when some ludicrous legislation was invoked, brought in by what Government I do not know, which precludes Deputies and Senators from being members of such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will regret that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ring fencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not ring fencing. I pay tribute to the Minister for bringing forward the Bill. As Chief Whip, she took a particular interest in ensuring it would be brought forward. I know also of the particular interest of the Taoiseach in ensuring the Bill would reach the Statute Book.</P><Col N="1108"/>
      <P>Those of us who have been for many years associated with the VEC, the DIT and other agencies might be tempted to ask &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; in regard to the former Albert College grounds. When the late Jim Tunney was Leas-Cheann Comhairle and vice-chairman of the VEC and Paddy Donegan was chairman, they wanted to move the DIT onto what is now the DCU site. DCU has grown from humble beginnings to being a significant academic institution. In some respects, it is a pity the opportunity was not available to allow the City of Dublin VEC to locate that part of its development on the Albert College site. Sin sc&eacute;al eile and there is no point going back over it.</P>
      <P>The Bill presents a major opportunity for a significant contribution to be made not just to education but to Dublin city. When I speak on topics such as this, I like to consider the final page of a Minister&rsquo;s speech. I am pleased to note what the Minister stated earlier. The conclusion of her speech is as close as one could get to a mission statement in regard to this project. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">the DIT at this north inner city location will make a significant contribution to the redevelopment of this part of the city. This role will extend to education and training, underpinning economic activity within the surrounding area, enhancing access opportunities, extending cultural facilities, provision of recreational and sporting facilities, rebuilding and developing large areas of dereliction and creating direct and indirect employment opportunities. To this end the institute is working in close co-operation with my Department, Dublin City Council, representative groups, development associations. . .</P>
      <P FLI="0">In fulfilling the mission outlined by the Minister in her contribution, DIT and Dublin city will be transformed and huge opportunities will be presented to the young and not so young to study at the range of levels for which the DIT is noted. If I get an opportunity, I will say a word or two in their ears in regard to the dangers of upward academic drift. Some of those in the Gallery know my views on that issue.</P>
      <P>The 73 acre site was identified in the late 1980s by the then acting director, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Donnell, the principal of DIT Bolton Street, as an ideal location for the relocation of the DIT campus. We all know and the Minister has stated how dispersed the DIT campus is, stretching over perhaps 39 different locations throughout the city. The locations are as disparate as Prussia Street and Sackville Place as well as the high profile sites at Rathmines, Kevin Street, Bolton Street, Chatham Row and Cathal Brugha Street. In addition, the White House and all sorts of other coloured premises have been and are associated with DIT.</P>
      <P>Central to the development of DIT were Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Donnell and his colleagues, Mr. Tom Madden, Mountjoy Square, the late Mr. Jim <Col N="1109"/>Hickey, director of the College of Commerce, as it then was, in Rathmines, Mr. Bob Lawlor, Cathal Brugha Street, Mr. Frank Brennan, Kevin Street and Mr. Frank Heneghan, College of Music, Chatham Row. I am sure I have left out some names but those mentioned and their colleagues, working closely with the academic council of the DIT, were an enthusiastic, visionary and ambitious group and were the first to succeed in persuading Government.</P>
      <P>I note that one of the officials present in the House worked closely with the then Minister for Education, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, in bringing about a unified structure for the DIT. I had the opportunity to make an input to the development of the DIT as a unified structure using a faculty structure. While not all the aims set out were achieved, a long journey was undertaken and much was achieved.</P>
      <P>The underdevelopment of that part of the city is a further matter. Apart from the Liberties area of Dublin city, this was the most historic part of the city associated with the Vikings, Normans and medieval era. It was ripe for transformation. A body similar to the one proposed in the Bill has achieved much for Dublin inner city, the Docklands, Temple Bar, Smithfield, Collins Barracks and Kilmainham. An agency not unlike this has been successful in transforming housing in Ballymun.</P>
      <P>Tribute must be paid to those who established the colleges of technology and the apprentice schools, many of whom have gone to their eternal reward. Tribute should also be paid to local elected representatives who, through their membership of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and associated bodies, worked with the committed staff of the institute in developing an educational structure for Dublin, second to none. Dublin City Council can take pride in establishing the College of Music in Chatham Row, long before such colleges were developed in other cities.</P>
      <P>The Minister and other Members spoke of the range of courses offered by the Dublin Institute of Technology. This is education provision at every level, from apprenticeship right through to post-doctoral study. The Minister has the laudable intention to promote high-end research, high quality interaction with industry and create synergies with the scientific community. These should be pursued at a more accelerated level. However, I must urge caution. It is not right that the Dublin Institute of Technology is the poor relation in this area to many other universities. It has a unique ability to develop the area of applied research which the more traditional academic universities have not pursued. There was the pioneering work of Dr. Marlene Proctor on food matters in Cathal Brugha Street where it was neither popular nor remunerative to become involved in research projects. I remember the difficulties experienced by the Dublin Institute of Technology directors in trying to access meagre <Col N="1110"/>funds from the Government to become involved in pioneering work in the food technology area.</P>
      <P>I know of the work of Kevin Street in ophthalmics with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, in the days when it was unheard of colleges and universities to work with hospitals or industry. I am aware of the pioneering work of the product development centre carried out in Prussia Street in a leased IDA Ireland building. At a time when campus companies were unheard of in Ireland, Michael O&rsquo;Donnell, a former principal of Bolton Street, first spoke about them after he saw them in operation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The setting up of the Dublin Business Innovation Centre was first mooted around the boardroom table in Bolton Street. The pioneering work taken on by the Dublin Institute of Technology has been truly significant.</P>
      <P>However, there comes a time when opportunities for further development have to be undertaken. Members associated with the Dublin Institute of Technology are aware of the difficulties encountered in trying to provide basic library services. Until recently, library services were provided in co-operation with Dublin City Council libraries, both doing a good job. However, it is not possible to provide a high quality service if libraries are dispersed in several locations. Having different admissions offices caused difficulties. The purchase of Mount Street as the headquarters for the Dublin Institute of Technology admissions office was a significant improvement. The Central Applications Office has taken over that development.</P>
      <P>I recall when I was chairman of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee the opening of extensions at Bolton Street, designed by the architect of the tremendous Croke Park stadium, Des McMahon, and Kevin Street. I recall the gestation of the Bishop Street project and how difficult it was to reach construction stage on it. The buildings are now on Aungier Street. I am aware of the difficulties in procuring buildings for the marketing school in Mountjoy Square. The square was transformed because the Dublin Institute of Technology had the courage and stubbornness to stay there. I doubt if the redevelopment of Mountjoy Square would have occurred if the Dublin Institute of Technology, Tom Madden, Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan and those activists &mdash; considered irritating at the time &mdash; from the TUI had not been dogged in their pursuit of accommodation for the marketing school.</P>
      <P>Significant additional investment is now required to bring some of these buildings to the standard expected in a modern, technological university. Bolton Street is a fine building. It is noteworthy that we speak of Bolton Street and not the college of technology in Bolton Street. The building and the apprentice school however are limited. It is opportune that the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill has been introduced.</P>
      <P>The various task forces, Science Foundation Ireland and Forf&aacute;s have highlighted in their var<Col N="1111"/>ious reports how acutely important is research. In my time, I have presented several thousand certificates in the Dublin Institute of Technology. Each one had to be signed individually. The presentations I got most satisfaction from were those of the apprentices, those who came in from the construction sites after work in the evenings and the catering workers who attended Cathal Brugha St. college after a day&rsquo;s work to upskill, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned.</P>
      <P>I urge the Dublin Institute of Technology to remember it is an important and significant educational institution producing high quality qualifications at every level. It has a large contribution to make in apprentice and in-service education for the ordinary workers. Not everybody will be a doctor or hold a masters degree. However, it is important for the Dublin Institute of Technology to maintain contact with those in other employment sectors.</P>
      <P>The opportunity must be availed of to use the finances released from the sale of significant sites around Dublin city to develop this project. I hope to live long enough politically to see that project realised. People such as the artist Robert Ballagh saw the possibility of having a real public transport connection to that area because of the proximity of the site to Broadstone Station.</P>
      <P>We are all talking about what needs to be done to develop infrastructure in urban and rural areas and we must remember that the Broadstone Station was an important national railway terminal. There is no reason that part of the city could not be opened up again. I hope plans for a metro to Dublin Airport will soon be confirmed and that the line would start somewhere around Broadstone, go out through Glasnevin, Ballymun and on to the airport. There are great opportunities for links to different parts of the city.</P>
      <P>Consultation, to which Deputy Gregory referred, is vital. I have experience of how consultation can be interpreted in different ways by the agency that is supposed to do the consulting and by those who are consulted. We have a model of development in Ballymun, Ballymun Regeneration Limited, which is a company whose composition is not unlike what is suggested here. As is proper, it produced a master plan for the area in consultation with the local community. I utter a note of caution to those who will be responsible for consultation. It is not good enough just to consult about the master plan, that is the big picture, the problems will occur in regard to the width of streets, size of footpaths, height of buildings and their finish. They are the irritants that cause great annoyance to local communities.</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to who should be represented on the proposed agency and, although it is unfashionable to say it, I believe local public representatives should be on it. We are selling ourselves short as elected representatives in not demanding representation on agencies like this. Public representatives already successfully rep<Col N="1112"/>resent communities. The board members of Ballymun Regeneration Limited includes community representatives. I see no reason, in addition to community representatives, public representatives of Dublin City Council cannot be bona fide members of this body.</P>
      <P>Methods of consultation can vary. I have seen very successful consultations take place, for example, on the port tunnel. Although the consultation got off to a very shaky start, as did the tunnel, the model of consultation has settled down to a great extent.</P>
      <P>Access by people not just from disadvantaged areas but those who left school early and by adults will be acutely important in future. I visited UCLA last year or the year before where 80% of students in one of its colleges were mature students. That is the way forward, in addition to doctoral and other high-end research at which DIT excels. Wider participation in education will be important for the future.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill and to support it. I look forward to the day when I might receive an invitation to be present at the cutting of the ribbon, turning of the sod, laying of the foundation stone or a graduation ceremony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle may wonder why I intend speaking on the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill. The main reason I speak about it is the contributions I heard from my Dublin colleagues and the Minister, whom I congratulate on the first legislation she is steering through the D&aacute;il. It is wonderful that no fight was required for this, although Deputy Carey may disagree with me. We have GMIT in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am here. I think I was responsible for getting it because the money was granted for it when I got elected in the hope that I would not get elected the next time. I was also responsible for getting a hospital for the county. If I never did anything else in politics they are two things for which I can take credit, the GMIT and Mayo General Hospital. The Ceann Comhairle knows the hospital as he was down there on many occasions when he had another brief.</P>
      <P>I do not have anything against Dublin. I know the ushers are listening because they always say I am critical of Dublin, the city and its people. I am not, but I must say there will be no shortage of money. Nobody will have to lobby or hold protest meetings. People will not have to block up roads to get this project up and running. Because it is in Dublin, it is in Ireland; Dublin is Ireland. Everything is grand and the project will go ahead. All these facilities will be brought under the one roof. A total of 65 acres will be bought from a 73 acre site. It is wonderful and I have no problem with that.</P>
      <P>I wish to give a few examples of how things are in Mayo in terms of investment in education. I <Col N="1113"/>would prefer if the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, were in the House but her officials are here and will bring the message to her loud and clear. We spent more than &euro;1 million on a school in Castlebar. The Ceann Comhairle should listen to this. He will find it hard to believe. This would not have gone on in Russia in its worst day. The sum of &euro;1 million was spent on the school and everybody was delighted. The Minister came down and turned the sod. The job was done. Five years later a new roof had to be put on the new school.</P>
      <P>I tabled two questions in the House last week on this matter. The Ceann Comhairle nearly ruled one out of order and I had to redraft it but it worked out and I got the information I needed. I was informed that almost &euro;300,000 was paid to consultants on this project by the Department of Education and Science. Deputy Carey should listen to this because it is important. That was taxpayers&rsquo; money. It cost almost &euro;1 million to build a school which four to five years later required a brand new roof. The builder was not to blame. The Department of Education and Science was not to blame. The consultant was not to blame. I was informed that the problem was local wind. There is a great deal of wind in this House much of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>Hot air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It comes from all sides of the House. That was the best answer I ever got since I came into this House; local wind. What about all the consultants and professional people that were paid? I tabled a further question to discover how many other schools had been affected by the same problem but I could not get an answer, probably because they were embarrassed so many schools had to be re-roofed. I have news for the Department, it had better get ready as I now intend referring the matter to the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell. I have been in touch with the Ombudsman on the matter and I intend to seek information under freedom of information legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very reluctant to intervene but the Deputy has wandered a little away from the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming around to it. The Ceann Comhairle should not worry. I just want to make the point of what is happening in regard to expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A passing reference is fine, but not a detailed explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to save taxpayers a fortune in regard to Grangegorman. I want to tell the people involved in this proposed scheme that somebody will be watching them. We need somebody to watch the Department and whoever will run the agency. We must ensure the Department <Col N="1114"/>does not make as bad a job of the third level sector as it did of the first and second level sectors. Taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent and I want to see value for money on this project.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey and I clashed in another forum. He opposed the case I took in the High Court when I stood up for the public and public representatives. I did not win and I wish I had the money to bring the matter as far as the Supreme Court, but I do not. However, I agree with the point he made regarding public representatives on the board of the agency. I see nothing wrong with Deputies or councillors being appointed to any board. I have no problem with the appointment of any publicly elected representative to any State, school or college board. At least the public elected these people and they have to respond to the people. If questions are asked of them they have to be in a position to respond, not like other vested interests one can never get hold of.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the amalgamation of the DIT under one roof. In Castlebar, a town I represent as well as other parts of County Mayo, we got a college up and running. It is going very well and many people were educated. Deputy Carey is correct, it is wonderful to see people coming back to the educational sector. Young people drop out for various reasons and then return. It might not be a course that we think is fit or good for us but it is good for them because it gets them back into the system. Many of these people do very well when they come out of the institute. The problem in Mayo is that some courses will be taken away. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, notify the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, that we are looking for funding for the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology campus in Castlebar? I also seek a commitment from the Minister and the Government that money be spent on research to ensure that more courses are created at the institute. Many people fought hard to get that college. Paddy McGuinness and I, and other elected representatives and members of the public worked hard to get it up and running.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology property is all State property. While I note some is being bought from the health authority, it is all taxpayers&rsquo; money, whether we like it or not. Some of the land in and around the city of Dublin on which the buildings that are sold are situated should be made available for housing developments which should include facilities for young people. The greatest mistake we made in this State was not to put in place facilities for young people.</P>
      <P>I hope the campus in Grangegorman succeeds because I am not a begrudger. That said, I like to see Mayo and the west getting their fair share of the national cake. I do not like to see everything going to Dublin although it deserves its fair share too because it has many disadvantaged which need employment and amenities. The Minister and the officials in the Department should, when building a new school or college, ensure the facili<Col N="1115"/>ties are made available in off-peak times, such as weekends or summer months, when schools do not use the premises. That applies to all colleges and institutes as well. We should encourage and help young people so as to educate them. We made mistakes in the past by building thousands of houses without providing facilities. Now we wonder why crime is rife. One can visit my county or any housing estate in the city and see what is happening.</P>
      <P>I hope that when plans are drawn up for the construction of this facility, the Department and whoever has responsibility when the agency is set up works with the local community to ensure it is not told what is happening as planning permission is being sought, something that often happens. Before such permission is sought, those involved in the agency should consult the local community and listen to its ideas and suggestions. Taxpayers pay for these facilities and should have an input. It is wrong that they are told something is happening and must put up with it. Ministers should work with local communities.</P>
      <P>I do not know much about Grangegorman but I am sure it needs many facilities and I hope that whatever is needed is put in place. There is no point building a facility such as this if no student accommodation is to be available at a reasonable price for those who use it. Over the years people have had to come to Dublin from throughout the country to be educated because the colleges of their choice, or the one for which they were selected or had the points, are located in the city. Parents spend weeks trying to find accommodation at a reasonable price and in a safe place. This issue should be discussed beforehand and accommodation put in place. This proposal should be discussed with the local community because I have seen in Cork and elsewhere that student accommodation can be rented out for the summer months, for example, on the weekends of All-Ireland matches. When this agency is put in place under the provisions of the Bill, it could manage the accommodation as well as the facilities. I hope that will happen because it is important to have good facilities for young people.</P>
      <P>I wish Grangegorman the best of luck and will watch it very carefully. It will not have the difficulties we had in Mayo which were such that we fought Ministers and Government and had to bring people onto the streets and make it a major political issue. The Castlebar campus is up and running and I hope it will not be interfered with by stealth by the removal of some courses. I will fight that. We fought hard for it and all we need are some resources from the State. The Minister and her officials should ensure that facility is left there. It has done great work and certainly has educated people who may not have had a chance before but have returned to education.</P>
      <P>A man came to my clinic approximately a fortnight ago, following which I tabled some <Col N="1116"/>parliamentary questions with the result that F&Aacute;S will examine the issue. The man is a thatcher who came in from England. He does not have enough hours in the day to do the work that is needed. Thatchers are being brought in from all over Europe to work here. As far as he is aware, he is the only one in the west. He said he would do it for the State at a reasonable cost. He is not looking for a job because he has too much work to do but said he would make his expertise available to the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology in Castlebar or Galway or to the Dublin Institute of Technology. He is willing to train young people because he has no family and cannot pass on his skill. Would it not be better to train our people to give them jobs and for the trade to be passed on to another generation? We will lose it unless we do something about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey spoke about the baking industry and he is right. One can go to any city in continental Europe and see small bakeries and shops. There were once many bakeries in this country but multi-national stores and supermarkets took over and we lost many young people from that trade. That area is an opening for young people. I spoke to someone recently who is thinking about taking this up as a profession but he is having difficulty finding a place where he can get an apprenticeship. He wants to set up a bakery in a town because bread is not baked every day. I wrote to the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology to inquire would there be any hope of setting up courses for that in Castlebar. There must be many people with business ideas who want to be educated and do something about it.</P>
      <P>It is good to have doctors and nurses and consultants but it is important to have apprenticeships as well and to cater for people such as this man. I was glad to hear Deputy Carey say that his most joyful day was signing certificates for an apprenticeship. It is important because although all parents want their sons and daughters to be doctors or consultants, we also need people to bake and thatch. I advise them not to be politicians if they can avoid it because it is not a simple job and nothing in politics is easy any more. Many ideas can be used.</P>
      <P>The Castlebar campus of the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology should be preserved. We fought hard for it. With some commitment from the Department of Education and Science and from those running the institute, it will work. I do not want to see courses removed and staff withdrawn to the Galway campus to the point that there is a crisis and we cannot enrol sufficient numbers to fill the courses. We will not get enough people if we do not run the courses for them. It is important that we get money to do research and provide further courses, whether by day or night, to give people the chance of an education.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be passed because the agency is based in Dublin and our Taoiseach and many of the Ministers are from the city. There will be no <Col N="1117"/>shortage of money. It will be found for Dublin. When the Dublin Institute of Technology property in and around Dublin is sold, some of that money should go to the west. We do not want to see all of it spent in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Fitzpatrick. Would Deputy Ring give support if the Taoiseach was from Mayo? I might be stretching credibility by suggesting that. The Deputy might be putting himself under pressure if he said that. I admire the manner in which he spoke about his constituency and for the number of times he managed to mention GMIT during the course of his contribution.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004 came before our education committee in the past couple of months. The staff in DIT very kindly brought the committee out to see the site at Grangegorman. They gave us a presentation on it, explained what their ambitions were and what the difficulties were. One of the major difficulties they were having was that this particular legislation needed to be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before they could proceed. They are very pleased that this is now in process and the Bill will become law as soon as possible and allow the agencies to be set up so that this exciting development can proceed further.</P>
      <P>I have personal experience of DIT as I lectured there in labour law in Cathal Brugha Street some years ago. One of the problems with DIT is the outlying nature of the buildings. I was giving lectures in Cathal Brugha Street and running down the road to Sackville Place where there were other rooms. This was something that was repeated by staff in DIT for years. The rationalisation of buildings into one single development makes great sense. More important than that, we have to justify the enormous investment in education by the State by showing how it will benefit the wider community.</P>
      <P>There have been similar investments in inner city areas in recent times. One of them was the digital hub area. An agency was set up to try to encourage development in the local area, to bring people in as stakeholders and to make sure that there was a trickle down effect of the wealth and the investment in the digital hub for people in the area. The digital hub development agency recently set up the liberty time capsule where they symbolically buried a time capsule for 50 years time and it was the ambition that in that time, everyone living in that area would have benefited from the investment that the Government has put into it.</P>
      <P>The Diageo Liberties learning initiative and other initiatives have brought great hope and confidence to the area. It is an acknowledged fact that the local residents are enjoying using digital technology in school and community settings. This is a template for largescale Government funding into inner-city areas. The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was established in <Col N="1118"/>1997. One of its specific functions as an authority was to ensure sustainable economic and social regeneration of that area. The ambition is to develop the Dublin docklands into a world class city quarter, one in which the whole community enjoys the highest standards of access to education, employment, housing and social amenities, and which delivers a major contribution to the social and economic prosperity of Dublin and the whole of Ireland. Some progress has been made in that area. This year, 116 students received bursaries to allow them access to third level. By 2006, pursuant to the Planning Act 2000, over 200 social and affordable houses will have been built in that area under the auspices of the authority.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, more could have been done in both cases. I hope the area contiguous with Grangegorman will benefit from the investment the Government makes. Nonetheless, a large amount of this development will be self-financing. DIT is in possession of a considerable amount of buildings and land which it indicates it will be able to sell off. It has access to funding of its own and it will also borrow under the terms of this Bill. The Government investment is not as great as the benefit to the community. The business incubation models that exist in most universities are reciprocated in DIT as well. This is another return for the State. There is no question but that the State will benefit in this sense.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the breakdown of the Bill itself. It contains some interesting developments that are not dissimilar to the Dublin Docklands Authority and the digital hub development agency. Section 11 of the Bill states that there must be a strategic plan for the development of recreational facilities. Some Deputies are concerned about making sure that the campus is sustainable and that it provides balance in the services it makes available to the students and local population. Unusually, it requires that the agency consult with local public representatives, such as Deputies and councillors. That is something I have never seen in a Bill before. Section 14 deals with the crucial borrowing requirement. Section 20 sets up a stakeholders&rsquo; group. In the legislation for creating a digital hub, one member of the local community is nominated to the digital hub agency. In this Bill, the local community is part of this stakeholders&rsquo; group, a consultation group which ensures that they will definitely have an input into the way in which the development carries on.</P>
      <P>The important thing for DIT is to ensure that in the development process over the next few years, local residents are brought into the project. The elements of the Bill that refer to local representatives and local residents are fully enacted and fully carried out. It is important that they never take their eye off the goal that this Government invests large amounts of money in inner-city areas for the good of the whole country and for Dublin. It is not just a case of investing for <Col N="1119"/>the benefit of DIT. From my meetings with members of staff of DIT and from their own presentations to the education committee, it is absolutely clear that they have that target in mind. They propose to keep the interests of the people of the area very much to the forefront. There is no doubt that the local economy will benefit and I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick will give more detail about that. Naturally, the secondary students that are trying to get into third level will have to be brought in to this. There must be ways of ensuring that the lack of equity of access to third level is addressed in this area for the benefit of everyone, as has happened in Tallaght. The benefit must also be for the area, as has happened in the digital hub and the financial services area.</P>

	<P>I welcome this Bill. It is a pity Deputy Ring is not here as he was speaking about the roof in Castlebar. DIT may be able to provide the research facilities as it has a building trade school that would obviate the loss of a roof after five years. I agree with him; I doubt the wind in Castlebar is any more dangerous than any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital in Grangegorman is the oldest public psychiatric hospital in the country. As a result of the movement towards community care, it was given renewed emphasis in the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s publication, Planning for the Future, in 1984. The Ceann Comhairle will remember that. The hospital, which had over 2,000 patients in the 1930s, now has less than 400. The original buildings which opened in 1815 as the Richmond Lunatic Asylum are now derelict and empty, although some offices are still in use. The main fabric of the buildings is still in sound structural condition.</P>
      <P>It is fortunate that I can consider the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004 from a medical perspective. I was once a member of the former Eastern Health Board, which has long since been replaced. When a senior officer of the health board proposed that the Richmond Lunatic Asylum buildings be entered into a competition for the Europa Nostra award, a lowly member of the health board pointed out that the asylum&rsquo;s beautiful old wooden windows, which dated back to the 18th century, had been replaced by aluminium windows. We were immediately precluded from entering any kind of competition, in Europe or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The history of the Grangegorman institution relates to more than one hospital. In its early days, it was the only public lunatic asylum in the country. I am using the language that was used in days gone by to describe such institutions, which was a reflection of how such matters were viewed. The Irish word for &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; is &ldquo;faoiseamh&rdquo;, which highlights that such institutions were founded to allow people to withdraw from the stresses and strains of life, to receive some care and to be helped back to good health. Physicians <Col N="1120"/>and governors laid down the ground rules for the district lunatic asylum system, which, for all its defects, provided a haven for the mentally ill and the handicapped when no other such system existed. The spirit that animated the first governors of the asylum remained with the various committees which administered the institution over the years.</P>
      <P>One needs only to read reports of some of the public inquiries into the asylum to appreciate that there were administrative failures over the years. From time to time, the staff of the asylum failed in their duty of care to the people in their care. The governors were concerned not only with managing the hospital, but also with seeking a general improvement in care and social attitudes towards the mentally disordered. The hospital&rsquo;s physicians were foremost in advancing the boundaries of psychiatric care from its earliest days.</P>
      <P>Before the establishment of the Richmond Lunatic Asylum in 1815, there was no place of care for the mentally ill in Ireland. I assure Deputy Ring that some of the original 1815 roofs are still in place. They must be in good order because they can still keep out the rain. General hospital care was non-existent before the asylum was established. Leper houses and other charitable institutions which had been established in the Middle Ages were closed when the monasteries were dissolved and not much was provided in their place. The mentally ill fared badly because they got into trouble for their bizarre manners and often violent outbursts. They were often left to languish in prisons and alms houses, sometimes half starved and naked.</P>
      <P>I know the site well, as a former member of the board of the hospital. I studied there, just as the Ceann Comhairle did. It is an historic area. I am keen that the buildings and historical ambience of the area be preserved in any future development of the site, which is bounded by Prussia Street and Stoneybatter, which is known in Irish as B&oacute;thar na gCloch. The locality is where Irish was last spoken as the daily language of the people of Dublin. The site is also bounded by Brunswick Street, Constitution Hill, North Circular Road and the old Broadstone railway station, which Deputy Carey argued earlier should be used again. If the Luas line is brought to the airport, it should be brought through Broadstone because the road on which the track was once laid is still in place as far as Cabra and the edge of Finglas.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that the transfer of the Dublin Institute of Technology to the St. Brendan&rsquo;s campus will facilitate major social, educational and health benefits in the Grangegorman area. One should not forget that nine acres of the site, which was first occupied by a health facility in 1815, will be retained for future use as the location of a health facility. There is a serious need for step-down facilities, neurology facilities and psychiatric facilities in the area. The development plan <Col N="1121"/>for this important site should be drawn up in full consultation with the surrounding communities. The area is home to many institutions which were located there without reference over the years to the needs of local people or consultation with the local community.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Bill provides for the appointment of 11 members of the development agency, including the chairman. The Minister for Health and Children will nominate two members, one of whom will come from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board or their successors. One member will be nominated by each of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Dublin city manager and the rest will be nominated by the Minister for Education and Science. It is not specified that a member of the agency should be a publicly elected representative. I ask the Minister to consider providing in the Bill that two members of the authority should be elected members of Dublin City Council. It is vitally important that Dublin&rsquo;s citizens should be represented on the agency by public representatives who are directly answerable to them. Previous speakers called for local consultation and local committees to be represented on the agency. Consultation with local people should be as detailed as possible. Many years&rsquo; experience has taught me that locally elected public representatives provide greater continuity of input. They are accountable to their electors because they have to come back to them.</P>
      <P>I welcome DIT to the site, but it faces formidable problems in refurbishing buildings so that they become modern facilities without destroying the fabric of the buildings and the site. I am sure the institute can overcome such problems with the help of those involved in its schools of architecture, engineering and building trades. If they are not up to the task, nobody else will be.</P>
      <P>While we are upwardly mobile in the educational sense, I echo Deputy Carey&rsquo;s comment that we should not forget those who really matter &mdash; people involved in trades. It is important that we should have doctors, consultants and masters, but nothing gets done without the continuing education of people on the ground. I welcome the Bill and recommend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which is really excellent. One often encounters important legislation when one comes to the House, but this is an example of a Bill which has so much going for it because it has got it together to a major extent. It can be seen as a blueprint for our work in many areas. It addresses circumstances which need to be addressed in a rational manner. It is interesting that various services which are being offered at present will be brought together at a single location. The proposal offers great potential not only for the future of the people of the area, but also for the people of the nation. The public appreciates the tremendous potential of this project, which involves the development of approximately 70 acres of land within walking <Col N="1122"/>distance of the centre of our capital city. We are taking the major opportunity which is being offered to us. If the project develops as planned, it will greatly help to make life much better for many people and benefit our country significantly.</P>
      <P>This development is being planned for many reasons, including the current scattered nature of DIT. It is most interesting that the site of St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital in Grangegorman has been chosen as the location of the new campus. I am involved in the St. Brendan&rsquo;s village project in Mulranny, County Mayo. The Grangegorman site would be an ideal location for a project similar to the Mulranny village, which involves bringing a sense of community back to the people. The village allows people to stay in their home areas, regardless of how old or disabled they are. It is interesting that the Grangegorman project is being pursued by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, as well as DIT. There is a great opportunity. With Grangegorman and St. Brendan&rsquo;s, the system is institutional. It is the medical system for supporting older people that is inappropriate and out of date. There should be something else, but the problem is that there have not been such things. However, in Grangegorman there is an opportunity to have something like what we have in Mulranny, where there is support for people at home or at the day centre, and low, medium and high support sheltered housing so that no matter how old or disabled someone is, he or she can remain in the local area. That is very important for people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In Dublin, where there is a large population, people say that there are older people everywhere and that our population is ageing. We are now catching up with the rest of Europe in the age of our population and must consider such matters. First and foremost, there is a great opportunity for a St. Brendan&rsquo;s village in this location. That wonderful opportunity should not be missed. We must also be inclusive and not simply think about those who have nothing. Most people have a little, but older people need some supported or sheltered housing since they may not qualify for social housing as such, nor should they when they have enough equity to help support themselves. They would be proud and happy to do so if there were the opportunity. This site offers a wonderful chance to do just that and should not be overlooked in any way.</P>
      <P>My background is that of a general practitioner who lived in urban areas and moved to a rural one in 1981, when I began to see that the most important thing for people was services. If people had services in their area, that kept them there. If one loses the services in an area, one will not stay there. Most of all I noticed that older people were leaving our area because there was nothing for them. Some could live alone in the community in their own house in the country with the support of neighbours, friends and family, but the latter group got older themselves. Neither had emi<Col N="1123"/>grated and when those people could no longer live in the community, having lost the support that would have allowed them to do so, they went to a far-away place where they knew no one. Just like the old Indians, they lost heart and died.</P>
      <P>I call older people in institutions the sad side of migration. Our St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village is about supporting those older people when they are at home, which is best for as long as possible, followed by low support sheltered housing. That way, when they can no longer live in the community by themselves, instead of going to a far-away institution where they know no one, they can stay in their own area in a supportive environment with care provided. When they get a little frailer, they can move sideways. They have no fear of the future if they can move to a medium or higher support unit.</P>
      <P>There is great opportunity for people to do that. It is very much an alternative to the profit-driven, non-community nursing homes which are currently so important because there is nothing else. However, there should be an alternative in the shape of the same type of village as St. Brendan&rsquo;s. I suggest that it be in Grangegorman with other important things such as the DIT. What is more appropriate than having everyone together? Institutes of technology have been of great importance to this country and have played a large role in getting us where we are today. Such bodies as Science Foundation Ireland support the kind of research that institutes of technology and universities conduct, and they are extremely important. We should never lose sight of that. Sometimes, when our budgets are small &mdash; they are always finite &mdash; it is important that we maintain as a priority such important centres of learning and research. I can envisage Grangegorman as the most wonderful facility. It is logical, when one considers how spread out the DIT is, that it all be brought together in one centre; that makes great sense.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in the DIT in Bolton Street because my son is attending it studying civil engineering. That is my vested interest in the matter. However, I have personal experience of the wonderful facilities, in particular it is so inclusive of all strata of society. There are people from rural Ireland and inner city Dublin. We know that the north inner city area has the lowest uptake of education. It is wonderful that the campus will be there in consolidated form to help people who might otherwise not have access to education.</P>
      <P>The institute of technology has something that we have underestimated. Before one goes to university, one has a sheltered background where one enjoys the support of one&rsquo;s parents and so on, but then one goes to a university city or town where one does not have the same supports as at home. The institute of technology takes a more hands-on approach, and it is very appropriate for <Col N="1124"/>younger people who have just left home. They appreciate that support.</P>
      <P>I am greatly supportive of the DIT and what has been done at Grangegorman; it is the way forward. Sometimes I come here from the west and talk about my area of Mayo. Equally, I recognise, as would my GP colleagues in rural Ireland &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle will know all about it &mdash; that in inner city areas too there is a need for services. People must have a service available, whether it be the GP, the post office or whatever. From the start, I saw that the most important thing in rural areas was the maintenance of services.</P>
      <P>There is the notion of rural-proofing legislation to ensure that any change does not injure a rural area but instead supports it. The same is true for inner city areas. They are two ends of the spectrum of neglect, showing where resources should have gone but did not. I greatly welcome the work that has been done. My colleague, Deputy Gregory, was instrumental in causing a great many good things to happen for inner city areas. That was when he held the balance of power and negotiated the Gregory deal with the Taoiseach, which meant a great deal for inner city areas. However, we should not have to depend on such deals. The same goes for rural areas. If I held the balance of power, I would be pushing for rural areas to be developed. We need such things as post offices &mdash; in Achill one recently closed. Such things are simply not acceptable since there must be some kind of public service obligation.</P>
      <P>At one time I stayed in a strange place in Dublin 1 with my wife. We took our little dog with us, which had the role of our first child before we had children. The dog ate poison under the bed. It was nearly dead and we had to go around Dublin with it looking for a vet. Eventually, we found one. The position is the same if one has an ill child and is trying to find a doctor or any other service. We need services in every area and we should be thankful that good medical services are available. The primary care system is probably the only one that is working properly in this country. A same-day service is available to people whether they have money, and that is the bottom line. People on the minimum wage or just above it who deserve to have a medical card have difficulty accessing services because of eligibility problems.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004 is very welcome. It is interesting that this development will be called St. Brendan&rsquo;s Campus since it shares a name with our St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village. There is mention of going from an institutional to a more appropriate community setting. That is exactly what St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village in Mulranny is about &mdash; the community doing something rather than the private sector doing it. I have nothing against the private sector since as long as there is a deficit and it can come in and do something, it will certainly do so, and fair play <Col N="1125"/>to it. However, there should be a community-driven alternative.</P>
      <P>I am of the community. People say to me that I lean towards this party or that, but that is not true. I am independent and represent the community. That is my bottom line since I see it as the way forward, though it is very much the poor relation in all this. There is the State and the private sector, but in the middle comes the community, which has great potential. With Grangegorman, it is very important that there is more community input in the board.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a proper community input into this board. It is a very important agency and I welcome its establishment. The campus should also reflect the community, young people as well as old. The campus will be a centre of learning and research, which the DIT is, and it will be the most valuable and wonderful one, the biggest in the State. It will be important to have proper accommodation for students. There is nothing more wonderful than to see young and old mixed together in an inclusive society. So much has happened to drive people away from rural areas, which had great values. I am not talking in any right wing sense, but about the fact that there was always room for Granny, for the caileach, in the corner, the warmest place in the house, beside the fire. Granny was there in her bed by the fire, where she was safe and warm. People then became sucked into the urban areas, and where was there room for Granny in the flat in Ballymun? Thank God the Ballymun towers have been pulled down because there was no room for Granny there.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is a move back towards community life, which is so necessary and important. This Bill gives an inkling that some sense is being put into planning in Ireland again, with a return to a community focus. This Bill is about going from an acute situation, as it notes, to rehabilitation with regard to the care and support of people. Support is more important than care because care is a sub-set of support. There is an opportunity here for a type of facility which would offer a day centre with low-support housing to allow people to stay in a sheltered environment. That can be done quite easily and would reduce the numbers of people who need to stay in profit-driven non-community nursing homes. There is nothing wrong with such homes, which do a wonderful job and I admire the people who run them. They are not adequately supported and they must make a profit. However, community homes can put the money back into the service to improve it.</P>
      <P>We should think more about community. There is a great opportunity here. Why not get the community involved in running this enterprise? That would work out well. Why must we always think of bringing in the private sector to make a profit? If someone is making a profit, something has to suffer. Resources are finite. I am not against private enterprise or profit as <Col N="1126"/>people must make profit to live, but we now have this opportunity for the community to have its say.</P>
      <P>There are some wonderful opportunities before us in this Bill. The Bill uses the words &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; and &ldquo;dementia&rdquo;. That is wonderful. When I started working in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital in Mulrany, people said that it was not possible to support people with dementia in their own communities and that they would have to enter institutions. That is not true. Over time I have discovered that one can look after older people in their own community. The worst thing one can do with people suffering from dementia is to send them somewhere where they know nobody, where every face is that of a stranger. Those with dementia need to hold on to whatever fix they have on reality. The sally rod does not bend when it ages. An older person sent to hospital becomes very confused. It is important that older people can stay in their own community and get supports there. Why should they need to leave their communities if the supports are there for them? It is the most natural thing in the world for them to remain.</P>
      <P>This Bill also gives the opportunity to create great employment. The hospital in Mulrany employs 60 people. Some of those are community workers but the rest we employ.</P>
      <P>The RTC in Castlebar is important. We have had major worries in the area lately because of a proposal to cut the courses adopted by the executive board. This is currently supposed to be happening in Mayo. The RTC in Castlebar was set up by the Government with great reluctance, in the face of massive public support from the people of Mayo. The people there are very proud of the RTC because they see it as infrastructure. It is all about services, which are just as important in Dublin as they are in Mayo, as important in Grangegorman as they are in Mulrany, as important near Dublin city as in Castlebar or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>This is all about allowing people the opportunity to stay in their own area. One might live in an area where one discovers the doctor is about to leave, and one will not get treatment for illness. The chemist shop might close down, or perhaps one does not even exist in the area so that one cannot buy medicine. One might find a doctor but have to travel another 20 miles for medicine. That is no good. People will not stay in such an area, where they cannot even post a letter or send children to school, where there is no help from marauding criminals because there are no garda&iacute; there. That is the vicious circle of rural depopulation and loss of services. The same vicious circle exists in inner-city Dublin, driving people out of the city centre. The city then loses its heart, and people go to the suburbs &mdash; maybe not the leafy suburbs, but somewhere else.</P>
      <P>There is life on the other hand where people are involved, and where there are services. That is why I welcome the potential in the Grange<Col N="1127"/>gorman plan. I hope that great potential is realised.</P>
      <P>The DIT in Dublin is the biggest educational facility in Ireland. The RTC in Castlebar has meant a great deal to us in terms of infrastructure. It has drawn industry to the area. There is research going on there. There is a school of nursing, and so on. All these elements would not be there without the RTC. Science Foundation Ireland also carries out research. People were forgetting about these aspects.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Government continues to support the GMIT in Castlebar. I am very impressed with the DIT in Dublin. It is logical that it would be centralised. I know decentralisation of the health service is under way but in the case of the DIT the centralisation is justified. There will be economies of scale when all the campuses are brought together. This is a wonderful opportunity to have a St. Brendan&rsquo;s village in Dublin, and a number of them. There is a great opportunity in Grangegorman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill is a very important step in bringing to reality the wonderful decision taken by the Government in December 1999 that the Department of Education and Science would purchase 55 acres of the 73-acre Grangegorman site from the Eastern Regional Health Authority to provide a new campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>This is a very positive Bill, providing an exciting future for the DIT, for third level education and for all of the students of the future who will benefit greatly from the wonderful new education facility that will be the result of the work of the agencies to be established under the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule lists 22 different locations in the city of Dublin regarding properties of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is a total of 39 buildings on 30 sites currently providing third level education through the DIT. The final outcome of the legislation will be to see the 22,000 students and staff from these 39 different buildings moving to a new facility on a single campus at an excellent location on the north side of the city.</P>
      <P>I felt it was important I should contribute to this debate on behalf of the very many students from south County Meath and their families who are participating in third level education courses throughout the present 39 buildings, and on behalf of the County Meath students of the future who will be among the beneficiaries of the legislation. There is no doubt that the change to a single campus will provide a whole new centre of excellence to build on the wonderful educational tradition of the Dublin Institute of Technology and its predecessors under the City of Dublin VEC in their 123-year history in the provision of third level education.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years, the institute has experienced record numbers of applications for places. <Col N="1128"/>Despite the space restrictions imposed on it, the institute has continued to educate graduates to a unique level of expertise, which has great importance for industry and provides benefits in terms of the ongoing growth of the economy, with special emphasis on science and technology and hotel and catering. With far more efficient use of space provided by this unique opportunity to design a new campus on the Grangegorman site, huge benefits lie ahead for students in terms of the optimisation of resources in areas such as the co-ordination of research and the sharing of facilities and equipment across multidisciplinary teams. With the development of the new single campus, the provision for growth and new opportunities and increased student numbers are obvious.</P>
      <P>The changes to which I refer will be of major benefit to those involved in education. The development of Grangegorman will be wonderful for the local community and for the students of the future. A move away from the current situation, with the DIT&rsquo;s operations spread across scattered buildings, with their inherent lack of space and suitable infrastructure &mdash; I refer to the seven administrative offices, seven examination halls, seven libraries and ten canteens &mdash; will provide obvious benefits in operational effectiveness and savings in terms of administration, inter-communications and support services for future students.</P>
      <P>Establishing the agency is the first important step that will follow the passage of the legislation. The agency will be the sole authority for the development of the site at Grangegorman. It will also be responsible for the generation of income for that development. Included in this will be the sale or development of existing campuses, many of which are valuable premises within walking distance of the city centre. As Deputy Carey and others stated, there is no doubt that many of these premises are historic in nature and are situated on key city centre sites. Their sale and redevelopment will transform large sections of Dublin&rsquo;s city centre.</P>
      <P>DIT properties will be signed over to the agency as they become available. The agency will then dispose of them and the income generated will be used, together with other resources, to fund the project at Grangegorman. The Department estimates that the value of the property to be disposed of and savings on rental costs will generate &euro;250 million and probably a great deal more. This money will help to offset the capital costs of locating on the new campus. It is interesting to consider the current cost of rental, which alone amounts to over &euro;4.15 million per annum. Economies will obviously be made through savings on rental costs and these will be added to day-to-day operational savings and efficiencies.</P>
      <P>It is important to welcome the fact that approximately eight acres of the site at Grangegorman are intended for the development of <Col N="1129"/>health care facilities. I welcome, in particular, the proposals to provide residential and day care for people with intellectual disabilities, young people with physical disabilities and elderly people who suffer dementia. Deputy Fitzpatrick outlined the history of St. Brendan&rsquo;s which is the oldest public psychiatric hospital in the country. At one stage it had 2,000 clients but now it only has in the region of 400. The refocusing of the St. Brendan&rsquo;s campus, including the move from institutional to community settings, will provide a more appropriate environment for people availing of the services. This is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>On-site co-operation between health and education providers will obviously be important for both. However, it will also provide major benefits for students and service users. I would like every effort to be made to explore avenues of co-operation which could provide long-term benefits for clients, students and future professionals who will be located on the site.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the many County Meath students who attend DIT colleges and their families, I wish to state that the legislation is welcome because it provides the first important step in this process of establishing the agency that will carry out the planning and development of the new 65-acre campus on which DIT students of the future will be educated. I wish the agency well in its work. I hope it will be able to carry out its job efficiently and effectively in order that the new campus will be available to students at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and everybody involved to date. I wish continued success to this exciting project, which should be welcomed by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation for a number of reasons. I must declare a vested interest in that I live in the area in Aughrim Street which is situated 100 yards or so away from the Grangegorman site. It is a traditional area and includes Stoneybatter and Oxmantown. History has it that, because they were forbidden to cross the city, the Vikings settled there after the Battle of Clontarf. Indeed, the area is very much associated with history and folk memory. Whatever about the vandalism that happened during the period to which I refer, the general area is about to enter a more cultural and educational era.</P>
      <P>The second vested interest I must declare is that I have been involved with the City of Dublin VEC for many years. Like the Minister for Education and Science, I served as chair of the Cathal Brugha Street committee prior to the DIT&rsquo;s establishment in its current form. I was also a member of the Bolton Street committee and I subsequently served as chairman of the VEC after the legislation was introduced in 1990 or 1991 to divorce CDVEC from the new independent DIT. I have, therefore, a particular interest in the Bill, especially as I am aware of the needs of the DIT. The entire space, in terms of build<Col N="1130"/>ings, belonging to the institute covers approximately ten acres. The DIT is constrained in terms of what it can do with the space at its disposal. It is incredible that the institute&rsquo;s 39 buildings are squeezed on to 30 sites. It is amazing that the institute itself has operated so successfully in academic and educational terms over the years, particularly when one considers the enormous constraints placed upon it in a physical sense, with its buildings scattered across the north and south of the city.</P>
      <P>Everyone would welcome the opportunity for the DIT to consolidate its operations on a single campus and bring its faculties together. The new structure will bring the institute into the future in a coherent fashion and it will rid it of the fragmentation that exists at present. At present, the DIT pays over &euro;4 million annually in rental costs because a number of the buildings in which it operates do not belong to it. I do not see, for example, Mountjoy Square included on the list so I presume it and other buildings cannot be disposed of.</P>
      <P>It makes sense from every point of view for us to take the route outlined in the Bill. The proposals were initially made a short time after the establishment of the DIT on a statutory basis. The principals of the colleges at the time were anxious to provide a structure whereby student accommodation could be provided. The lack of a proper campus has bedevilled both the DIT and, before it, the VEC because student accommodation could not be provided in the city. This is despite the fact that it is the largest third level institution in the country. Now, however, all the faculties will be brought together in one location. These discussions went on throughout the 1990s and did not happen today or yesterday. The legislation was passed in 1991 and it was the DIT&rsquo;s objective since then to establish a unified campus for all its faculties. Collins Barracks was selected at one stage but it was turned into an excellent museum instead. The Grangegorman site was then promised to the DIT by the then Labour-Fianna F&aacute;il Government. The proposal has been at least ten years in gestation and it was only in recent times that it was formally implemented.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the general election in 2002, I was delighted to read a circular distributed by the Taoiseach to all the houses in the Oxmanstown-Grangegorman-Stoneybatter area in which he informed householders that the DIT was on the way and that the first footprint of the building would be in place by the end of 2002. That did not happen, but I was equally delighted to espy a similar circular, which had been distributed in the constituency on the eve of the local elections this year, informing us that the DIT legislation would be passed soon and the project would be up and running quickly. We are nearly there and I am delighted the legislation is being debated.</P>
      <P>I refer to the functions of the site. It is intended the site will be shared between the DIT and the Department of Health and Children, with the <Col N="1131"/>DIT getting 90% of the site and the Department getting approximately 10% for the provision of residential facilities. I tabled a number of parliamentary questions regarding the use of the site and I was informed that Educate Together, Dublin 7, would also be given a two or three acre site on the campus. Currently, the school does not have a permanent site. I would like the legislation to reflect this so that a primary level facility can be provided on the campus, as intended. Most public representatives in the area campaigned for such a facility and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science were contacted regarding the matter. In addition, parliamentary questions were tabled in this regard and I am surprised the legislation does not contain a commitment to an educational facility other than the DIT. I do not take away from the institute but it must be ensured a site is made available for Educate Together.</P>
      <P>Discussions also took place with Dublin City Council, which sought a portion of the site for social housing. The general tenor of the discussions was that housing would be provided for senior citizens. It should not be forgotten that is the final large site available in the north inner city. Half of the site, approximately 35 acres, comprises playing fields and other recreational facilities, which, presumably, will not be encroached upon, although we do not know what will happen in this regard.</P>
      <P>The final function of the site was to provide facilities for the local community. Throughout the process DIT representatives were excellent in engaging with the local community. They attended all the meetings that were organised with local people and they explained their intentions. They also put it on public record that they would seek to ensure the local community would have unlimited access to the lands and facilities provided in a generous and open fashion and that the facilities would be regarded as community-based.</P>
      <P>None of these functions is reflected in the legislation and I am concerned about this. I would like the Minister to accept an amendment to ensure these functions are fulfilled. Given that the debate is under way, all the groups to whom I referred will contact the Department of Education and Science, the DIT and the health board and public representatives to ensure each gets its piece of the cake, as expected following the discussions.</P>
      <P>Essentially the purpose of the site is to provide a home for the DIT and it will do so effectively because it is extremely important that the future of the DIT is assured. I have stated repeatedly that I would like another faculty added to the existing six DIT faculties. A police academy should be established on the site on the grounds that the Templemore training college is isolated in terms of the changes that have taken place in society and there is pressure on space. The Mini<Col N="1132"/>ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he would extend the current building in Templemore to provide the training facilities that are needed. While the Templemore facility should not be discarded entirely, new Garda recruits who otherwise will spend their time in a new, somewhat isolated extension in County Tipperary should have an opportunity to undergo some, if not all, of their training in an urban setting, in which 60% of the population resides. They are likely to spend most of their time on the beat where perhaps most of all they would have an opportunity of meeting their peers and receiving a broader education in that context. This would be a wonderful opportunity to add a further faculty to the DIT. It would allow for a police academy to be established there and for in-service courses to be provided. The Minister would be spared his proposed expansion in Templemore which is probably no longer the most suitable location for all Garda training. I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Bill proposes 11 members. It is obvious that a particular mechanism is being used. The Minister for Health and Children will nominate two members, the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology will nominate one member, and one member will be nominated by the city manager of Dublin City Council rather than by the members of Dublin City Council. It does not seem to me to be the most democratic and comprehensive list of members.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not depart very far from existing structures. The Dublin Docklands Development Authority has responsibility for the development of the docklands. It has both public and community representatives and other sectional interests. Its purpose is to ensure comprehensive, integrated development. Integrated area action plans exist across the city. One plan covers the north-east inner city east of O&rsquo;Connell Street while O&rsquo;Connell Street has a plan to itself and another plan covers the markets area. The idea behind these plans is to promote integrated development. The membership should reflect the local authority and community and other appropriate Government agencies. There should not be a departure from a model which involves both public and community representatives. The legislation would be more beneficial if it copied the model of agencies which are already in existence. The Minister may reply by saying that public and community representatives may be included in the 11 members but I do not think that is the intention. No entitlement exists and I suggest it should be stipulated in the legislation. I have no doubt the Minister will be given grief if community representation is not included in the legislation. It is a highly organised community with residents&rsquo; associations, the markets area representative organisation, the north-west inner city group, An S&iacute;ol and so on. Those groups are well organised and will look to ensure substantial gain for the community from this development as well <Col N="1133"/>as the professional educational and health services which will be provided.</P>
      <P>Section 20 mentions those with a consultative role such as the stakeholders and the local residents and public representatives. A bevy of people will have a consultative role, including no more than two members from each of the stakeholders appointed. This relegates public and community representatives to a second tier level of consultation and participation. If this was not the case in the docklands, I do not see why it should happen in the case of this agency. It would be better if a full-blooded agency or authority were established.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the changes I have recommended included in the legislation. I want to see full local participation in both the recreational and educational facilities. The DIT has done excellent work in this area by providing, in association with Hewlett Packard, computer facilities in a number of flat complexes. The institute is well embedded in the community and in a good position to build on that base. I want to see an integrated transport network developed using Broadstone Station and the line linking it with the Liffey valley which could be linked up to Maynooth and to the airport if it is done properly. An integrated system would be wonderful. I look forward to the enactment of this Bill. I hope to table amendments to deal with those suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Government&rsquo;s presentation of this Bill. I will first declare an interest. I am a former member of staff of the DIT and I was a member of a special strategy group established by the then president of the DIT, Dr. Goldsmith, to progress this proposal. The group was chaired by a former Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, Mr. Noel Lindsay, who has given great service by helping to develop this project to its current stage. I am also pleased to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of a number of distinguished members of the staff of the DIT, including the president of the DIT, Dr. Norton, and to welcome them. I know how important this project is to the thousands of staff who work in the DIT and who have been associated with the institute down the years. It is especially important to the many thousands of students whom the DIT has served during its history as the DIT and earlier when it was part of the City of Dublin VEC. This history goes back to the last years of the 19th century.</P>
      <P>This development has received a genuine, all-party welcome because it is an ideal which has been developed and progressed over many years. The DIT is Ireland&rsquo;s largest third level institution spread over a large number of locations throughout the city of Dublin. While that may have been satisfactory 20 years ago, it no longer meets the needs of today&rsquo;s third level requirements.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in this development. I was brought up in the area and I went to school adjacent to the site. As Members will be aware, <Col N="1134"/>the site had quite a sad history as being one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest mental institutions until the 1960s when the then head of Grangegorman, Dr. Ivor Browne, decided that it was appropriate, in respect of psychiatry, to break down the walls and help people who, until then, had been institutionalised for long periods in St. Brendan&rsquo;s hospital, get back into the community.</P>
      <P>I suppose this legislation is the end of that process in that while many of us have reservations about the way psychiatric patients fared in terms of community-based care, what is happening here is a positive development and a landmark occasion in terms of education.</P>
      <P>As a child I recall the odd moments I would day-dream out the window and see long, crocodile lines of patients walking aimlessly around the very large grounds of Grangegorman hospital. It should be remembered also that when Mother Mary Aikenhead founded the Sisters of Charity, one of the earliest institutions was located at Stanhope Street, which is just on the border of the site. That was one of the first institutions in the country to provide free education for girls. I was one of the people who benefited from that. My colleague, Deputy Costello, talked about the local community. I was probably the first woman from that community to get scholarships to go on to third level. With all the changes in Dublin the community has since prospered but there are still areas of deprivation there.</P>
      <P>The ethos of the Dublin Institute of Technology has been to open its doors to all-comers, people at the highest level of educational achievement and those returning to second-chance education or taking part in evening courses while working. The ethos of the DIT, through its various schools, has been to embrace almost every area of educational attainment and offer opportunities to students at every level of educational achievement, from those doing evening courses and undergraduate four-year degrees to people doing Ph.D. studies and research at the highest levels. The fact that the DIT comes to this campus with that history and ethos is important in terms of making a success of this development for the future of education in Dublin and the country.</P>
      <P>In that context, it is particularly appropriate that in the past year or two the DIT has developed a very successful degree in primary engineering, which is open to people who formerly would have done technician level courses but who now, through the DIT, can complete a degree. That is a fundamental development which greatly assists access to education and if that is the type of development the DIT undertakes on the new campus, it will be very welcome.</P>
      <P>The campus is an exciting opportunity in the heart of northside Dublin, as my colleague, Deputy Costello, said, to do something which represents the new century and new opportunities in education. The DIT has a distinguished school of architecture and I hope the occasion of <Col N="1135"/>the development of the campus will be an opportunity to marry this most historic site, with its occasionally sad history, with the status of the DIT engineering and architecture faculties and schools, and produce buildings of international showpiece quality on the site.</P>
      <P>With my colleague and local Deputy, Deputy Costello, the Taoiseach has taken a strong interest in this site over the years, as did the late Deputy Jim Mitchell. A characteristic we have in common is that we are all Dubliners from the centre of Dublin who did not come from particularly well-off backgrounds. I was thinking of the late Jim Mitchell when the Bill was published because he was one of the people who was very much in favour of the development of educational opportunity in north inner city Dublin.</P>
      <P>With my colleague I query the membership of the agency. I know the Minister will opt for the best available people to make up the membership because, as with the Docklands Authority and Temple Bar, that will be critical to the success of the project. There must be a mixture of people who understand the educational requirements of the project as well as, presumably, people with hands-on project management and business experience who can put such a complex deal together and have it completed on time.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the trade unions, including the TUI, which represents the staff, have asked to be involved in some capacity on the board of the agency. Given the positiveness with which the DIT community has met this proposal, I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to make provision for that.</P>
      <P>In terms of the needs of this country and of a knowledge-based economy, the driving purpose of this development should be about education and educational development. I realise some people may see it as an opportunity for property development but, inevitably, property development and the building of many buildings will be a critical, although not a primary, purpose of the project. We need to keep focused on the fact that this development will be a critical investment in third level education which, when completed, will mark Dublin for the next 100 years. Finding the right CEO and chairperson to manage the project, therefore, will be critical.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello spoke about his idea of locating a police academy on the site. This site is very close to two leading centres of legal education. The King&rsquo;s Inns is just across the road and the Law Society of Ireland, Blackhall Place, is about five minutes walk away. There is merit in Deputy Costello&rsquo;s idea because there is an imbalance in regard to policing education in that insufficient time is spent by trainee garda&iacute; in urban environments. It should be remembered that the training centre of the Garda, until the 1950s, was located very close by in the Phoenix Park, which is the current headquarters of the Garda. There is room for an imaginative initiative which would <Col N="1136"/>be hugely beneficial to the garda&iacute; as they face the problem of policing in an urban environment. That is one of their critical challenges.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind also that for many years the DIT has run excellent courses in law and criminology and has a highly regarded legal department, as well as many experts in sociology, urban design and the whole aspect of developing towns and cities. One can think of the imaginative marriage, so to speak, for the garda&iacute; in terms of having an integrated experience which would allow one to examine, for instance, key elements that lead to anti-social behaviour. Most Members talk about that problem, particularly in an urban context. This is an exciting opportunity for the DIT and it is something the Minister should examine.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>One area in which the DIT has specialised over the years is science education and development. Given that an insufficient number of students study science at third level and that this is a 70 acre campus &mdash; more if one adds the buildings around Broadstone &mdash; we could do something world class in terms of providing science facilities which would not only be for the use of research staff and students but which would also act as a focal point for younger children and schools in the greater Dublin area to encourage an interest in scientific education and training. There are interesting and exciting possibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>These plans will cost money. I note that initial provision is made in the Bill for drawing down funding and loans to the value of &euro;100 million or so. That is a great deal of money but given the ambitious scale of this project, I hope it is enough. The project has been a little slower in developing than we would have liked. A key element of the project is to recycle existing buildings in the DIT and use them to part fund the development. It is important that there be sufficient funds to complete this ambitious project within a reasonable period. It should be borne in mind that the DIT has a number of older campuses in Cathal Brugha Street, Bolton Street and Kevin Street. The Kevin Street premises need significant refurbishment and is the key faculty for the sciences in the DIT. We need a time based plan to ensure that this project is not excessively long-fingered.</P>
      <P>The project is close to Broadstone Station. On the Order of Business the Taoiseach said that he has recently been rethinking transport in Dublin. The metro appears to be off the menu. Broadstone Station is probably the largest, unutilised key transport facility in the Dublin area. A railway line runs through it and connects, via the tunnel under the Phoenix Park, with the Dublin-Cork line and Heuston Station and through the loop line with Connolly Station. It connects with every railway line in Ireland. For reasons best known to the Ministers for Transport and the board of CIE, it has lain unloved and unutilised for a long time.</P><Col N="1137"/>
      <P>Again, if there is a significant urban master plan for this development, re-utilising Broadstone as a key transport hub opens enormous possibilities not just for the daytime use of the Grangegorman site but also for its night-time use. This is in the medieval part of the city. The site is locked into a series of small roads so unless there is significant public transport access, particularly with the current policing situation on Dublin city streets, it would not be very attractive at night. However, if the transport links were properly developed in a master plan it could be the making of the site.</P>
      <P>The site is bounded at one side by Prussia Street and Manor Street which historically constitute one of the five great roads of Ireland. At present, the site is landlocked on the Prussia Street side. If the site were opened to that street, it would provide access to another approximately 15 bus routes which would reinforce the hub nature of the site for public transport access. That is the reason it is important that a first class master plan be drawn up for the site and that the site, from an architectural and transport links point of view, should be a landmark development for this century.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Labour Party will put forward a number of amendments. However, the Bill is an extremely positive development. The DIT, more than most Irish educational institutions, has developed a ladder system of education. In other words, it is possible to enter the DIT to study at different levels, for example, as a direct entrant from second level, on a part-time evening basis or short course basis, and through the accumulation of qualifications, credits and so forth to continue to PhD level, as the current professor of engineering in UCD did. I hope that tradition will not only continue but be expanded when the DIT finally locates to the campus in Grangegorman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I must first declare an interest. I am on leave of absence from my lectureship in the Dublin Institute of Technology. I also wish to point out that the views I express in this debate are my own and not those of the DIT.</P>
      <P>As an architect, urban designer and town planner, I am enthused and excited by the prospect of the development at Grangegorman. It is an incredible opportunity to create a new utopia in the heart of Dublin. It has incredible potential to transform the north-west inner city and the Dublin Institute of Technology. It also has the ability to transform people&rsquo;s lives in Dublin city. The opportunity in this part of the city is unparalleled in hundreds of years. It is a hugely significant step for the institution. I believe we can build an incredible addition to the city of Dublin in the heart of the city.</P>
      <P>We have had experience of that over recent years in the docklands, with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority carrying on the work started by the Irish Financial Services Centre. The Temple Bar project was a smaller <Col N="1138"/>attempt to create a sustainable community in the heart of Dublin. We can learn from the successes and failures of those projects.</P>
      <P>Over the last generation there has been a sea change in the way planners view development. In the 1960s, there was huge enthusiasm for the ideas of Le Corbusier, who believed it was possible to build a modern new city with strict zoning, increased provision for the automobile and segregation of different types of transport. He had a modern view of the city. I believe we have moved away from that view. We are more concerned with having a mixture of uses within a single area and allowing for a diversity of expression within a single neighbourhood. It is important that we learn from the latest ideas and from the best practice of new communities and areas being developed abroad.</P>
      <P>There is no dearth of ideas. There are fantastic new developments in education and in community development in places such as Barcelona and the Netherlands. We must learn from them. There is a danger that too much emphasis will be put on the educational aspect in the development of Grangegorman. I believe it should be a more mixed community. There should be housing not only for students but also the panorama of housing that we wish to provide through our housing policy, that is, social housing, affordable housing, student housing and private housing. Only that can ignite the tinder flame of making this into a sustainable community.</P>
      <P>It is only if we get that mix that we can truly say the development of Grangegorman is of tremendous value and benefit to the wider city. However, we have this opportunity to create a utopia. First and foremost, we need a master plan which must be carefully drawn up in full consultation with the surrounding communities, the unions and all possible stakeholders to the development. There was an early draft plan which had more in common with the kind of planning ethos that gave us Belfield in the 1960s than the kind of ethos necessary for a new development in the heart of an existing community in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The new development must relate to the surrounding community and must break through the walls. I am conscious of how, for instance, the National College of Ireland takes as its motto, &ldquo;breaking down the walls&rdquo;. Grangegorman has exactly the same capacity to do this. It will have to break down the walls and make use of strategic opportunities if it is to come out onto Prussia Street, Manor Street and the surrounding roads, including the North Circular Road. Such opportunities exist and will have to be seized to make a first class campus.</P>
      <P>It is not about building new roads but new streets. It is about an urban language and a topology that ties into the kind of medium density development that characterises the new Dublin. However, this must be undertaken sensitively and must liaise and take account of the local com<Col N="1139"/>munity as partners and stakeholders and must provide for them as well as the wider needs of the institution.</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of knowledge. In Kevin Kearns&rsquo;s fantastic book, <i>Stoneybatter: Dublin&rsquo;s Inner-Urban Village</i>, this American sociologist has written with incredible insight on how the north inner city works. His views can aid the process of development. This process must reflect the urban grain of the inner city, must tie in the edges and should consider carefully the assets on site at present. One month ago, I had the pleasure of playing football with the sports against racism in Ireland initiative. When one stands on the playing fields at Grangegorman, one can see what a remarkable asset it is. If the gently sloping site was in slightly warmer climes, I am sure there would be vineyards on it, sloping towards the River Liffey, with the Dublin and Wicklow hills in the distance. All these opportunities must be seized and the existing strengths of the existing buildings, many of which are protected structures, must be fostered. The flora and fauna on site must be carefully examined and taken into account in the design process.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to transport issues in the area, which must be carefully considered. While Broadstone depot is a stone&rsquo;s throw away, there is huge uncertainty in regard to the Government&rsquo;s future plans for public transport. A huge stalling process is under way in this regard but it is crucial that public transport is at the heart of this development. We do not need surface car parks and we should be careful of building multi-storey car parks. I recently visited the Helix at Dublin City University and it is more of a &ldquo;Blade Runner&rdquo; scenario than a university campus should be. We should look at Harvard&rsquo;s campus in Cambridge, Boston, at Columbia University in New York and at the kind of campuses that allow the people of a city to pass through. To have a campus without walls is crucial. It must be a 24-hour community. We cannot allow the students to disappear and we cannot allow the campus simply to be an educational institution.</P>
      <P>I am incredibly enthused about this project and about the capacity of the Dublin Institute of Technology to act as a focus for the ongoing development of Dublin&rsquo;s inner city. The institution has an incredible capacity to interact with the working class communities of Dublin, the new communities of Dublin and those who have moved into the inner city in recent years. One fact I bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention is that the second most spoken language in Stoneybatter at present is Chinese. Stoneybatter has a huge immigrant community and Dublin 7 has probably the strongest immigrant community on the island. Links must be made there. Most of that community are here to study English and the DIT can work out ways of building on the strengths of that group.</P><Col N="1140"/>
      <P>The master plan is crucial. It should go out to a public competition, a process that worked well for Temple Bar. The master plan process was very important in regard to the docklands. What docklands stage two has learned from the IFSC is that not to have the local community on board is to miss out on a huge asset. This is why docklands stage two is working better. We need to apply this kind of thinking to developments at Grangegorman.</P>
      <P>With my colleague, Deputy Gogarty, I look forward to engaging with the Bill on Committee Stage. It is one of the most interesting opportunities for Dublin&rsquo;s inner city in many years. It is certainly a make or break opportunity for the DIT. I wish the Bill well and hope to comment in further detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill whose purpose is to relocate the various colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology, of which there are perhaps 40 in all, to an extensive and major new campus at Grangegorman. While I approve of the way the action is being taken, I am concerned it could have implications for other psychiatric hospital grounds throughout the country. There is a danger a precedent could be set. That the land is not to be sold is welcome but the development raises the issue of the sale of such lands. The media is reporting the matter with regard to the value of the lands and how much can be made from their sale. However, if all went well and &euro;1 billion was made, this would be only 10% of the health budget. It would solve some difficulties in terms of the current budget but, in the long term, the assets would be gone. We should think carefully before considering the sale of such lands. The type of development proposed for Grangegorman, with colleges or health offices moving into facilities, is the way we should be moving in other areas.</P>
      <P>The new campus will be located side by side with purpose-built facilities to cater for the intensive rehabilitative needs of patients, including those with mental illness. The mentally ill will be integrated into college life to some extent and a village format will be developed. It is also envisaged to develop custom-built primary care facilities, day care and residential care for the elderly and those with special needs, which is to be welcomed and what the campus should be about. I understand that a palliative care day unit will also be developed in collaboration with St. Francis Hospice, Raheny. These facilities are perfectly in keeping with the ethos of St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital in Grangegorman up to now, which was to keep abreast of international trends, to decentralise the delivery of psychiatric care services from large institutional settings to multidisciplinary community services and to move towards the development of acute psychiatric services in general hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that treatment methods in the psychiatric services have changed signifi<Col N="1141"/>cantly and we are witnessing new ways of delivering services. In the past, most patients were treated in hospital. The emphasis in my area was to split counties Cavan and Monaghan into four community sector areas with a community day centre in each headquarters from where services were delivered. Greater emphasis was also put on visiting patients in their homes through community and domiciliary services. The idea now is to get staff out of hospital and to provide services in the home. Staff take responsibility for a number of patients, give them attention in their homes and, therefore, reduce the need to have patients in hospital settings. That is the way services are going. It will mean that many of the psychiatric services will be freed up, which is to be welcomed. This new emphasis began in 1984 when the Department of Health, as it was known then, published its planning for the future report. In the mid-1980s, St. Brendan&rsquo;s had an inpatient population of 900. Today, there are only 140 inpatients, excluding those residing in community houses. In the St. Davnet&rsquo;s complex 25 years ago there were approximately 600 patients. Now there are approximately 40 patients, mainly geriatric patients.</P>
      <P>Acute provision is now mainly transferred to general hospital settings arising from the considerable planning and development that took place over the last ten years. The theory is that treatment for mental or physical illness should be carried out in a general hospital building. However, occasionally in practice this can be carried too far. A patient admitted to hospital can often be in a disinhibited state. Is it fair to bring him or her into the general hospital system when he or she is not at his or her best? The location of acute units in general hospitals is often not in the best areas. I know of one located in the lower ground floor of the hospital. The idea is simply to locate the acute unit somewhere in the general hospital, which is not always right. For acute patients a good area is needed with lovely grounds and trees where patients can walk around, allowing them to recover from their illnesses in dignity and privacy. The notion of the general hospital at all costs must be re-examined. If not, then hospitals should be located in leafy green areas.</P>
      <P>Some 16 years ago, there was a fantastic day care facility in the centre of Cavan town. However, it was moved to a hospital one mile out of the town centre. Before this, it was a much sought after facility and an example of how services could be brought to a community. The relocation was a reversal and at the time I believed it was wrong. The more services that can be located within the community, the better. For many years, the existing buildings in St. Brendan&rsquo;s have been in need of modernisation. This presents the ideal opportunity to provide state-of-the-art facilities for the 21st century. However, St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital is more than 100 years old and not much money has been spent on it. It is <Col N="1142"/>institutional which does not send out a good signal but provides a good media story on conditions in the health services. To some extent part of this will be left behind. The institutional face of these type of buildings will slowly break down.</P>
      <P>The move by the Dublin Institute of Technology to Grangegorman is reminiscent of the relocation of UCD from its various scattered facilities around Dublin city to Belfield in the 1970s. It had major consequences for UCD when it moved from Earlsfort Terrace as it had been based there for 100 years. It was very traumatic for staff and students. The engineering block containing Leinster House offices was a UCD building. Some will argue it is now put to much better use. UCD has progressed significantly since the days the late John Feeney welcomed Archbishop John Charles McQuaid to the campus with snowballs.</P>
      <P>The subdivision of the Grangegorman site into a modern third level campus with custom-built medical facilities is preferable to any suggestion to sell off hospital lands for development. These lands are often central and valuable and developers have their eyes on acquiring them. This merely serves to enrich developers in the short term while health services agencies concurrently lease premises in a variety of locations. I have great difficulty with how public service organisations, particularly health boards, lease premises. When I sat on the North Eastern Health Board, the finance officer continually put forward proposals to rent property. I saw the health board tying itself into contracts costing in excess of &euro;1 million for five-year terms. Good public money is being poured down the sink. A system must be put in place where, for the same expenditure of money, a public service agency can buy its own property. In the long term, whether it is ten or 20 years, it will have the asset of the bricks and mortar at the same cost as leasing it. The Government must change the law to allow health boards to enter into purchase agreements. Selling off the family silverware by leasing premises amounts to a haemorrhage of public funds and is a classic example of false economy.</P>
      <P>A classic example is St. Davnet&rsquo;s Hospital complex at Rooskey, County Monaghan, which has been utilised to provide a range of social, educational and community facilities. In recent years, it has accommodated a Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training centre, a nursing home, a theatre, local health services office, servicing counties Monaghan and Cavan, a births, marriages and deaths registration office, two hostels, a swimming pool, Monaghan Harps club complex and a breast screening facility. Where is the logic in having a scarcity of room at Monaghan General Hospital while there are ample facilities in the St. Davnet&rsquo;s complex? Can the administrative facilities of the general hospital be transferred to another location? Can the laundry or pathology departments, for example, be relocated? In the St. Davnet&rsquo;s <Col N="1143"/>example, acres of space could be used for this purpose. Meanwhile, in Cavan General Hospital, one of the main difficulties is space for the accident and emergency unit, where recently 29 people were on trolleys. This is a rural hospital that did not have much experience with trolleys three years ago. Instead of setting up committees to examine selling lands, they should be focused on considering the need for this type of space. St. Davnet&rsquo;s is a perfect example of using hospital facilities to their optimum capacity.</P>
      <P>The transformation of the Grangegorman site will add to its international prestige. A number of years ago, films were made on the site. As Deputy Cuffe said, it is a beautiful site and ideally situated for the Dublin Institute of Technology. The proposed complex will be a major factor in the regeneration of a large segment of north Dublin, including Phibsborough and Broadstone. The total cost of the project is estimated at &euro;750 million, of which the Government will contribute &euro;200 million. Redeveloping the Grangegorman site can be classified as the provision of infrastructure in the revitalisation of the 70-acre site close to the inner city. This would represent excellent value for money since previously derelict areas would be revived. The DIT would be responsible for the provision of 73% of the costs from various fund-raising and revenue generating activities.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science recently put a dampener on the further development and evolution of the DIT by declaring last May that the transfer to Grangegorman would not mean the DIT would be granted university status. In this momentous move for the DIT to a single integrated campus where it will achieve a new identity while retaining the best features of its past, the icing on the cake would be the achievement of university status. The DIT has long sought university status, and it would be appropriate that with the consolidation of all its facilities in a single location, it should take its place as the country&rsquo;s next university.</P>
      <P>Professor Malcolm Skilbeck recommended the granting of university status to the DIT with a clear industrial and technological mission, thereby introducing a new type of university. He said the current deep divide between the seven universities and the institutes of technology only serves to inhibit creativity and innovation.</P>
      <P>University status for the DIT would reflect the pressing need for more graduates as we move towards a more highly-skilled and knowledge-based economy. It would provide much greater flexibility for the DIT and would allow it to respond to the educational needs of students and industry in a positive and constructive way. It would enable the institute to develop further its own distinct ethos and tradition. Many people would not otherwise have gained access to third level education were it not for the DIT.</P><Col N="1144"/>
      <P>The former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, recommended that consideration be given to the granting of university status to the DIT. During her tenure in office, a review group recommended that the DIT be granted authority to award degrees in respect of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses with effect from the academic year 1998-99. However, the Higher Education Authority rejected this proposal, even though the DIT had made a strong case for inclusion in the Universities Act 1996 which provided a statutory mechanism for the recognition of third level institutions as universities.</P>
      <P>It would be reasonable if funding for the Eastern Regional Health Authority were to be made available from the transfer of land to the DIT for investment in health facilities. The DIT is doing well out of this deal and it would also be fair for some consideration to be given to making a financial contribution for health purposes.</P>
      <P>As far as the Grangegorman site is concerned, the importance of providing transport access is a crucial issue that cannot be stressed enough since the site is effectively landlocked. Public transport access must be considered in the context of an integrated urban design and land use plan. Such a plan, similar to a feasibility study, would include proposals for community use and access with a high quality urban design perspective. It would also be essential that it would complement the character of the neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>The CIE site at Broadstone is adjacent to Grangegorman and, given that there would be a Luas or metro link with the new Grangegorman development, it would make eminent sense that any planned development of the CIE site at Broadstone should be integrated with the development of the Grangegorman site from the viewpoints of greater flexibility, improved access and financial return to the State.</P>
      <P>The Government recently announced the national spatial strategy. Part of the development of this strategy included the selection of greenfield sites in towns. In many cases large psychiatric hospitals can provide the necessary level of greenfield sites. We should re-examine how we can devolve Departments outside Dublin as the greenfield sites are available and this would be a fantastic way of addressing the matter. In most respects, general hospitals are located adjacent to psychiatric hospitals which would fulfil the national spatial strategy requirement of general hospital access in every area. I ask that consideration be given to this and not just to overcome short-term financing difficulties. We should hold on to what we have and not sell off the silverware. It can pay dividends in future and it would be a tragedy to look at financing ourselves out of trouble by selling off these lots of land. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contribution to the Bill. I am not sure if any other educational institute in the country can claim to have had the <Col N="1145"/>range of interests expressed here. By my reckoning, we have had three board members, three lecturers, two parents and one full-time student. I forgot to say at the outset that I was a part-time DIT student when I did the diploma in legal studies. Other institutes might claim to have more graduates or more parents but I do not think we would get the diversity we heard here today.</P>
      <P>I can only hope future legislative initiatives I bring to the House as Minister for Education will be as welcomed as this particular Bill, but I am not so naive to expect that will be the case. It is very encouraging that all sides of the House have acknowledged the importance not only of this legislation in setting up the agency but have also recognised the role and importance of the DIT and its educational value throughout the country and not just in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the senior members of the DIT who are in the Visitors Gallery and I too welcome them. I also thank them for their interest, involvement and help in progressing this legislation, of which I am aware through my involvement as Chief Whip.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies from the constituency in which Grangegorman is located have spoken on this matter. The legislation would not be discussed here today if it were not for the personal interest of the Taoiseach who has been the driving force behind this initiative. Of all the local TDs who are all very interested in it, he genuinely wants to see this happen. He wants to see the development for the good of the educational institute but, especially for the good of the local area. As other Deputies stated, the Grangegorman site has immense potential. It has tremendous potential for the students of this illustrious body, DIT staff, health facilities as referred to by Deputy Connolly, and the involvement of the entire local community. While most speakers focused on the educational side of the development, he stressed the health aspects. We hope to progress the establishment of the agency quickly on foot of finalising the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised various issues that can be summarised under a number of headings. These include membership of the agency, commercial on-site activities, student accommodation, accessibility and transport needs in conjunction with transport bodies and Dublin City Council, community involvement, the role of local representatives, political input and the participation of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>If we were to take on board all the suggestions made as to what should be included on the site ranging from public housing, health facilities and educational facilities, we would need to include the redevelopment of the area up to O&rsquo;Connell Street. As I said, the site is a substantial one and there is great scope for us to do all the things people have asked.</P>
      <P>I wish to address some specific issues regarding the site itself. A number of Deputies, including Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan who is present, asked if there <Col N="1146"/>was a danger that parts of the site would be sold off for commercial or industrial activity. There is no intention to sell of any part of the site for such purposes. All commercial activity will be linked directly to the education centre, perhaps in the form of the enterprise incubator units where research facilities will be based, and research activities ancillary to the health services or the wider education services. Nothing will be sold off for that purpose. It will all be directly linked to it.</P>
      <P>Student accommodation on a campus enlivens the campus and the area. By keeping people there through the evening and night, greater use is made of the sporting or social facilities and this will be an important part of the development of Grangegorman. The Dublin Institute of Technology proposes to include student accommodation on campus. It is confident that by being on one site and having a stronger identity than at present, it will be able to lever private funding, not just for student accommodation but also for other academic activities on site, and I wish it well with that. Student accommodation will be an integral part of the site.</P>
      <P>Deputies from the area raised the issue of community links but all welcomed the Bill and will play a major role in progressing it as we go through Committee and Report Stages. The Dublin Institute of Technology has been to the fore in including programmes for disadvantaged students and ensuring access and involvement in its various colleges throughout the city. We pay tribute to it for that. The computer skills programme in the flat complexes working with Hewlett Packard was mentioned, and there has been a great deal more such activity. I recently gave a lunchtime talk in St. Thomas&rsquo; church in Cathal Brugha Street where traditionally I participated in the conferring ceremony. It was strange to be back in a different capacity in the little Church of Ireland. The college provided the lunchtime soup and sandwiches free of charge. That is a simple example of the type of co-operation in which the institute has been involved. It is anxious to strengthen and build on those links at its new campus in Grangegorman.</P>
      <P>Deputies proposed various ideas about the transportation strategy, the need or otherwise for car parking space, opening Broadstone railway station and the kind of links needed. It will be critical. Students will come from throughout the country. Many will stay locally while others will stay around the city. For that reason the Bill provides for consultation with various transport providers. Whereas initial contact has been made with the relevant Departments and State authorities, it will be a priority of the agency to pursue access and transport issues with the institute. It will not be needed for a few years but planning must take place now.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the issues raised about the membership of the agency. I have begun to examine that and will have completed it before Committee Stage. The involvement of the Dublin <Col N="1147"/>Institute of Technology struck me as an area to consider. Some mentioned the role of public representatives on the agency. It is true that sometimes we rule ourselves out of activities about which we know most and public representatives can play a significant role, as we have seen in the contributions today. The Taoiseach too has played a role in progressing this. I am conscious also of the local community. The agency allows for the Minister to have several members so there are mechanisms for ensuring that we can have representation, but I will strengthen that in a more defined way on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is the initial stage of the project in that we are talking only about setting up the agency, but that is crucial in determining the future of that body. The Government has committed approximately &euro;200 million for phase one of the amalgamation. The value of the properties which the institute holds throughout the city cannot be underestimated. Those properties will be vested in the agency which can use them to provide financing for subsequent phases of the project. The Department of Finance believes this project will be self-financing. We will wait and see. There is great potential for the development of this area of the city and it is the right type of development. By involving education, health, sport and leisure facilities and the community it will kick-start the development of the area.</P>
      <P>I am less sure about Deputy Costello&rsquo;s suggestion to locate the Garda training college on the campus. He mentioned that it is located in Templemore in Tipperary which is very isolated. As somebody who comes from a place nine miles down the road from Templemore, I must say it is far from isolated. That is not to deny that the legal department in the Dublin Institute of Technology is very good but the work in the training college in Templemore is equally good and is internationally recognised.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the potential is great as the complex develops in the future. There is potential for educational and commercial development and for job opportunities, all of which is true of the sites being vacated as well. The project offers scope for imaginative development in this part of the city. The agency will be able to draw on the expertise and knowledge of a wide range of interests. It will be of value to the Dublin Institute of Technology, the local community, the city as a whole and ultimately the country. On a day when we acknowledge and celebrate 150 years of University College Dublin, it is opportune that we talk about the largest institute of technology which will soon commence its move to a single site.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill to the House and thank the Deputies for their contributions. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il le bheith ag obair le Teachta&iacute; ar an gc&eacute;ad Ch&eacute;im eile den Bille.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am glad at least to have the opportunity to commence this important Bill even though there is little time left to discuss it. The Bill represents the fourth legislative initiative on traffic law in the past two years. One of those initiatives introduced a new legislative code for the control and regulation of small public service vehicles while the others were targeted on issues that effect road safety. The road safety theme also provides the general policy background and framework for this proposed legislation. The immediate focus of the Bill is to support the introduction of a new system of speed limits based on metric values. Compliance with speed limits is of paramount importance in the achievement of the type of driver behaviour that promotes a safe travelling environment on our roads. Road safety also underpins a specific proposal that I am promoting for the application of a prohibition on the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to minors. The Bill provides for a number of other initiatives. These relate mainly to the introduction of amendments to the legislation for the administration of the fixed charge and penalty points systems introduced under the Road Traffic Act 2002, which focus in particular on outsourcing certain functions from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to fixed charge payments. The Bill provides for a number of changes to the Taxi Regulation Act 2002, which will assist in the operation of certain key provisions contained in that Act.</P>
      <P>In my new role as Minister for Transport, I will continue to afford road safety the highest priority and will maintain the focus of our policy on the key areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt <Col N="1149"/>wearing to reduce deaths and injuries. Achieving a world-class performance in road safety requires a range of effective policies to ensure safe interaction between vehicles, drivers and other road users. The Government is addressing all of these issues. Of course, road safety is ultimately about the behaviour of road users. Over the past six years there has been a distinct improvement in our road safety performance. This has been underpinned by the fact that the period also featured the launch and implementation of the first national road safety strategy. The pace of that improvement accelerated since the end of 2002 following the introduction of the penalty points system. The system was initially applied for speeding offences with effect from the end of October 2002.</P>
      <P>In the period from November 2002 to the end of October this year the number of road deaths fell from 811 to 693 when compared with the previous 24 months. This means that 118 people are alive today who might otherwise have been victims of road collisions. The downward trend in fatalities continued in 2003 when we recorded the lowest number of fatalities, 336, since 1963. The need for constant vigilance and attention has been clearly shown since the beginning of this year. As of last Monday the number of road deaths this year was 25 higher than was the case over the same period last year. However, the number of road deaths in the first ten months of this year is the second lowest figure since 1998, which was the first full year of the first road safety strategy.</P>
      <P>The successor to that initial strategy was published recently. Its primary target is to realise a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998 to 2003 period. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. Given the progress that we have made over the past six years, the target we have set is very ambitious. However, the measures set out in the strategy can help us to revert to the position we experienced in 2003. The policy focus pursued over the past six years is working. The effect of the penalty points system has given a particular impetus to that policy and there is now a greater awareness of road safety generally and a desire and expectation that that impetus will not be lost. The collective goal of all those involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety policies is to ensure that the improvements achieved over the past six years are sustained and built on.</P>
      <P>The strategy will build on the success of its predecessor, the results of a review of that strategy carried out by an international expert in road safety and the further improvements realised in 2003. Achieving a reduction of 25% is a very ambitious target. The degree of that ambition can be judged against the background of the overall EU target of realising a 50% reduction in road deaths over a ten year period and the target set <Col N="1150"/>in the United States, which provides for a reduction of one third in fatalities per vehicle kilometre travelled over an eight-year period. In setting our goals for the period up to the end of 2006, we are supported by the knowledge that the strategic approach adopted has been shown to deliver the greatest benefits in the long term. The most successful countries in the European Union in delivering reductions in road casualty numbers on a sustained basis are those that have adopted such an approach.</P>
      <P>In adopting our road safety strategy we learned from the experience of states like the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which are the leading states in the European Union in road safety performance. We have also adopted an approach that has seen the engagement of all the organisations that contribute to the various elements of road safety policy in the identification and pursuit of the policies through which the overall targets can be achieved. The first road safety strategy to cover the period 1998-2002 set a primary target of a 20% reduction in deaths and serious injuries. This was achieved in the case of deaths and surpassed in the case of serious injuries. However, progress in particular key areas was mixed. We did not achieve the level of improvements targeted in the area of drink driving and speed limit compliance. Progress was made in seat belt wearing rates but there is significant room for further improvement.</P>
      <P>One area where we made significant progress was in the target to introduce specific accident reduction measures on 400 locations on the national road network. This was surpassed with 418 schemes completed by the end of 2002. In addition, good progress has been made in the implementation of the overall national roads upgrade programme provided for in the national development plan. To date 44 projects have been completed, with a total of 310 km, including 76 km of motorway and 233 km of dual carriageway standard. In addition, work is under way on 20 projects totalling 203 km, including 157 km to motorway-dual carriageway standard, while another eight projects with a total of 58 km are at tender stage. The position on the five major inter-urban routes is that at the end of 2003 nearly 30% of these routes had been upgraded to motorway-dual carriageway standard with work under way on approximately another 12%. This ensures that priority is given to addressing the need for urban bypasses and dealing with traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. Influencing such behaviour positively is at the centre of our road safety programmes and forms the primary focus of our road safety strategies. Behaviour is influenced positively through initiatives across a number of areas. One of these is the promulgation and enforcement of laws that promote road user behaviour. Such laws must also be underpinned and supported by the application of <Col N="1151"/>fines, prison sentences and driving disqualifications that collectively create an appropriate deterrent to those who endanger the lives of others by their failure to acknowledge and comply with the appropriate behavioural norms. Equally, legislation must evolve to influence and respond to changing driving cultures, which are of themselves influenced by improved road infrastructure and vehicle engineering. The ongoing improvements in our road network have been a significant contributing factor in our improved road safety performance. These improvements have presented challenges for road traffic legislation, especially in relation to the speed limit structures that we apply.</P>
      <P>The need to ensure that our speed limit structures are consistent with our improved road network and that they retain their central focus on safety prompted the decision to have a comprehensive review of the current speed limits carried out last year. The immediate background to the review was that a determination had been made that we should proceed to the adoption of metric values for our speed limits. It had been envisaged that the full metrication of speed limits and the traffic signs that depict them would be completed by the end of this year and regulations were made to that end under EU Council Directive 89/617/EEC. It was decided in September to push the changeover to metric speed limits forward to 20 January 2005 so that a comprehensive and concentrated public information campaign on metrication would not lose impact during the distractions of the December and new year festive season. A metrication changeover board has been appointed to plan and oversee the implementation of the changeover from imperial to metric speed limits within the 20 January 2005 timeframe. To facilitate that plan, it must be supported by the early passage of the legislation necessary to provide support for the new system.</P>
      <P>The limited operation to date of the fixed charge and penalty points system has shown that there is scope for the outsourcing of elements of the systems so as to relieve the administrative pressures on the Garda and to introduce greater clarity to the role of the Courts Service in the operation of the penalty points system. Therefore, the Bill contains relevant provisions to support those initiatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue of child care. I support the amended motion fully. The original motion, which was tabled by Deputies from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, fails to acknowledge any of the Government&rsquo;s many developments and achievements in respect of child care since 1997. I will outline some of the developments in the short time available to me.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s support for the development of privately owned child care facilities, for example by making capital tax incentives available for expenditure on the construction of a building for use as a child care facility. I understand that a tax incentive is also available for expenditure on the conversion of existing buildings to child care facilities. It should be noted that employees who avail of free or subsidised child care facilities provided by employers are exempt from benefit in kind charges in that regard. I understand that this exemption was introduced in the Finance Act 1997.</P><Col N="1157"/>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There has been a significant level of increase in child benefit payments in recent years. The monthly payment currently stands at over &euro;131 for each of the first two children and at over &euro;165 for third and subsequent children. It should be noted that the rate of increase of the payment has been far in excess of the rate of inflation and, as such, is enjoyed by parents as a real and significant increase.</P>
      <P>I do not have enough time to discuss all the research which was conducted in this area, for example by expert working groups, before the equal opportunities child care programme was finalised. It should be acknowledged that the work of such groups has resulted in a comprehensive programme. The main objectives of the programme, which was launched as part of the national development plan, were to improve the quality of child care, to increase the number of child care facilities and places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services. The funding which has been made available through the programme is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to child care. The &euro;317 million which was originally made available under the programme was subsequently increased following transfers from other Departments and the increase in funding which resulted from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The total fund over the seven years of the programme now stands at approximately &euro;450 million.</P>
      <P>Funding from the equal opportunities child care programme is available to finance different aspects of child care provision. Capital grant assistance is available to create new and enhanced child care facilities and staffing grants are available to assist with the staffing costs of child care facilities which support disadvantaged parents who are in employment. Community based and not-for-profit groups can avail of capital grant assistance of up to 100% and private providers can avail of grant assistance of up to &euro;50,790 towards the cost of developing new facilities. It should be remembered that community based and not-for-profit groups which provide services for disadvantaged families may receive grant assistance towards their staffing costs to enable them to support parents who cannot afford the full cost of child care. The programme has been a great success. Over &euro;220 million has been allocated in capital and staffing grants paid to community based and not-for-profit groups and private providers. It was originally estimated that the programme would create over 28,000 new child care places, but the figure is set to exceed 31,000 following the increase in funding.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asked me early this summer to attend a conference in &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in in Clondalkin. The conference, which focused on child care, involved many community based groups in Clondalkin and Tallaght which provide child care facilities. While there was a wide and far-reaching discussion, the <Col N="1158"/>major concern of most of the contributors to the debate was what will be put in place after the equal opportunities child care programme has finished.</P>
      <P>I have outlined many of the Government&rsquo;s initiatives which have greatly enhanced child care facilities, but I would like to conclude by outlining a concern, which I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to pass on to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Government should examine urgently the policies and programmes which will be put in place when the existing equal opportunities child care programme expires. Those who currently benefit from the programme are entitled to a degree of certainty about policies and future funding. My major concern does not relate to the work we have done to date, but to how we will proceed. I ask the Minister of State to relay my concerns to his colleagues with responsibility for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate, which is timely in the run-up to the budget. I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in for proposing this motion, which relates to an area of significant importance. The first major child care impetus followed the 1997 general election. The expert working group which was established by the then Minister in July of that year was the catalyst for progress in this area. I acknowledge the significant work which has been done in respect of child care in recent years by the Government and its predecessor, in conjunction with the social partners, whose direct input in this area I note.</P>
      <P>When one speaks about child care one normally considers the more populated parts of the country, such as the greater Dublin area, but I wish to be somewhat parochial. I do not agree with those who criticise the Government&rsquo;s child care policy. I compliment the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, his successor, Deputy McDowell, and the various Ministers of State with responsibility in this area. I represent a peripheral area which has many peninsulas etc. A group received &euro;269,000 in 2002 to establish a child care facility in the rural village of Ballydehob, which is in the heart of west Cork. Similar funds were allocated to the na&iacute;onra on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire and a facility in Coomhola near the Borlin Valley. It is wonderful that such isolated villages are benefiting from the Government&rsquo;s child care programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Paddy Sheehan got them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is why he lost. We are always saying that money is being spent in Dublin, but I wish to stress that funds are being allocated to places such as Bere Island and Castletownbere which are found on peninsulas which are far from places like Dublin. Contrary to what Deputy Curran said, a degree of certainty has been demonstrated in the programme for <Col N="1159"/>Government and the manner in which the equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006 has been set out over a period of seven years. The funding which has been allocated is hugely significant when one considers the level of funding available seven or eight years ago. I do not suggest that it is entirely adequate, however. An important point was made in the motion about tax allowances for people who are trying to avail of child care.</P>
      <P>It should not be forgotten that a substantial level of child benefits has been provided in the last six or seven years by this Government and its predecessor. As we approach next month&rsquo;s budget, it is important to note that 2005 will be the second last year of the equal opportunities child care programme and it would be wise to start planning beyond 2006. Deputy Curran was correct to state that while it is fine to point to what we have achieved, a great deal more remains to be done in this area. We are making a great deal of progress in respect of the provision of capital grants for the running of child care facilities. I am pleased, as a Deputy representing Cork South-West, that we are feeling the benefit in our area. It is by no means utopian. We have made great progress, and I would certainly welcome further advances in the area. We are now approaching the budget, a time when various Ministers are looking at the figures and what they will get next year, and I hope the impetus created will be maintained. This debate is topical and very appropriate, and it should be dealt with in a very balanced and fair way. We are gaining ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to make a contribution on the motion. I fully support the amendment tabled by the Minister and Government.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves regarding child care and its funding. A budget of &euro;449 million has been provided under the equal opportunities child care programme for 2000-06, and &euro;218 million of that has already been spent. My constituency, particularly my home county of Roscommon, has benefited from almost &euro;4 million of that, and some 34 projects have been funded under the scheme. That is an extraordinary development in child care for a population of 50,000 in County Roscommon. The projects cover all areas of the county, including Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Roscommon town, Frenchpark and Elphin down to some of our smallest villages. That has been achieved on the basis of moneys provided by Europe and the Government. Of course, there is another side to that coin. I am very pleased that the equal opportunities programme allows spouses, in particular women, to return to work. I could instance some of the housing estates, especially local authority ones, which have some fine community child care facilities that have brought a new breath of activity to stay-<Col N="1160"/>at-home wives. Child care and a homework club have been provided in certain areas. In particular, I mention the Lisnamult local authority estate in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>While that has been provided, obviously more remains to be done. My records show that there are five very important applications at present, which I support, namely, Four Mile House, Croghan and Boyle, Tulsk, Elphin for a staffing grant, and Lisacul. All those important proposals are being evaluated by ADM and the Department. They will have a further positive effect on the opportunity for child care in County Roscommon. One must remember that in the 1980s and 1990s we did not have such facilities. It was a black mark on this State at the time. All Governments were to blame that we did not have the foresight to see that close to 50% of the population represented a valuable asset to the workforce. Though in many cases they did great work, and still do, while looking after families at home, it was important that an equal opportunity to work be presented.</P>
      <P>This programme is very progressive and I urge that the good work be continued. I assure Deputies that, with the many projects in my county of Roscommon, we are very appreciative of the work done by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, the present Minister, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who visited the county several times. We greatly appreciated his involvement in the Frenchpark and Elphin community projects.</P>
      <P>I will turn to another issue raised, that of Government offices. The Department and the Office of Public Works have a responsibility to provide child care at all Government offices. I am pleased to say that at the Government office in Roscommon we are having child care facilities for 24. That is welcome, but it should be available everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be here too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be just in one office but in all Government offices.</P>
      <P>I also wish to comment on schools. We have been somewhat negligent in not evaluating the contribution that vacant schools can make to child care, particularly from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. I have no doubt that an arrangement between two Departments on this matter could provide facilities that we do not currently have. There may be issues to do with insurance or ownership, but ultimately it is all about providing facilities for our children. We all have a responsibility, regardless of whether we are State providers in schools or it is through the other system. We have a common responsibility. Ever more people talk about joined-up government, but it is very important that we see it in action. For me, the phrase means compatibility between the work of Departments. That should apply in the sectors where that facility is provided, including local government.</P><Col N="1161"/>
      <P>I compliment and congratulate this and the previous Government, since they are the first which thought it worthwhile to put any money into it or even bring forward a programme. They have provided about 50% of the funding, and I urge them to continue to ensure the funding is there for future staffing and that, if at all possible &mdash; I know it is not always so &mdash; they support community child care facilities first, which are necessary. In some of the private ones that have been provided and supported, the prices have been beyond some people on housing estates and on low incomes. I support the amendment and compliment the great work of this Government and the last, which initiated this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was quite evident in the general election campaign of 1997, when all of us canvassing were reminded of the great deficit regarding the provision of child care. Since that election and the investment that has taken place, particularly in the last few years, child care provision has certainly grown, and the number of places available is increasing in the community and private sectors. The success of that investment must be measured by the number of women in particular who are now free from the home at various times to re-enter the workforce and the numbers of those in marginalised communities who have taken the opportunity to return to education and improve their skills in one way or another so that they achieve full-time employment. It has now become a necessity to ensure good child care provision at community level and in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The costs have also risen since that time, and it is no harm to reflect on that now. The cost of child care has grown from approximately &euro;150 to &euro;200. It now represents nearly half the wage of someone availing of the facility. For that reason, we need more places in the market and more competition. To that end, we need continued investment. The schemes that currently exist are a work in progress. We must continue the investment that we started and increase its level because of its benefit to the workforce and communities. In my city the Father McGrath centre, for example, availed of a huge grant and is now providing extensive facilities there, adding to the facilities it already has as a family centre. The spin-off from that for families has been substantial.</P>
      <P>The three-pronged approach I see taking place with regard to capital provision for the private sector is paying off and we must develop it further. The social affordable element is paying off too and we need to create more spaces and increase the number of places not just in the urban centres, but to fulfil the demand for growth in centres around Kilkenny in Freshford, Thomastown, Kilkenny city centre and in Loughboy where there is a growing urban population. In order to achieve that, the child care committee at county level has prioritised its schemes and has made that submission which is being considered <Col N="1162"/>by the Minister. I would like to see a more immediate roll-out of funding to those schemes so they can begin providing child care within the communities at an early date. There are provisions other than those for child care which have a spin-off effect in the community. The delay between application and the awarding of funds is too great. That needs to be narrowed so we get a more active roll-out of places in a shorter time.</P>
      <P>I compliment the IDA which has opened a child care facility in its park in Kilkenny for those who work there. It is proving to be of great benefit to the work force and is attracting new people into the market because, be it a man or woman at home, this child care facility on the doorstep allows the work force to avail of the facility and encourages more people to come to work.</P>
      <P>Regarding decentralisation, I am glad that in a recent submission we got a clear indication from Mr. Phil Flynn that the provision of child care facilities around the decentralised offices is essential to part of the roll-out of that scheme. That indicates a so-called joined-up government or a joined-up spend as I would like to see it, and it is essential that we continue in that direction.</P>
      <P>We should in some respects follow in the footsteps of Gordon Brown in the British Government when certain tax initiatives were taken. Those involved in paying for child care or employing child minders in certain cases were allowed to make a claim on their personal taxes or credits. We should consider that approach. Because of the substantial costs of child care there is a need to offer those paying it some form of relief. It is good to get them back to the work force, and people also have the opportunity to expand their skills and education, but people must be rewarded in some way because of the amount of money they pay in child care. The most direct way to do that is through the taxation system. I know there is a preference for substantial increases in child benefit, which is a direct way of getting money to that sector, but we must consider those paying out and note that almost half of one person&rsquo;s wage now goes to pay for child care facilities. That cannot continue. We must give greater value for the money already spent, and on the back of that introduce some tax breaks for those who must pay out that sort of money.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on the roll-out of the funding and the schemes involved and I encourage them to introduce more of the same as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a timely and important motion on important issue. Other colleagues have outlined the Government plan so I will not go <Col N="1163"/>into that. I listened carefully to the speeches last night and in particular to that of Deputy Crowe from my constituency. I heard what he said about the projects in Tallaght, which I support. It is important for us to support them. Other colleagues talked of the number of projects in operation. Apart from the number of community projects in Tallaght, we are lucky that there are child care facilities provided by the local council in The Square, and others in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be flippant in a serious discussion but this discussion is about a lot done and more to do. In congratulating the Minister of State, I know he will not be offended by my saying that. Last week there was much discussion in this Chamber about the so-called Tallaght west report dealing with disadvantaged young people. I am glad some positive aspects emerged from that report. It highlighted the need for child care and for early intervention. The local Deputies in Dublin South-West received a document, An Unsuitable Fit, which is a submission on sustainability of community child care centres in disadvantaged urban areas. It was produced by Partas, of which I am a board member, and the Tallaght Partnership. I hope to have the opportunity later to put on record the points the submission made. It is important that we continue to support community projects in every sustainable way. There are demands for them not only in Dublin South-West and Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in. Other speakers have talked of the record of the Government in this area, the paths we are on and the reasons this issue has arisen over the past 20 or 30 years. I will avoid referring to the excellent work that the equal opportunities child care programme has carried out in the Dun Laoghaire constituency. In the time that remains to the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies I want them to say how they propose to pay for the extra resources they call for in their motion. It is a part of responsible government to make that clear to people. It would be regressive in the extreme to simply jump up and down and call for an increase in social spending without being able to show from where the matching increases in revenue would come.</P>
      <P>I notice from the previous Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto that the party wants Irish social spending to meet the EU average. That would mean a doubling of social spending, an increase of about &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion. We collect in income tax only about &euro;11 billion to &euro;12 billion so Sinn F&eacute;in might tell us tonight how they would raise the extra money. Clearly they cannot do so through borrowing because of the Stability and Growth Pact, unless they are talking of renegotiating that pact if they have the opportunity to go into Government.</P>
      <P>The plan may be to raise the money through income tax or corporation tax. One way or another Sinn F&eacute;in needs to explain to people that <Col N="1164"/>they are not merely posturing on a platform but have sensible, reasonable policies which they can justify in terms of future revenue. They say they want to increase funding to the level of what they describe as the Swedish model. Again that would mean an increase against GDP. As we all know at this stage, Irish GDP is much greater comparatively per head of population than in other countries because we have such a large level of foreign direct investment. Accordingly that is a very unfair comparison. I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will be able to address that when its Deputies get the opportunity to reply.</P>
      <P>In the past 30 years, because of the changes which have occurred in our social structure, there is much greater pressure in the child care area. For that reason in particular I am happy that this debate is taking place. It is one of the great challenges which regularly arises in the D&aacute;il and it is an issue we must tackle before we present ourselves again for election in a few years&rsquo; time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy McManus. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I commend the motion to the House. In spite of substantial economic growth in recent years, starting and raising a family has become a very difficult choice. Too many people with young children have a very poor quality of life. They try to juggle the competing demands of caring for their children and maintaining a job. Irish society is far from family-friendly and child care provision remains limited.</P>
      <P>The traditional pattern, where men were the breadwinners and women worked in the home, has changed radically and for the best. Women today want to use their talents and skills in the wider world as well as raising families. The number of parents raising families on their own has risen dramatically. These parents need child care to be able to work to support their families or to access training and education as a route towards well paid work.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believes that parents are generally best placed to judge what is the best care for their children. Public policy should support and respect those choices by ensuring a family-friendly society and work environment, securing an adequate supply of quality care of different kinds, and guaranteeing and supporting good standards.</P>
      <P>This motion refers to cr&egrave;che care. Such care has been made less accessible and less affordable for many parents on low incomes since the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, abolished the cr&egrave;che supplement a year ago. Prior to these changes, parents on low incomes could apply for the supplement to help send their children to a cr&egrave;che. However, since the supplement&rsquo;s abolition, it is reported that many cr&egrave;ches, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, are experiencing a drop in the number of children attending. The latter is placing many of them under financial pressure. <Col N="1165"/>Many of the children who were sent to cr&egrave;ches when their parents were able to obtain the supplement would have been identified by social workers as having specific needs. Due to the abolition of the supplement by the Government, however, hundreds of children are being denied this type of care and attention.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker applauded the Government for funding community based child care. I welcome this development. A great deal of work has been done in this area but many child care facilities are not receiving adequate funding from the Government. I wish to refer to a community-based child care facility with which I am working at present working, namely, T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g child care centre in Ballydesmond on the Cork-Kerry border. The centre recently obtained a staffing grant application but it is insufficient. I wish to read a short extract from a letter sent to me and other public representatives by the centre:</P>
      <P LI="1">On December 3rd 2003, we wrote to you asking that you use your influence to support our staffing grant application, and to ensure that the application would be granted in full, for years 2 and 3 of our Community Based Childcare Service.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Our staffing grant has been awarded, but there is a shortfall of &euro;100,000 that is &euro;1,000 per week. Can we ask you now to please advise us on any avenue that may be open to us to achieve any supplementary funding so that we can continue to provide the quality of service, the employment and the opportunity for the parents in our area to continue working.</P>
      <P FLI="0">One would have to ask if the Government is serious about child care provisions when situations such as that which obtain at T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g in Ballydesmond are arising all over the country. How does the Minister respond to this and similar situations? Perhaps when he is replying he will indicate the avenues T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g and other community child care centres can pursue in order to obtain funding to retain staff. How can we make such valuable child care facilities financially feasible if the Government does not provide sufficient resources for them? Does this Government expect cr&egrave;ches to resort to voluntary fundraising to make up the shortfall in their budgets. T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g recently held a race night to raise money to try to retain the services of a teacher.</P>
      <P>Prior to the most recent general election, the Progressive Democrats promised to fund an additional 40,000 child care places but the Government has not provided anywhere near that number. It has cut the cr&egrave;che supplement, slashed community employment schemes which help serve child care facilities and reduced funding for child care for those on VTOS training programmes. These represent more broken promises from the Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome a recent analysis from the ICTU on the cost of child care. It correctly points out that meeting the cost of child care continues to be the <Col N="1166"/>biggest problem facing working parents. Child care costs, at up to &euro;200 per week, are identified as second now only to mortgage payments in terms of parents&rsquo; budgeting. An ICTU study of child care in March 2002 found that working parents, particularly working mothers, have difficulties across a wide range of areas. One quarter of all women stated that they had not applied for promotional opportunities because of child-minding responsibilities.</P>
      <P>One of the largest barriers to accessing child care is the cost involved. Let us consider someone who earns under &euro;19,000 per year. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has estimated that nearly one third of that income is spent on child care, before rent, mortgage payments or any other bills are paid. A person who earns between &euro;19,000 and &euro;24,000 pays an estimated 21% of their income on child care. ICTU also discovered that 72% of women who work part-time cited child care costs as their reason for doing so. More than 33% of women in the workforce work part-time and are predominantly to be found in the low paid sectors of employment.</P>
      <P>Recent surveys of 400 parents were carried out in France, Italy, Denmark and Ireland. Of the vast majority of Irish parents surveyed, 90% of men and 86% of women had never taken parental leave. For many, the fact that parental leave is unpaid is the greatest disadvantage in respect of taking it. The study, which was co-ordinated by Trinity College Dublin, also found that 12% of women always use their annual leave when their child-minding arrangements fall through, a further 12% often use this option and an additional 30% sometimes do so. This means that 54% of parents in the workplace are obliged to use their holidays in order to mind their children.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is early childhood education. At the launch of the OECD report on early childhood education yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, stated that while significant strengths exist in these areas in Ireland, this country falls behind other countries in a number of key areas. She added that these issues are of enormous importance to Irish society. Does the Minister agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertion? The OECD report found that just 4% of three-year olds have received publicly funded pre-school education in Ireland. This compares with over 90% in other European countries. Does the Minister accept that Ireland has fallen far behind in this area in recent years, despite the existence of the Celtic tiger?</P>
      <P>I spoke during the debate on the maternity protection legislation on the issue of child care and parental leave. I stated that maternity leave is not afforded to Deputies and highlighted the fact that there is no cr&egrave;che in Leinster House. Politics is not a family-friendly business. It is shameful that 2004, despite proposals for a cr&egrave;che in Leinster House which have been circulating for many years, there is still no sign of one being provided. Women representatives with children need the <Col N="1167"/>full support of a partner who is willing to spend more time at home with the children. This is made even more difficult for those female Deputies who live outside Dublin. It is clear that much work needs to be done on this issue within the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas should be setting an example, leading the way as an employer and not dragging its heels. If the onus of responsibility for child care were placed on many of my male colleagues, and had it lain on the shoulders of their predecessors, we would have a first-class cr&egrave;che and respect for parental rights in Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate and the Labour Party supports the motion, as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in. It is a pity the Government refuses to do likewise.</P>
      <P>The care of our children should be a central issue for society. The quality of child care determines the health and well-being of an entire generation. It is scandalous that it has been sidelined and ignored for so long. A clearly funded child care policy based on the principle of the rights of children to care, security and opportunity and the right of parents to make arrangements of choice as to how best to provide such care for their children is needed.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, as other Members have stated, child care was work done by women in the home. Its value was never properly acknowledged and its benefits were taken for granted. The experience of women in Ireland has changed dramatically in recent years. The labour force increased by 570,000 between 1993 and 2003 and, of that number, 52% was accounted for by women. The trend is shifting downwards and surveys show that parents, mainly women, are leaving the workforce because of the cost of child care. While the rate of participation of women had been 50.7%, it had reduced to 49.4% by May 2004.</P>
      <P>A Government would be foolish to ignore what is happening. The contribution made by women in the labour force has been acknowledged as a major factor in the success of the tiger economy, yet despite this transformation care for children is still seen as primarily a woman&rsquo;s responsibility and the political responsibility for child care is fragmented and largely emasculated as a consequence. Who is responsible for funding child care overall and ensuring policy development? We have an amiable and hardworking Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, but with all due respects to him, he is a junior Minister dealing with a policy that extends across many Departments, which is too unwieldy to achieve coherence or provide an opportunity for a clearly funded and comprehensive child care infrastructure and policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Sean Power, is present and earlier the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government <Col N="1168"/>sat in on the debate. Both are excellent Ministers of State but their presence indicates where child care figures in the great scheme of things when it comes to the Government.</P>
      <P>The 2002 OECD review of early childhood education and care policy identified the deficiencies in policy and funding and made proposals to address them. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to a new group chaired by the Children&rsquo;s Office but this does not resolve the problem of who pays as the funding sources are still split and no plans are in place to reach the Barcelona targets. It is not clear how we get from here to there. By 2010 90% of children between three years and mandatory school age, and at least 33% of children under three years of age should be provided with child care.</P>
      <P>Quality child care is particularly beneficial to the thousands of children living in areas of severe disadvantage. Child care provides an opportunity for parents to take up work and it provides children with developmental opportunities and a practical boost to their life chances, which far outweighs State investment in child care centres in communities. The recent groundbreaking report on west Tallaght highlighted the disturbing fact that in a community that has 3,000 children of pre-school age, there was only 300 pre-school places.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency that is both rural and urban. Recently I visited a community play group in Tinahealy in south Wicklow. It has been providing an excellent service for years in a mixed community where children are treated equally and given a good opportunity in life. However, because the group does not fit the measure required by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is to release women into the workforce while ensuring their children are cared for, it has been refused funding. I urge the Minister of State to re-examine the value of such community play groups to ensure children do not lose out because a narrow view is taken on child care where it is provided.</P>
      <P>Last night, the Minister of State said that the quarterly household survey 2002 on child care showed that the majority of households were happy with their current arrangements, but that is not the case as it found that 45% of parents of pre-school children were not availing of their desired alternative to informal care because of financial considerations. A total of 33.6% said the option was not available to them. The option cited by parents were cr&egrave;ches or early educational facilities, preferably on a workplace basis. There was less dissatisfaction with school age child care, which is understandable, but this also raises the possibility that it masks a substantial level of self-care for the older child. That issue needs to be investigated further.</P>
      <P>The system of unregulated child care keeps the level of quality down as there is no notification or monitoring other than voluntary regulation for childminders and none for school age child care. <Col N="1169"/>This means we will never be able to introduce full Garda vetting of child care personnel, as proposed by the Minister a few weeks ago, or a tax credit system because we are dealing with the informal economy. Since childminding is mostly done by women, are we saying, as a society, that such women should not have the benefits of health cover or pension contributions?</P>
      <P>I refer to an issue of concern to service providers. The Government is committed in its amendment to taxation measures to promote supply. The case has been strongly made by the National Children&rsquo;s Nurseries Association and others that the current system of accelerated capital tax allowances is not working. It was expected to assist service provision by attracting investment into the sector. However, property developers are building child care centres with no regard to quality of the premises to simply comply with planning requirements. They get the benefits of the tax allowances while at the same time renting or leasing the premises to the child care providers at the going commercial rate. This has a knock-on effect on the cost of the local authority rates charged to the service providers. This spiral can add &euro;300 to the annual cost of each child care place. Rates relief, for example, would be a more practical and effective way to assist child care provision. I recall in a Finance Act a number of years ago rates relief was granted for the constituency offices of Members. It should be possible to make similar provision for child care providers.</P>
      <P>A number of essential issues need to be addressed in child care policy. The funding issue is significantly important both for parents and support providers. However, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has highlighted other issues, which include flexible working arrangements for parents as of right. Workers have rights to adjust their working times in the Netherlands while in Germany similar rights exist. I was rather struck that even in Greece flexitime is an entitlement. The ICTU case for a new statutory entitlement as well as better parental leave would make work-life balance a possibility for parents for the first time, instead of just an aspiration.</P>
      <P>The Government and the social partners must put child care higher on the list of priorities. If we are serious about encouraging women into the workforce and recognising them as more than cogs in a wheel to keep the economy moving forward while acknowledging the complexity of rearing children and contributing to the economy, wide-ranging measures, particularly those dealing with the workplace, must be introduced. Many thousands of people work directly or indirectly for the Government, which is a major employer in the State. They have little flexibility and freedom to make choices about what is best for their children compared with workers in other European countries. That is negative in terms of society as a whole. If our children are not looked after properly in a way that meets their needs, we <Col N="1170"/>are all losers, not just parents who are under stress and children who must deal with inappropriate arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Cowley and Cuffe. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion. It is an undeniable fact that many thousands of parents, especially women, would enter the workforce if a proper countrywide child care infrastructure was put in place. A crisis is looming in child care in the coming decade. The shortage of facilities for working mothers will need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Female entry to third level education outstrips male entry by more than 25%. Many of these women will be working parents within the next ten years. It is essential that quality affordable child care facilities be provided to enable our brightest and best graduates to remain in the workforce. The child care deficit is having an increasing impact on female participation in the labour market, a highly talented pool of more than 100,000 female workers. Ireland spends less than 1% of its entire education allocation to educate just 4% of pre-school children. This places us on a par with countries such as India and Zimbabwe. On the other hand, France, Germany, Norway and Denmark, wisely invest in excess of 10% of their budgets in the provision of quality pre-school education for over 90% of their three year olds.</P>
      <P>This motion equates pre-school education with pre-school child care. I submit that those children who have availed of this facility develop in the process improved linguistic, mathematical and literacy skills and have a distinct advantage throughout the rest of their school careers. Many parents in isolated rural areas and especially young mothers have joined parent and toddler groups and the vast majority indicate that they would use after school clubs for their children if such clubs existed. Parents have also expressed their interest in drop-in centres which would facilitate them to attend hospital appointments, interviews, training or leisure activities. Many families still continue to use the extended family as a child care resource, largely due to the dearth of such drop-in nurseries and cr&egrave;ches in many parts of rural Ireland. In such areas, there is an over-riding need for community based and community managed pre-school playgroups with a county childminding network as a major resource for parents. Such a network would face the challenge of co-ordinating strategy, increasing the supply and monitoring the quality of these facilities. In some parts of the country, mobile child care services have been developed and fill a vital need.</P>
      <P>A critical issue is the training of child care workers, many of whom were moving from the black economy to registered services. Some attempts have been made to address this problem with short-term training courses. Working parents have been short-changed on child care. In the area of vocational training, vocational train<Col N="1171"/>ing opportunities scheme child care support has been withdrawn from those parents who participated in VTOS courses to allow them continue or re-enter education. Many parents who applied for these courses were banking on the &euro;63.50 support towards child care expenses. The withdrawal of this support is a direct disincentive to those parents to pursue second chance educational courses. Many of these parents availed of these courses to return to the education system and to acquire vocational training. The courses were originally designed to make education available to people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Approximately 20% of the more than 5,000 taking part in the VTOS courses may already have been forced to drop out of the scheme in the absence of child care funding. The reduced level of funding to provide child care services for VTOS participants will have profound consequences for young mothers who may have previously dropped out of the education system and even perhaps for society in general.</P>
      <P>The lack of this funding will have the greatest impact in disadvantaged communities. Many of the emerging EU accession states would put Ireland to shame with their advanced child care provisions. The advantages of adequate child care policies for business and employers include minimal absenteeism, greater staff stability and productivity and a more contented workforce. A greater commitment to family-friendly labour market and child care policies on the part of the Government would reap significant benefits for business in general.</P>
      <P>The lack of child care provision, especially in rural areas, requires urgent attention. There is a preponderance of seasonal and small scale <i>ad hoc</i> services spread unevenly throughout the country. Employer interest and involvement is minimal. The standard of child care provision is particularly poor for children under one year old. The qualifications of child care workers vary throughout the country. Over 30% of workers have no formal qualification in the specialty. Salary levels are low with more than 70% earning between &euro;7,500 and &euro;15,000 per annum, not including community employment and job initiative payments. There is a high dependency on volunteer workers.</P>
      <P>A positive strategy for the development and management of an adequate child care infrastructure needs to be put in place in the interests of enhanced sustainable social and economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion. I congratulate the Sinn F&eacute;in Members for bringing it before the House. We are supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally but I wonder if we do. Wonderful work is being done throughout Ireland which does not get the support it needs. It is essential work and is an investment in the future. Education is very important, particularly at pre-<Col N="1172"/>school level and is very beneficial to children in the long run. It is an investment in our children and in the next generation. The economy needs a proper education system and learning should start at an early age. The State is very supportive of education at primary, secondary and tertiary level but I wonder about pre-school level where the deficit exists. The prosperity of the country can be attributed to the fact that women participate in the workforce and are prepared to work. If that situation is to continue, there must be investment in child care. There is evidence to show that women find it increasingly difficult to stay in the workforce because of the lack of support at pre-school level in particular. I support this motion and urge the Government to take the matter in hand.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the great work being done at community level. My community has a playschool. People have organised voluntary committees, great work is being done and great commitment is shown. I do not consider that the Government is supportive of the good work. There is a danger the playschool will not continue because of the lack of financial supports.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Some organisations are proactive and supportive in this regard. They have argued the case for better child care services. The National Children&rsquo;s Nurseries Association is an organisation for providers of quality full day care and after-school care. They provide quality care for approximately 30,000 children and I ask the Minister to consider their pre-budget submission. The basis of their case is that quality child care has a beneficial effect on children. We all know that poor quality child care militates against our children&rsquo;s futures. There is a need, therefore, to have people with the proper qualifications and they should be supported and given the employment they need. They should be remunerated adequately for their qualifications and the work they do. That is something that has not been recognised. There has been an emphasis on this area but it has not been on pre-school education in particular.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>People have a practical difficulty in trying to continue working while ensuring their children are properly cared for. The National Children&rsquo;s Nurseries Association has recommended that parental expenditure on child care incurred while accessing work, education or training should be a deductible tax credit and an allowable expense. The Minister should examine that. Also, paid maternity leave should be extended to one year to support parents. In respect of child care expenditure, tax credit relief should be provided to support parents in accessing work, training or education. Extending paid maternity leave to one year would support parents, particularly mothers, in their decision to return to work. These are rational measures which are important for the future.</P>
      <P>There is a need to ensure proper adult-child ratios and qualified staff, as is the case in national <Col N="1173"/>and secondary schools. There should be a minimum of staff turnover with suitable environments but all of that costs money. The NCNA is recommending a capital grant of &euro;2,500 per annum per child care place, and that income of up to &euro;6,000 should be exempt from tax. This should apply to child care staff and to income generated by owners of child care facilities.</P>
      <P>A good deal can be done which would be an investment in early childhood care and would provide the best opportunity for children to recognise and develop their full potential. In providing this investment the Government would make a major investment in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party welcomes and supports the Sinn F&eacute;in motion. We would go so far as to say it does not go far enough. It is timely to recognise child care issues and to consider the rights of children, who are under-represented in legislation and in the Constitution. I will do my part, through the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, to ensure that the needs of children are copper-fastened in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We are still in the dark ages regarding the rights of children and child care issues. It is remarkable that over the past ten years, when our economy improved dramatically, there was not a quantum increase in recognition of the rights and needs of children. At this time of the year, far too many parents are leaving their children in child care facilities in the hours of darkness and returning in darkness to collect them. We must examine in detail not just the quantity of child care provision but the quality of that provision.</P>
      <P>The child care regulations do not go far enough. They specify in great detail the staffing that is provided for particular ages of children but they do not specify the qualifications of those staff, nor do they specify the quality care that must be provided in such facilities. It would not take much to change that but what we do need is a change of thinking from the Government. Why is it that there is remarkable child care provision on the Continent? There are small kindergartens in beautifully manicured parks in the heart of every community, within walking distance of every home, yet we do not see that here. We see child care facilities surrounded by Tarmacadam, under-staffing and cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The cutback I am most incensed about is that in last year&rsquo;s budget in the cr&egrave;che supplement. That has directly affected one of the most vulnerable groups in society &mdash; working class mothers and their children in the heart of Dublin. When we talk about cherishing the children of the nation equally and providing more for those in pre-primary education, we must consider the impact those cutbacks have had on this community. We must reintroduce the cr&egrave;che supplement or revise it, if necessary. I would be the first to admit we should examine carefully the <Col N="1174"/>way such a system should operate nationwide but it was a savage cut that impacted on the least well off in society.</P>
      <P>We need to examine also those on higher incomes, and tax deductions would be a good way to examine how we can improve child care provision. At the lower income end, we have to consider greater direct support. We have to change the planning process so that the provision of child care places can be taken into account when granting planning permission for significant residential development.</P>
      <P>We also need to examine the role of parents, and particularly the role of fathers, in child care provision. Article 42.2.2 of our Constitution states that the State shall endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. The fact that that Article remains in our Constitution is symptomatic of the blind-spot in society regarding the needs of children and parents. We should gender-proof that Article and say that parents and guardians should not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. We must also have a quantum change in the provision for child care. That means examining the length of maternity leave and ensuring that fathers take paternity leave because children should have their fathers present at that early stage in their lives. We must examine the pragmatics of reinstating the cr&egrave;che supplement, continue the review of the child care facilities guidelines and ensure that the needs of children are placed much higher up on the scale of needs in society.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion. A huge amount of work remains to be done to ensure that children&rsquo;s rights are placed foremost and that child care concentrates on the quality as well as the quantity of provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.</P>
      <P>This Government came into office in 1997 when the provision of child care was at a very low base. We all know the history of the many positive developments to date. While the Government set very ambitious targets for the equal opportunities child care programme, the programme has already managed to exceed those targets and we are barely past the mid-stage. Over the life of the programme, the target was to increase the number of child care places by<?oasys _jy?>50%, or about 28,000 new places. Already, we have created 20,500 new places spread across every county in Ireland, and our commitments to date will, when fully drawn down, create more than 31,000 new places. The end result of this <Col N="1175"/>phase of the EOCP is likely to be nearly 35,000 new child care places.</P>
      <P>The programme, therefore, is already surpassing its original targets. We have achieved this, not just by ourselves, but by engaging with the voluntary child care sector and many community groups. Indeed, much of the EOCP&rsquo;s success can be attributed to the partnership approach that we have developed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government pays close attention to models of child care in other countries and the best practices internationally but it is inappropriate to suggest that any such model can, or indeed should, be imported lock, stock and barrel to Ireland. A number of countries that have comprehensive systems as part of their welfare state are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of those systems and are in the process of reviewing them. Rather than copy their systems as proposed, the approach adopted by the Government was to examine and take account of various options when devising solutions which best suit our circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is the approach that has seen the establishment of the EOCP. I thank the Deputies opposite who praised this programme in the debate last night as &ldquo;a fantastic success&rdquo;. It is not just they who have lauded this programme but, as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said last night, the OECD has also given it generous praise, particularly supporting its decentralised nature and partnership approach with the community sector. Both of these features are certainly aspects of which we can be proud.</P>
      <P>An Opposition Deputy last night pointed correctly to the importance of keeping the child at the centre of the child care debate. The Government has done this through the quality measures in the EOCP which aim to foster quality awareness. The services which we are developing are appointed to the highest standards and offer a warm environment for our youngest citizens.</P>
      <P>Of course, we cannot lose sight of the economic advantages of a good child care service. The Deputy spoke about parents having a choice between work and caring in the home but no such choice exists if there are no jobs to avail of in the first place. The massive increase in the number of women entering employment since 1997 has been driven not just by the increased availability of child care places but also by the greater levels of employment and higher wages which make work more attractive.</P>
      <P>This year, the Equality Act 2004 and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 have been enacted and put into effect. With the enactment and commencement of these two Acts the requirements of three EU directives and the complete set of commitments on maternity leave made by Government in conjunction with the social partners have been implemented. The <Col N="1176"/>Government is also amending the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to incorporate improvements made to the maternity protection legislation where relevant, in the Adoptive Leave Bill which is awaiting Committee Stage consideration in the House.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed as part of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement to strengthen the parental leave scheme in a new Bill which will be published during the current D&aacute;il session. This Bill will include the following: a statutory entitlement to take the 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks; raising the maximum age of the eligible child from five to eight years; an increase in the maximum age of the eligible child to 16 years in the case of children with disabilities; extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in respect of an eligible child. This legislation strengthens and improves the employment rights of working mothers and fathers. These improvements mark an important step by the Government to protect the rights of working parents in seeking to balance their family responsibilities with their work commitments.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have argued in this debate that the solution to child care affordability is to reduce the amount of tax paid by parents who use child care, a solution which would favour the better off to the detriment of those on low incomes. The Government is committed to both economic and social policies, including taxation, public expenditure and welfare supports such as child benefit, which allow all parents have such a choice, not just in theory but in practice.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for raising the child care issue. We all agree it is an important facet of modern life. The Government is delighted to have the opportunity to outline the positive achievements in the past seven years in building a vibrant child care sector in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; ar fad a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, ach go h&aacute;irithe leo si&uacute;d a l&eacute;irigh taca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n a chuir muid os comhair na D&aacute;la. Is trua &eacute; nach bhfuil an Rialtas s&aacute;sta an taca&iacute;ocht ch&eacute;anna a l&eacute;iri&uacute;. Is f&eacute;idir leis f&oacute;s an deis sin a thap&uacute; agus an leas&uacute; at&aacute; aige a tharraingt siar. Measaim nach gcuid&iacute;onn s&eacute; leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.</P>
      <P>Child care is the litmus test for any Government&rsquo;s commitment to equality and social and economic justice. While the lack of child care places is an issue for all parents, it disproportionately affects women, who are the majority of primary or sole carers of children in Ireland. It further disproportionately affects single mothers or those who are living in poverty. The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland has identified the lack of affordable, quality child care as the most significant barrier to women&rsquo;s equal participation <Col N="1177"/>in all aspects of society. That is the reason this issue requires urgent attention and immediate action to deliver child care places and funding for such places. There must be a change in the Government&rsquo;s priorities to deal with the urgency of the child care issue.</P>
      <P>Without access to child care primary carers cannot work on a full-time or part-time basis. They cannot access full-time education or training to prepare for better paid work. Instead, they are left in low paid jobs if they manage to work at all. Lack of child care is, therefore, a key factor in the feminisation of poverty &mdash; a quarter of the women in this State live in poverty. It is also the main reason for the ongoing gender pay gap and the concentration of women in low paid jobs.</P>
      <P>For the past four years the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland has demanded, as a socio-economic right, guaranteed quality child care places, which are accessible and affordable, for all children. Yesterday the council reiterated that call outside the gates of the House when launching its pre-budget submission. To date, the Government&rsquo;s response has been dismal. As long as access to child care is determined by whether parents can afford to pay for it, there will never be social and economic equality in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In recent months I met the local child care networks in my constituency. Both the Dublin 12 and the Dublin 10 networks expressed major frustration with the response of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the plans they submitted to address the need for child care facilities in those areas. Those plans have been stalled for a year because the Department is conducting an ongoing review. How long does it take the Minister to read the review? How long must the networks wait for that review to be published and acted on? Due to that delay, the original costings submitted are dated and, in some cases, entire projects are in danger of not proceeding. If nothing else happens in this debate, the Government should commit itself to releasing the funding so these vital child care projects can continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members who contributed to the debate. Some useful points were made. It was particularly useful that this most important matter was discussed. The awareness of the Members will have been raised in the course of the debate. This evening the Minister said: &ldquo;This Government came into office in 1997 when the provision of child care was at a very low base.&rdquo; I agree with that statement. However, it remains at a very low base.</P>
      <P>The Government could not care less about the issue of child care. The Government claims it is committed to promoting a work-life balance and claims it is making progress on child care. I challenge any member of the Government to make this claim to the parents of the 220 children currently on the waiting list of the Holy Family par<Col N="1178"/>ish cr&egrave;che in Dundalk, a situation mirrored throughout the State, to the women forced to give up employment to care for their children because their wages do not even cover the costs of child care and to the young mothers forced out of education and training because of the cuts in vocational training opportunities scheme child care grants. Many think such cuts may be coming to an end because Deputy McCreevy was banished to Europe but this is not the case. The right wing cell is still embedded in Government and is still driving Government policy.</P>
      <P>Having children in this State has become something that involves great financial and other difficulties for would-be parents. Couples who are already over-stretched, attempting to pay huge mortgages as a result of the price of housing, face extreme difficulties if they choose to have children. They cannot afford to lose one wage through one parent choosing to give up employment to look after the children, yet, child care costs, if they manage to secure a child care place, will eat up most of that wage, particularly if they choose to have more than one child. Any parent attempting to reconcile work and family life will tell of the amount of stress resulting from the child care crisis.</P>
      <P>I will specifically address the issue of leave entitlements for parents, which are crucial instruments for creating work-life balance and for creating a real alternative to out-of-home care for infants in particular, and for toddlers. Maternity, paternity and parental leave as well as benefit policies can help parents reconcile the competing claims of work and family life following the birth or adoption of a child and enable all parents who wish to do so to care for their children at least in the first year of their lives. The Government claims the provision of statutory entitlements through legislative measures is part of its approach to achieving the goal of making workplaces more family-friendly, yet this State ranked bottom of the list along with Greece and Luxembourg in terms of statutory maternity pay levels and maternity leave in an international global analysis of employment conditions and benefits in 60 countries which was published in 2003. May God help Greece and Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>As the motion states, it should be an immediate objective to enable parents who wish to do so to care for their children in the first year of their lives. This can be easily achieved through increasing maternity leave, introducing paid paternity leave and introducing payments in respect of parental leave. The motion reiterates Sinn Fein&rsquo;s call for maternity leave entitlements to be increased to 26 weeks paid and 26 weeks unpaid leave to enable mothers to care for their babies during the first year, as is the situation in the North, just 50 miles away. We are also seeking equivalent increases in adoptive leave entitlements.</P><Col N="1179"/>
      <P>For leave entitlements to play a real part in enabling parents to have the choice to care for their children in their first year of life, benefits covering close to full wage replacements must be paid. We call for an immediate increase of maternity leave benefits to 80% of wages. However, there also needs to be a commitment to raising this to 100% of wages by requiring employers to pull their weight in respect of maternity benefit. Currently, this only covers 70% of a woman&rsquo;s salary and the minimum payment of &euro;135.60 a week is disgracefully low &mdash; a Member gets more than this for one night&rsquo;s stay in the Dublin area. Its derisory level is a huge barrier to women in low paid employment who may wish to take up their full maternity leave entitlements.</P>
      <P>We also call for the introduction of paid paternity leave because while parental leave remains unpaid it will never reach its potential take-up. Currently, there is no legal entitlement to paternity leave, paid or unpaid, which is scandalous. Fathers North of the Border are entitled to two weeks paternity leave and we ask for the introduction of the same entitlements in this State, which is not an unreasonable request. Incidentally, I noticed the Government did not even mention paternity leave in its amendment, which I take as an indication of the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment in attempting to enable fathers to play an active part in rearing their children.</P>
      <P>Paternity leave, term leave, flexitime, special leave for domestic circumstances, unpaid leave to deal with domestic difficulties and career breaks are all available for workers in the Civil Service, and rightly so. However, we must ensure workers in the private sector also have access to such entitlements which can greatly increase their ability to balance work and family life.</P>
      <P>The exorbitant cost of child care has already been outlined by my party colleagues. It is important to note that the cost and lack of availability of child care is making the State increasingly uncompetitive. The Government's failure to ensure the provision of affordable, accessible child care and its failure to tackle house price increases naturally has the effect of driving up wage demands. The Government is pursuing a policy of wage restraints in exchange for tax cuts while the root causes of wage demands, such as the lack of affordable child care and other necessities such as housing, are being ignored.</P>
      <P>To those who would cry economic wolf, as was the case earlier in the debate, and in regard to equality and fair play for workers, I ask why those countries with advanced child care models, such as the Nordic countries, and which support real work-life balance are more competitive than or equal to this State despite having far higher levels <Col N="1180"/>of corporation tax. Part of the reason for this is that universal access to child care and generous leave entitlements are helping the competitiveness of their economies while the development of quality child care is self-financing through increased tax returns from women&rsquo;s work and lessened dependency on social security.</P>
      <P>This issue was raised on the Government side in the course of this debate. In direct reply to Deputy Andrews, Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions position that the tax system is still skewed greatly in favour of the filthy rich. Millionaires need not pay any tax. We would fund our proposal through a fair and equitable tax system. However, I fully understand why Deputy Andrews might not understand this as he is a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is clear that increasing funding for an expanded equal opportunities child care programme, as outlined in the motion, would be of economic benefit to the State. It is essential that child care services delivered through community employment schemes be mainstreamed. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, accepted in his contribution that community based services in areas of disadvantage will require ongoing contributions towards staffing costs. I would welcome an announcement from the Government stating clearly that community facilities, such as those referred to, will be guaranteed adequate, ongoing subsidies.</P>
      <P>We brought forward this motion because of the insignificant attention these issues have received in the Houses and because of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment to putting in place early childhood education and care policies that support the educational and social needs of young children and their families. Access to State-run universal pre-school for children aged three up to compulsory school entry age, a separate programme for under threes and the provision of parental, maternity and paternity leave which is comprehensive, generous and flexible and which facilitates work-life balance, are the core tenets of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s child care policy. Child care and work-life balance policies need to be driven by the criteria of what is in the public good and the recognition at all times that the rights of the child must be paramount. Early childhood education and care must be available to all children from the age of three years because it is beneficial to them regardless of their parents&rsquo; employment status or ability to pay. It also enhances their development and prepares them for entry to formal primary school, as well as providing care for those children whose parents are in employment or education. I commend the motion to the House. I hope we will enjoy the support of those Deputies on the Government side who spoke in favour it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate refers to the position of 230 people with intellectual disabilities who are accommodated in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, which was built in 1900. I am sick and tired of the neglect of St. Ita&rsquo;s and the ongoing broken promises of the Government to the needs of people who have minimal political influence. Over the past 25 years the health board, with the approval of the Department of Health and Children, has embarked on a programme to run down St. Ita&rsquo;s with a promise of alternative accommodation. As a result, there has been little or no maintenance and the residents and staff are living with the consequences on a dally basis. This is not good enough.</P>
        <P>The Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, adopted by the United Nations, states that people with a mental handicap have the same basic rights as any other citizens. The residents of St. Ita&rsquo;s have been short-changed. The Department of Health and Children is aware of the situation. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited the hospital as far back as 1996. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, has visited the hospital several times and while he is proactive in providing services, we await them still. Annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals are available to the Department which is well aware that many of the recommendations have not been implemented. There have been &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; specials on RTE, and Vincent Browne has continually highlighted these problems on his radio show. I compliment him on maintaining the pressure over the years. Anne Ryan brought a case to Europe and trade unions have consistently highlighted the inadequacies of the hospital.</P>
        <P>On 9 November 1998, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, announced with great fanfare a major development project for St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital which had already been approved by the Northern Area Health Board and which awaits finance. This project provided for 60 places at a bungalow-type facility to be built on the campus at St. Ita&rsquo;s. The day and other therapy services were to be relocated on campus and upgraded. Some of the existing units were also to be refurbished to provide appropriate accommodation for the remaining elderly residents. We await a significant response to this. I <Col N="1186"/>have a copy of a diary of assurances received by St. Joseph&rsquo;s Associates for the Mentally Handicapped in respect of the new campus complex which the management of various health boards made to them. More than six years later, a spade has yet to turn a sod. Will that ever happen?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, in a written reply on 8 July 2004 stated that his Department was considering the project in the context of determining capital priorities in line with overall funding resources. On the basis of this reply, I would not hold my breath. Hopefully, the Minister may be in a position to reassure me tonight. As far back as 1998 it was envisaged that the projects would be part-funded by revenue from the sale of hospital lands. The sale money must be used for this purpose and I ask the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley to ensure it is used in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, notwithstanding what his senior Minister, Deputy Harney, may have said on other aspects of the health board. I am deeply concerned by the contents of a section of a report, St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital site development and disposal strategy, for the Northern Area Health Board which came out last year. The report states realisation of the planning permission for the St. Joseph&rsquo;s residential development, about which we are speaking, may constrain the development opportunities of the site.</P>
        <P>I have grave concerns about the net effect of this statement. It is time for the Government to deliver on its promises to people with intellectual disabilities. Nothing less is acceptable. We have the opportunity to secure the finance and I ask the Minister of State to pursue that vigorously in Government and to be out there within the next six months or so to turn the sod on this complex.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue. My Department has since 1997 allocated significant levels of funding to the disability sector which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of the health related services provided to people with disabilities. Additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;388 million has been provided for intellectual disability and autism services since 1997. This has provided a broad range of new service developments and in particular has enabled the health boards to make significant progress in the provision of alternative accommodation and enhanced levels of support for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism resident in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate settings.</P>
        <P>Between 1999 and 2003 additional revenue funding of &euro;10.4 million and &euro;28.4 million capital was allocated to provide more appropriate care <Col N="1187"/>settings for persons with an intellectual disability, those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, those accommodated in de-designated units which were formerly designated as psychiatric services, and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The new accommodation includes community-based homes and a number of residential and day complexes. The data from the 2003 annual report of the national intellectual database indicate that there were 494 individuals resident in psychiatric hospitals. This is down from 571 in 2001 and from 970 in 1996. The report also indicates that of this group, 330 individuals with intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals have service requirements in the period 2004-08, with 307 of these having an appropriate alternative residential facility identified for them. The Northern Area Health Board has been working for many years to provide alternative appropriate care settings for people with intellectual disability in the St. Joseph&rsquo;s intellectual disability service.</P>
        <P>The provision of the residential and day services complex for 60 persons resident in the St. Joseph&rsquo;s services is one of the key capital priorities for my Department. This development is ready to go to tender. However, one issue which has to be resolved before it can proceed further is the sourcing of the additional revenue funding associated with this development. My Department is continuing to work with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to progress this project in the context of the multi-annual revenue and capital investment programme for disability specific support services recently announced as part of the national disability strategy. I am well aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in this matter and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed. I will do everything I can to bring the points raised to fruition.</P>

	<P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Carty.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment here tonight. Last Monday was a terrible day for the town of Westport. There were 240 permanent and 85 temporary job losses, totalling 325. In a town with a population of just over 5,000, this is a devastating blow. It is a tragedy for the workers who will lose their jobs. It is also a big blow to the local economy, not alone to the people affected directly, but also those who will be affected indirectly. There are many other company suppliers and hauliers who will be affected by this. I call on the Minister to come and meet the management and staff of that company. He must talk to the company so that it can give him reassurances and that he can give the staff reassurances that the existing 650 <Col N="1188"/>jobs are secure. Mayo County Council and IDA Ireland have bought some land and I call on the Minister to put the funding in place immediately to get that development park up and running.</P>
        <P>I compliment the staff of Allergan. Allergan has been a good employer in Westport and has been there for over 27 years. However, the town of Westport and the workforce have also been very good to Allergan. I saw a headline in the <i>Irish Independent </i>today which claimed that Allergan Ireland was heading for a &euro;25 million profit this year due to an increase in Botox sales. Therefore, the Irish people, the community of Westport and the workforce have all been good for Allergan. It is important that it stays and that the existing jobs are secure.</P>
        <P>Over the years, Allergan has put major investment into the town and it has got the return from the workforce. I compliment the manager, Colm O&rsquo;Neill, who is committed to Allergan, the staff and the town. I spoke to him on Monday and he did not like delivering this bad news because he has been there on days when a lot of good news has been delivered regarding jobs.</P>
        <P>Allergan is a big employer in my town and 350 job losses in a town like Westport is a massive blow. I ask the Minister to make Westport a priority with IDA Ireland. IDA Ireland should come and promote Westport and Mayo because over the past few years it has failed the town and the county. The Government has a policy on discrimination towards the west, particularly our region. It does not seem to have happened with jobs. As it is an area with Objective One status, I ask the Minister to make every effort to get replacement jobs for the town. The first step is to allocate the money needed for the development park. The Minister should also talk to the State agencies in Mayo. Many companies are coming under pressure from stealth taxes. A lot of pressure is being applied to small businesses. The Minister and his Department have a very important job to do. They have to look at what is happening in this country. Allergan is taking some of its manufacturing work out of Ireland and sending it abroad to China, India and Spain. In the past, we saw these companies coming into our country, but this is the first time we have seen a company like Allergan take workers out of the country. It is important that we protect what we have, such as the 650 jobs in Westport. It is important the Minister and his Department look at the cost factor involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for giving me time to speak on this issue and I welcome the Minister to this debate. It shows he realises the seriousness of the situation in Mayo, especially in Westport. What happened on Monday was a terrible blow. I offer my sympathy to the staff of Allergan who will be made redundant. It is terrible for them and especially for a company like Allergan, which has given such good employment to people in and around Westport and the county. It will have serious repercussions for several ser<Col N="1189"/>vice companies. I ask the Minister to come to Westport in the near future to appraise the situation for himself. I welcome the fact that a technology park will be developed there. I hope the Minister has some definite views on that. He should emphasise to IDA Ireland that industry should be located in Westport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister well on his appointment and thank him for coming into the House tonight. To have the senior Minister here for what is a serious blow to Westport and Mayo reflects the seriousness of the situation. This announcement of jobs is different from what we have experienced in Ireland. Many of the job losses we have experienced to date have been in the textile business, where it is cheaper to locate such businesses in the Far East due to labour costs. This is the first time such an announcement was made in the pharmaceutical business, which is the type of job we have tried to attract into Ireland because it is high-skilled. With the health care industry, it is an area in which we have been very competitive in the past few years.</P>
        <P>I am particularly disappointed for the town of Westport because of the social and economic implications that this decision will have in the town. To put it in context, Allergan is an employer of 1,000 people in a town with a population of 5,000. It is like losing 2,000 to 3,000 jobs in Dublin. It is a huge blow because this company has been a decent employer that paid well for 27 years. In many cases, there are husbands and wives both working in the plant. One can only imagine the implications that that will have for individual families. I welcome the fact that the Minister has stated that he will focus the attention of Government agencies on Westport in County Mayo. It is Government policy that 50% of all new jobs created in the country are located in the BMW region. The Minister should look at the performances of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in County Mayo for the years 2002 and 2003. We have had net job losses for both those years of 366 and 87 jobs, respectively. This is where we are supposed to be benefiting from positive discrimination.</P>
        <P>Jobs are being lost in Allergan now as a result of a decision taken in 2002. We have known since then of the company&rsquo;s difficulties, but we did not think that the issue would come to a head until April or May 2005. What have IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland been doing in the interim to ensure that the jobs can be replaced? The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme benefits County Mayo, thankfully, but why does it not benefit the town of Westport? Westport Town Council and Mayo County Council submitted a proposal for the decentralisation of jobs to Westport to the Government for its consideration.</P>
        <P>Allergan is reliant on the condition of our road infrastructure, especially the N5. Approximately 63% or 64% of the money allocated to the Border, midland and west region for roads has been spent, which is much less than that recom<Col N="1190"/>mended under the national development plan. County Mayo is starved of the infrastructure it needs. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have stated that they are having difficulties locating jobs in County Mayo because of its inadequate infrastructure and energy resources, which I hope will be alleviated by the supply from the Corrib gas field in the years and months ahead.</P>
        <P>I welcome Allergan&rsquo;s commitment to investing in its Westport facility in recent years. Its Westport plant is its largest centre of employment outside its home base in the United States. I do not doubt that the company is extremely committed to Westport.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies Ring and Carty that a visit from the Minister would be welcome. It would be useful if he could arrange a meeting with representatives of the company in the immediate future, even if it were not held in Westport. It is important that Allergan officials should know that the company is supported by the Government and State agencies. We need to do all we can to ensure that this devastating blow for Westport is minimised.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with the factory&rsquo;s employees who will be faced with voluntary redundancies. While it is a sad day for Allergan, I acknowledge that it has given 27 years of commitment to Westport. It will continue to have a presence in the town, as 630 Allergan jobs will remain there.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister focus on the role of the Government agencies? We need a serious commitment, rather than a hollow gesture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to discuss this important matter on the Adjournment. I wish the Minister well in his new job. The commitment of Allergan to Westport is clear, as it has invested in the town for 27 years. Like my colleagues, my heart goes out to Allergan&rsquo;s workers and their families, who are the subject of our immediate concern. The loss of so many Allergan jobs is a devastating blow to the area because people from many places in west Mayo other than Westport, such as Louisburgh, Mulranny and Achill, are employed at the plant. It is incumbent on Allergan to deal fairly and generously with its loyal employees who have been a central part of its success, as the company&rsquo;s officials will readily admit. I trust that Allergan will look after its workers because its managing director, Mr. Colm O&rsquo;Neill, is a very honourable man who has been a good employer in the area.</P>
        <P>New jobs are urgently needed to replace those which have been lost and the Minister should consider what he can do to that end. I hope he will act more quickly than his Government and previous Governments have done in similar circumstances in the past. There has been no sign of the investment that is needed in the west. That the section of the N5 between Castlebar and Westport will not be completed until 2018 is a typical example not only of the problems faced by the region but also of the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="1191"/>priorities. Although Allergan has been damaging its goods for years while transporting them along the N5, it has stuck with the western region, unlike the Government.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a root and branch review of the policies of IDA Ireland. There have been many job losses in all areas between Donegal and Cork. Why do such lay-offs always seem to take place in the west? It is a great difficulty.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why there has not been a commitment to bringing the gas which will enter this country at the Mayo coast to major towns such as Ballina, Castlebar, Westport and Claremorris which had gas 80 years ago, but not now. I wish the Government would address the infrastructural deficit in the west. The mid-term review of the national development plan found that there has been an under-spend of &euro;1.8 billion in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>We need to be competitive if we are to attract sustainable jobs. While it is wonderful that Allergan is based in Westport, we want the jobs which are being created in every other region. We do not want to be given the jobs which are not wanted anywhere else, but they seem to be coming our way. I am amazed that Westport, which made a strong application for inclusion in the decentralisation programme, was not even considered. That regrettable decision should be re-examined.</P>
        <P>I can cite many figures to defend my argument. If one examines this country&rsquo;s economic growth in recent years, one will see that while net industrial output increased by 14.6% per annum between 1991 and 1998, the equivalent figure for the western region was just 4.5%. It is an amazing difference. The west suffered 25% of national job losses in State-assisted companies between 2001 and 2002. The clear answer to these problems has been clearly outlined by the Western Development Commission. The Government needs to invest to address the western region&rsquo;s infrastructure deficit. It should support the regional enterprise strategy which fosters research and knowledge-based activities. It must assist the construction and expansion of the high-tech services sector and support traditional manufacturing sectors.</P>
        <P>I wonder about the many grants which are allocated to Dublin-based interests. Why does the Minister not make it more attractive for industry to come to the west? Many graduates from the west of Ireland live in Dublin because they cannot get employment in their local areas. Of the total, 62% must work in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow whereas just 9.8% of them stay in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. The Government seems to have forgotten that there is a need for balanced regional development. I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Martin, is new to this portfolio, but there are figures to prove that the proportion of net industrial output in the west is abysmal at just 7% com<Col N="1192"/>pared with 26.7% in each of the Dublin and south-east areas. It is time for this matter to be addressed. If one examines the gross value added, or GVA, of goods produced in the region, one will see that the average output per person in the west is -23.8%, which is significantly below the national average.</P>
        <P>The national development plan was supposed to lead to the delivery of investment and infrastructure through the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, but that has not happened. It has been a total and utter failure. Similarly, no serious attempts have been made to increase the availability of broadband in the region. We want action instead of words because there have been too many words over the years. Our graduates still have to leave; that is the difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Indecon mid-term review of the national development plan proves that the west is under-developed. We know exactly what is needed. We need the support which we have not been getting. We want to be competitive so that we can keep our people. The Minister knows what is needed, so I urge him to get on with it. He should not forget about the Allergan employees. He must come to Westport to meet them and assure those who have jobs that they will retain them. I ask him to ensure that Westport&rsquo;s industry will not depend totally on multinationals. All of our eggs should not be in the multinational basket. Will the Minister consider what he can do about traditional industry?</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Ring, Carty, Cooper-Flynn and Cowley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The announcement on Monday of the proposed job losses at Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Westport is a major blow to the company&rsquo;s workers and their families. I express my sympathy to the workers who will lose their jobs and to their families. I am conscious of the adverse effects, as outlined by the Deputies, of the lay-offs on the surrounding area. I understand that the job losses follow the company&rsquo;s loss of a manufacturing contract for contact lens solution products. The company stated that it is confident that it will be able to ensure the future success of the Westport facility, despite the job losses, with the introduction of further products to be manufactured in the plant. I welcome that commitment.</P>
        <P>Allergan has a strong record over the past 27 years, as the Deputies have articulated. It has demonstrated its commitment to its workforce and the Westport area. I want to work with the company and I will meet its local management to that end. I do not yet have a date for that meeting because a range of meetings are being lined up over the next six weeks. I want to meet the company&rsquo;s officials and to visit the local area in due course. The Deputies can rest assured of my commitment to work with the company as part of its future development.</P><Col N="1193"/>
        <P>I assure the House that every effort will be made by F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies to find alternative employment for those who have been made redundant. F&Aacute;S has contacted the company to inform it that its full range of support services is available to those who will lose their jobs. Those include top-level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually or in groups, with affected workers, which would outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by F&Aacute;S, based on identified workers&rsquo; needs and local opportunities. In addition, F&Aacute;S will refer workers to training courses or other options. The agency will establish special or customised training courses where necessary and will provide ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland continues actively to promote the Westport region to potential investors from a variety of sectors, including manufacturing and international services, through its network of overseas offices and project divisions, with every effort being made to secure new investment for the area. In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland continues to work with the existing base of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansion and diversification of activities. To continue to improve its attractiveness as a location for inward investment &mdash; a key point &mdash; IDA Ireland has acquired 37 acres from Mayo County Council in Westport and plans to develop the site into a business and technology park. Phase one of the site development will involve an IDA investment of approximately &euro;3 million, and a contractor has been appointed to go on site early this month. I see it as a key element of having an attractive package to offer a prospective investor or company, and it demonstrates the IDA&rsquo;s commitment to Westport that it has embarked on this initiative.</P>
        <P>The agency has also completed development of a new business and technology park on a 16-acre site in Castlebar and has secured advance planning permission for the construction of three 19,500 sq. ft. privately financed technology buildings in the park. At Ballina, the IDA is in negotiation with Mayo County Council for the purchase of 27 acres on the Sligo Road for the development of a business and technology park which will be a key addition to the infrastructure of north Mayo.</P>
        <P>I take the point made by the Deputies that we must bring all the agencies into play. Enterprise Ireland has already indicated the availability of its staff to visit the company for discussions regarding supporting entrepreneurship and potential start-ups and will work with IDA Ireland, the county enterprise board and F&Aacute;S in that regard. Enterprise Ireland will work with other agencies in the region to provide appropriate supports to assist those workers who have <Col N="1194"/>lost their jobs in finding alternative employment. The agency continues to work with its client companies in Westport and elsewhere in County Mayo to assist them to grow their sales and exports and improve innovation so that they can compete on world markets, and encourages companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland supports job creation through supporting entrepreneurs in setting up new high-potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support for research in companies and third level institutions. Since the beginning of 2003, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of more than &euro;2.5 million and made payments of more than &euro;1 million for projects for client companies in County Mayo.</P>
        <P>As part of encouraging high-potential start-up companies in the region, Enterprise Ireland has also supported a one-year incubation programme for entrepreneurs in third level colleges in the region. This business accelerator programme, known as the Enterprise platform programme, is designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business.</P>
        <P>To ensure its effectiveness, Enterprise Ireland is represented on a broad range of committees in the county, including Mayo County Enterprise Board, Mayo County Enterprise Board evaluation committee, Mayo County Development Board, Mayo County Development Board job creation and economic development working group, the western regional authority and the BMW operations committee. In working with those committees, Enterprise Ireland consistently promotes the development needs of indigenous industry. I echo Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s point that it is the other side of the equation, although the two are linked. Many indigenous companies develop as a consequence of foreign direct investment coming to a specific region, and there can be a good, strong interrelationship between them. We need not throw one out for the sake of the other; they are not mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>The agency has been working with the local authorities in the west region to urge them to become involved in the development and provision of broadband infrastructure. That has been successful, with Ballina and Kiltimagh being approved for metropolitan rings, along with Galway and Roscommon. Those are now in place, and a company has been appointed to manage them. Anything that the Government can do on that directly it has done.</P>
        <P>The existing 35 city and county enterprise boards provide a new source of support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. The function of the boards is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. The boards support individ<Col N="1195"/>uals, firms and community groups, provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. The boards exist alongside a number of other nationally and locally delivered supports for micro-enterprises, including Enterprise Ireland and local LEADER groups, which support small enterprise outside the main cities.</P>
        <P>Since the Mayo County Enterprise Board was established, it has assisted in the establishment of 495 new small businesses in the county through the provision of approximately &euro;3.5 million in grant-aid. Cumulatively, those enterprises have created 1,030 new full-time jobs and 242 part-time jobs in the county. The board has also provided business advice and training programmes to more than 2,000 persons involved in the operation of micro-enterprises in County Mayo, involving an expenditure by the board of more than &euro;1.3 million.</P>
        <P>Under the current National Development Plan 2000-2006, Mayo County Enterprise Board has delivered business training programmes specifically in the Westport area to more than 150 people and has approved &euro;187,000 to 26 projects in the region, with an associated potential of approximately 100 jobs. To respond to what Deputies Carty, Ring, Cooper-Flynn and Cowley raised about agencies working together, they are fully committed to ensuring an equal distribution of job creation opportunities and encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in part<Col N="1196"/>icular the Border, midlands and west region, which includes Westport.</P>
        <P>When one is attracting foreign direct investment into the country, the first task is to get firms interested in Ireland. There is great global competition from such countries as Singapore and Switzerland, and issues range from tax to skills. Once we have them attracted to Ireland, the next step is to interest people in the region. The development of infrastructural packages is important, particularly in the technology and industrial parks. The IDA has a clear strategy on that front. Enterprise Ireland is developing a forward strategy in line with the enterprise strategy group to strengthen indigenous performance, particularly regarding the internationalisation of skills and marketing, so that they can sell their goods abroad and secure a toehold in foreign markets, thereby strengthening the base of the company, as well as with research and development support, which is critical for indigenous enterprise.</P>
        <P>As I said to Deputies, Carty, Ring, Cooper-Flynn and Cowley, I am committed to visiting Mayo, subject to my tight diary, which is the only issue. In the interim, I can assure them that the State development agencies have all been contacted and will continue to work together and with local interests in promoting Westport and County Mayo for job creation and additional investment for the region.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the July 2004 OECD Thematic Review of Early Childhood Education and Care Policy in Ireland in which it is suggested that parental leave here be extended to one year after the birth of a child. The Government recognises the need to provide support to working parents after the birth or adoption of a child and has already made a number of significant improvements to our legislation to ensure this. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, which was commenced on 18 October last, makes provision for a working mother to take up to 16 weeks of her 18 week maternity leave entitlement after the birth. Added to this, she has the option of taking up to eight weeks&rsquo; additional unpaid maternity leave. Similarly, adopting mothers may take 14 weeks&rsquo; adoptive leave after placement and up to eight weeks&rsquo; additional unpaid adoptive leave. On 22 October last, I made an order, S.I. No. 667 of 2004, increasing the adoptive leave entitlement by a further two weeks to 16 weeks with effect from 19 November 2004. In addition to maternity and adoptive leave, the Parental Leave Act 1998 provides an entitlement for both parents to 14 weeks&rsquo; unpaid leave from work to take care of children up to the age of five years. The provisions of the maternity, adoptive and parental leave legislation combined offer working parents the option of taking up to 12 months&rsquo; leave from work following the birth or placement of a child.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed as part of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement to strengthen the parental leave scheme in accordance with the recommendations agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness Report of the Working Group on the Review and Improvement of the Parental Leave Act 1998. In this regard, on 8 September last, the Government approved the general scheme of a Bill for priority <Col N="1198"/>drafting. The main provisions of the Bill, which will be published during the current D&aacute;il session, will include the following: a statutory entitlement to take the 14 weeks&rsquo; parental leave in separate blocks; raising the maximum age of the eligible child from five to eight years; an increase in the maximum age of the eligible child to 16 years in the case of children with disabilities; and extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in respect of an eligible child.</P>
        <P>The Parental Leave Working Group considered a proposal to increase the duration of parental leave. However, no agreement was reached on this issue and the Government has no plans to make provision for an extension of parental leave.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down by law the maximum penalty appropriate to a particular offence and for the courts, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Legislature lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the courts to decide the punishment taking account of all the circumstances of the case and of the offender. I would be reluctant to depart from this approach save in those rare instances where it is considered necessary to make it abundantly clear to potential criminals that the commission of particularly serious or abhorrent offences will attract a severe penalty. Provision is made in the Criminal Justice Act 1999 for the imposition of a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years&rsquo; imprisonment in respect of an offence related to the possession of drugs for the purpose of sale or supply. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government for mandatory minimum sentences for a number of existing serious firearms offences and for new offences of creation and possession of a sawn off shotgun.</P>
        <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 enables me, as Minister, to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary <Col N="1199"/>and, in this regard, funds are made available to the Judicial Studies Institute which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
        <P>As regards consistency in sentencing, section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings. I should also mention that under the Criminal Justice Act 1993, the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.</P>
        <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in 1996 in a report which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Its report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in regard to some of the recommendations in the report, which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in regard to sentencing policy. The issue was also addressed in the recent report of the Working Group on the Jurisdiction of the Courts. The group, while it did not make final recommendations, drew attention to possible options to promote consistency of sentencing which are being considered in my Department. The courts are in the best position to see just what is the proper sentence. They alone can take all the circumstances in a particular case into account and seek to ensure that the scales of justice are being properly balanced.</P>

	<P>The announcement of a review of the incitement to hatred legislation was made by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a time when few, if any, successful prosecutions had been taken under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. One of the aims of the review was to ascertain whether problems with the Act were contributing to this lack of prosecutions and, if so, whether any reasonable changes to it could remedy that situation. Since the review was announced, a number of successful prosecutions have been taken under the 1989 Act and, where appropriate, under public order legislation or <Col N="1200"/>Coras Iompair &Eacute;ireann by-laws. These trends are being monitored as part of the ongoing review and if maintained could have a significant influence on the outcome of the review and any subsequent proposals for legislation.</P>
        <P>Two international instruments, the Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime dealing with criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks and a European Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, which has not yet been finalised, will also be considered to fully assess their implications in the context of the review.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>the reason provisions under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, providing for the traceability of alcohol sold on a takeaway basis have not yet been implemented; when such measures will be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27274/04]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provision for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified. The main reason for seeking to implement a labelling requirement by means of regulations is that this method permits notification of the European Commission in accordance with the EU technical standards (transparency) directives with a view to avoiding any later challenge to the legislation on the grounds that proper procedures had not been followed.</P>
        <P>As regards the making of regulations, I have recognised from the outset that while the labelling of containers with a view to combating under age consumption of intoxicating liquor is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome to render it effective in practice. These challenges arise under two headings. First, practical difficulties will be encountered where <Col N="1201"/>several individual containers are packaged together for sale, for example, a six-pack of bottles, a plastic-wrapped tray of cans, or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine. This raises the question of whether the label should be attached at the point of sale or earlier in the distribution chain. Attaching labels at an earlier stage is likely to increase distribution costs and create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors. In the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules. Also at the practical level, there is the possibility of labels being removed, or being made non-legible, after sale. The possible transfer of the contents to another unmarked container cannot be ruled out either.</P>
        <P>Second, from an enforcement perspective it is clear that possession by an under age person of a labelled intoxicating liquor container does not in itself constitute proof that the product had been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container. The container may have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith by the licensee before being passed on to the under age person. It may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of the underage person.</P>
        <P>Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and my Department subsequently raised them with the Office of the Attorney General. The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is, therefore, cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</P>
        <P>One possibility that could be considered in the context of future legislation would be a presumption that any intoxicating liquor container found in the possession of an under age person had been purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved. However, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time. I will, however, give further consideration to this matter in the context of the forthcoming Bill to codify the licensing laws.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the tragic events that occurred in Boston will be reviewed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of its less lethal programme. The two pepper spray devices authorised for use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are as follows: a special aerosol projector which is designed to deliver a directional pepper spray to a distance of 25 ft. to 30 ft.; and a ferret pepper spray shot which is a shotgun cartridge device that is intended to penetrate a door/window and deliver pepper spray inside.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise that the use of these less lethal devices is restricted to the emergency response unit where it is necessary to avoid the use of firearms. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not authorised to use CS spray. Guidelines on the use of authorised less lethal weapons are constantly under review to reflect the operational and technological developments in the area of less lethal alternatives.</P>
        <P>The use of CS spray in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI. However, I am informed that all instances of CS spray in Northern Ireland, including the incident in Derry to which the Deputy refers, are referred to the Police Ombudsman whose role is to investigate the circumstances in which it was used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a very general outline of proposals for the setting up of transit reception centres in north Africa which was canvassed by German Interior Minister Schily at the informal JHA Council on 30 September and 1 October 2004 in the Netherlands. As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 301 on 27 October 2004, the stated objective of the German proposals, which remain to be further elaborated, is to address the serious and ongoing problem of persons seeking to enter the EU illegally by crossing the Mediterranean by sea and the potential for serious loss of life which this involves.</P>
        <P>There is a recognition among member states, which is shared by the UNHCR and the European Commission, that action needs to be taken to tackle movements of people by sea in the Med<Col N="1203"/>iterranean region to avoid serious loss of life in the future. The Commission is considering funding proposals received from the UNHCR concerning the strengthening of asylum systems in certain north African states which involve, <i>inter alia</i>, promoting legislation and training of officials from the states involved in refugee status determination. This will enhance the capacity of those states to deal with refugee flows.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that the German ideas, which as I have indicated have not been elaborated on in great detail to date, raise a wide range of important issues which need to be addressed, including human rights, legal and humanitarian considerations and linkages to developing the capacity of regions of origin to deal with large-scale migration flows. Pending more detailed clarification from Germany, I am very much keeping an open mind on this issue and I have not yet brought Ireland&rsquo;s position on the matter to Government for a policy decision.</P>
        <P>For the information of the Deputy, the EU Council is at present considering a follow-up multi-annual work programme to the work programme agreed by the European Council at Tampere in 1999 covering, <i>inter alia</i>, the areas of asylum and immigration. This new programme to be called the Hague Programme was considered recently by the JHA Council at its meeting on 25-26 October 2004 and is due to be examined by the European Council on 5 November 2004. The new multi-annual programme will, <i>inter alia</i>, address in a comprehensive manner the external dimension of asylum and migration and will place far greater emphasis on partnership with countries and regions of origin and transit. It will also deal with the question of EU support for capacity building in those countries to enable them to better manage migration and to provide adequate protection for refugees.</P>

	<P>The commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in regard to Garda numbers states, &ldquo;We will complete the current expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and increase recruitment so that the numbers will increase by a further 2,000.&rdquo; When I took office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June 2002, the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stood at 11,748. After June 2002, and despite the cap on public service numbers announced in the 2002 budget, I proceeded with Government approval to increase the strength of the force to 12,200 by <Col N="1204"/>2004 and I am pleased to say that we are on course to achieve that target on time. When an additional 190 garda&iacute; are attested on 26 November, the force strength, already at a record high, will have reached or exceeded 12,200.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>A new recruitment campaign will start shortly as an initial step in increasing the force strength to 14,000. The Garda Commissioner will place advertisements in the national newspapers within the coming weeks inviting applications to join the force and record numbers of recruits will be taken on. Each quarter, for the next three years, around 274 recruits will be taken into the college, amounting to almost 1,100 recruits each year. Taking into account projected retirements, it will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as 2006.</P>
        <P>Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees are serving members of the force. Formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. Therefore, the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase three of their training but have not yet formally graduated. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 1,392 recruits have successfully completed phase three of their training and have been attested to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 6 June 2002 and that a total of 1,036 Garda members, all ranks, have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since that date.</P>

	<P>The position is that my Department has undertaken an ambitious joint project with the Law Reform Commission with a view to reforming and modernising our land and conveyancing law. Last week I launched a consultation paper entitled Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyancing Law which contains more than 90 draft recommendations designed to update and streamline this important area of law. Publication of the consultation paper completes <Col N="1205"/>the first stage of the project; it is being followed by the consultation stage which is now under way and will run until 31 December. The third stage will involve the drafting of a Bill, or Bills, to give legislative effect to recommendations for reform.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to bring forward proposals for draft legislation to give effect to the commission&rsquo;s final recommendations next year. These proposals will: simplify land and conveyancing law and improve its presentation to make it more easily understood and accessible for practitioners and the public alike; update this important area of law to accommodate changing social, demographic and economic needs, for example, new forms of property ownership; and make the conveyancing of property easier and faster with a view to reducing burdensome costs and delays.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will repeal about 150 pre-1922 statutes, the earliest of which date back to the 13th century, and replace them with a modern law of property that will meet the needs of the 21st century. The ultimate objective of this project is to facilitate the introduction of an electronic conveyancing system as soon as possible. Implementation of recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in regard to private property which are relevant to the scope of the joint project will be examined in the course of the project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Council of 25 March 2004 instructed that an EU regulation on security features in passports and travel documents should be adopted before the end of 2004 and this was completed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 25-26 October, with a period of 18 months being provided for practical implementation.</P>
        <P>On 8 June 2004, Council agreed that facial image should be the first mandatory biometric identifier and at the meeting on 26 October agreement was reached on the implementation of the first biometric within 18 months and agreement, in principle, on the implementation of a secondary mandatory biometric, fingerprint, within 36 months. The introduction of iris scans, as referred to by the Deputy, was not raised at this meeting of Council.</P>
        <P>Biometric features in passports and other travel documents will be used for verifying the authenticity of the document and the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features when the passport or other travel document is required to be produced by law. It is an important contribution to ensuring that pass<Col N="1206"/>ports and other travel documents are protected against fraudulent use.</P>
        <P>As this regulation builds on an aspect of Schengen co-operation in which Ireland does not participate, Ireland is not bound by it. However, the Government believes that the incorporation of biometrics in passports, in accordance with the standards proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, can make an effective contribution to increasing security of international travel. The Government, therefore, welcomes this development, even though Ireland is not bound by the regulation.</P>
        <P>It is important to note also that the United States enacted legislation after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 that requires all visa waiver countries, including Ireland, to introduce passports containing biometric information by 26 October 2004, subsequently postponed to 26 October 2005, as a condition of remaining in the visa waiver programme. The Government agreed, in principle, to the introduction of passports containing biometric information subject to a further Government decision at a later stage on the practical arrangements for its implementation. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is currently examining these issues and it is expected that a proposal will be submitted to Government in the near future.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the CSO survey on crime which showed that the number of persons who were victims of personal crime more than doubled between 1998 and 2003; the way in which he reconciles these figures with official Garda figures showing a lower level of crime; the steps he intends to take to address the significant decline in the level of public confidence in the Garda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The findings referred to by the Deputy were published following the Central Statistics Office Quarterly National Household Surveys carried out in the fourth quarters of 1998 <Col N="1207"/>and 2003. These surveys include crime and victimisation modules related to crime experienced in the previous 12 months.</P>
        <P>It is the case in all countries that police statistics do not, and cannot, record all the crimes recorded in any one year. In Ireland, as in other jurisdictions data compiled for police forces are compiled mainly for operational purposes and have to be seen in that light in interpreting the general level of crime in society.</P>
        <P>One source of valuable information to complement police statistics is a crime survey, such as the CSO crime and victimisation modules. These are designed to measure the extent to which a representative sample of the population has been victimised. The aim is to build up a picture of how much crime there is in the community, including those crimes that may not be recorded in the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s annual report. It is generally accepted that Garda statistics do not record all the crimes committed in any one year, not least because it is not possible that the garda&iacute; would be made aware of them all. The quarterly household report from the CSO reports that, in some instances, victims do not report crimes because there has been no financial loss or because they believe the crime not to be serious enough to warrant reporting it to the authorities.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that a regular national crime victimisation survey, carried out biennially, would be a valuable complement to the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s report and would provide a more comprehensive perspective on crime victimisation. When undertaken on a regular basis it would provide useful information on emerging trends in crime. The report of the Expert Group on Crime Statistics, which I recently published, recommended the establishment of a central crime statistics unit, <i>inter alia</i>, to: examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the Garda; examine the collation of information relating to other crimes where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not the prosecuting authority; identify the needs of the key stakeholders within the criminal justice system and the wider research community; and to make recommendations on the necessary structures and resources to be provided to allow statistics compiled within the criminal justice system to be analysed so that emerging trends can be identified. I have accepted the recommendation to establish this unit and work is under way on establishing it in the Central Statistics Office. This <Col N="1208"/>unit will design and carry out the National Crime Victimisation Survey.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the CSO survey indicates an increase in the number of persons who were victims of personal crime. However, figures available from the Garda Commissioner in his annual report for 2003, and which was published late last week, indicate that during 2003 a decrease of 3% was recorded in headline crime and a decrease of 14% was recorded in non-headline crime. This represents a total of 51,132 fewer crimes for 2003 when compared with 2002. This downward trend in crime levels was continued through the first nine months of this year. The report from the CSO notes that the vast majority of persons, over 93% in fact, felt safe alone in their homes after dark.</P>
        <P>A recent survey commissioned by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and carried out by an independent company with considerable experience in the area of criminal justice research, indicated that 85% of respondents were either very satisfied or satisfied with the overall Garda service. We are fortunate to have a force comprising of men and women who continue to be dedicated to providing an efficient and effective policing service to the citizens of the State. In this respect the ongoing, targeted, crime prevention operations of the Garda, such as Operation Encounter which tackles the issue of public order, and Operation Delivery which seeks to address attacks on cash delivery services, help reduce crime and its effects. Garda management will, I am sure, remain vigilant to changes in criminality and will take action to counter specific trends and threats as issues become evident.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that as of 1 November 2004 there were 86 juvenile liaison officers, JLOS, garda&iacute; and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country. In addition to this, the <Col N="1210"/>National Juvenile Office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 2001 came into law in May 2002 and it was at this point that the Garda diversion programme began operating on a statutory basis. This Act introduced the concept of restorative justice and family conferencing into the criminal justice system and these provisions are currently being put into effect by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda diversion programme is delivered throughout the country by specially trained garda&iacute;. Resource implications are constantly under review and applications for additional resources are made on a case by case basis when and where necessary.</P>
        <P>In regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased to say that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Prog<Col N="1211"/>ramme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties and the area of juvenile justice. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has recently approved my proposal to achieve a force strength of 14,000 for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with commitment contained in An Agreed Programme for Government. As part of the preparation for this recruitment campaign, I have taken the opportunity to ask the Garda Commissioner to review the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is an opportune moment to ensure that the criteria for entry meet the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the society it serves.</P>
        <P>One particular aspect which the Commissioner has already studied is the maximum age of entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This arises from the need to implement Directive 2000/78/EC, which, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of age. In this regard, I can inform this House that I intend bringing to Government for approval the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal to increase the maximum age of entry from 26 years of age to 35 years of age. This is a significant change which will extend the opportunity to many more people of a career in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and increase the pool of talent available to the force. It is my intention, after the necessary consultations with the Garda Representative Associations and subject to Government approval, that the new maximum age will apply to the next Garda recruitment competition to be advertised in the coming weeks.</P><Col N="1212"/>
        <P>In addition to the age of entry, there may be other criteria which would benefit from review. It is right, for example, that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society, and I am anxious to see if there are any possible changes to the existing criteria which might facilitate recruitment from the different ethnic backgrounds in our community.</P>
        <P>One of the eligibility criteria which could benefit from review is the entry requirement for Garda recruits to have passed Irish in the leaving certificate or an equivalent examination. This has implications for potential recruits from different ethnic backgrounds. However, it would be wrong to assume that the answer is simply to do away with the need for Irish. Clearly, whatever new arrangements might be put in place, Irish will continue to have an important place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. In this regard, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force and that will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a largely unarmed police force, polices our community by consent, a proud tradition greatly facilitated by the force&rsquo;s close links with the community it serves. I want that tradition to continue and prosper, and it seems to me necessary, therefore, to examine ways in which the relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ethnic minorities in our community might be fostered. The recruitment into the force of members from these different ethnic backgrounds would clearly be a positive step in this regard, for the recruits, the force and the public generally.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the review of the eligibility criteria by the Commissioner, I will consider carefully whether to bring to Government any proposals for further changes to the entry requirements.</P>
        <P>As regards the retirement ages for sergeants and inspectors, the position is that I currently have no plans to increase the retirement age for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were recruited to the force prior to 1 April 2004. The changes in the retirement age for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, outlined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, will apply only to new entrants who are recruited to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na after 1 April 2004.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent calls from Amnesty International for the EU&rsquo;s Justice and Home Affairs policies to provide better protection of human rights; his views on whether the EU&rsquo;s Justice and Home Affairs agenda is dispro<Col N="1213"/>portionately concentrated on security and illegal immigration issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the views of Amnesty International as set out in its document, More Justice and Freedom to Balance Security: Amnesty International&rsquo;s Recommendations to the EU. The development of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is assured is a core objective set down in the treaties but one which the treaties also recognise must be accompanied by appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the combating of crime. The treaties also provide that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the member states. The treaties further require the Union to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the member states as general principles of Community law.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the task of developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice has been approached with due regard to these requirements and that there has not been a disproportionate emphasis on security and illegal immigration issues. I am also satisfied that the Council&rsquo;s approach to those issues directly concerned with security and illegal immigration is balanced and underpinned by a concern for the protection of human rights.</P>
        <P>Amnesty&rsquo;s recent submission is directed in part to the next phase of that process. The European Council decided in June that the time had come to launch the next phase of the process of creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice and invited the Council and the Commission to prepare a programme for the coming years. The Netherlands Presidency has taken forward work on that programme and the outcome will be considered by the European Council later this week. The views of Amnesty International and others have been taken into account as part of that process.</P>

        <Quest>the reason Ireland is not participating in the Council directive laying down minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in member states whose Article 13 proposes that EU member states be required to put in place rules that do not exclude the access of applicants for asylum and their accompanying family members from the labour market six months after they have lodged their application.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 405 and 293 on 5 October and 27 October 2004, respectively. The position remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>The EU legal instrument referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. This directive is covered by Title IV of the EU Treaties and by the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland under which the State has an option to participate in its provisions. Many of the key provisions of the directive, although the responsibility of a number of Departments and agencies, are already covered by national procedures and, in many areas, our national standards exceed those provided for in the directive. The modalities and implications of the exercise of this option in respect of this particular directive are under consideration at present.</P>
        <P>By way of clarification, I point out that Article 11 rather than Article 13 of the directive addresses the issue of access to employment. That article provides, <i>inter alia, </i>that member states shall determine a period of time, starting from the date on which an application for asylum was lodged, during which an applicant shall not have access to the labour market. If a first instance decision has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, member states shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant. The article further provides that for reasons of labour market policies, member states may give priority to EU citizens and nationals of states parties to the agreement on the European Economic Area and also to legally resident third country nationals.</P>

	<P>The Children Act 2001 provides a comprehensive statutory basis for responding to the needs of offending children, through a diversionary and restorative justice approach, and to the needs of non-offending children, who may be in need of special care or protection. In addition to its child welfare provisions, the Act establishes a sound legal framework for a modern juvenile justice system based on the underlying principle that there should be a suitable intervention for every child who commits an offence.</P>
        <P>It is by its nature complex legislation and several Departments and their respective agencies are involved in its implementation. The National Children&rsquo;s Office co-ordinates this process. Considerable progress has been made to date in implementing the Act&rsquo;s provisions and detailed <Col N="1216"/>work is ongoing across the board to achieve the phased implementation of the remaining provisions.</P>
        <P>There is, however, room for some fresh thinking about the institutional framework by which services in the youth justice area are delivered. I have recently set up a project team in my Department to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the delivery of the State&rsquo;s services, in accordance with the Children Act 2001, in the area of youth justice, focusing on the institutional framework with a view to improving outcomes in the area.</P>
        <P>The team is headed by an assistant secretary and comprises five people in total at present. Further personnel will be attached to the team as and when required. The team will consult the relevant governmental and non-governmental actors in the area and will also evaluate relevant international developments. The Deputy will be interested to note that as part of the consultation process an advertisement calling for submissions appeared in the national newspapers earlier this week. I expect the team to report to me before summer next year.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that the Government&rsquo;s approach continues to be the philosophy underlying the Children Act 2001, namely, that prevention through early intervention is desirable, that detention should be a last resort and diversion and community sanctions should be available and used wherever appropriate, and that when detention is required it should be in an institutional environment that is educational rather than penal.</P>

	<P>Approximately 400 letters have been received in my Department from solicitors representing former and serving inmates in this State alleging that their clients&rsquo; human rights have been violated due to the practice of slopping out.

        <P>A new accommodation block for Portlaoise Prison is currently the subject of a tender competition and it is anticipated that construction works will commence in 2005 and be completed by 2007. As the costs and operational issues of retro-fitting in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison is prohibitive, the Irish Prison Service is <Col N="1217"/>looking to develop new state-of-the-art prison facilities on greenfield sites. In the case of Mountjoy Prison, a process is under way to identify suitable sites near Dublin. In regard to Cork Prison, my officials and the Office of Public Works are examining plans for a new prison development on Spike Island.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, is intended to increase the availability and quality of child care across the country. The programme is funded by the Exchequer and the European Union Structural Funds as part of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan. Initially, &euro;317 million of Exchequer and EU Structural Funds was made available to the programme over the life of the national development plan. The Government increased this to over &euro;436 million through an additional package of Exchequer funding and through interdepartmental transfers. In recognition of the many achievements of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 up to December 2003, the funding for the programme was recently increased to &euro;449.3 million following transfers of EU and Exchequer funding. These transfers were based on recommendations made in the mid-term evaluations of the national development plan and its constituent operational programmes.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Estimate and outturn in respect of child care for each year up to October of 2004 is detailed in the table below:</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is important to remember that the EOCP is an EU supported programme and that an underspend in the early stages does not impact on the overall funding package which will be spent by 2007 in accordance with EU regulations. The Estimates&rsquo; provisions for the initial years of the programme did not fully anticipate the delays associated with the creation of major new projects and it has subsequently been found that <Col N="1218"/>there is a lead-in time of approximately two years for large-scale capital projects. This is in line with infrastructure projects in other sectors and contributed to the underspend in the early years. As the programme has progressed, the annual Estimate has more closely matched the expected pattern of demand and the Deputy will be aware that the child care sector now has the capacity to grow rapidly and is so doing.</P>
        <P>The total funding committed under the equal opportunities child care programme up to the end of September 2004 is over &euro;264 million. Over 2,600 grants have been awarded to child care providers and community groups, which will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of approximately 29,700 new child care places and support almost 28,000 existing places. Since the inception of the programme every locality has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the demand for grant support under the EOCP to date has been very high. It is expected that the full amount of the funding available will be expended over the life of the national development plan and that full use will be made of the &euro;177 million of EU funding which is available to the programme. I am currently in discussion with the Minister for Finance and my Cabinet colleagues about the ongoing resource needs for the child care sector.</P>

	<P>Allegations of serious wrongdoing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as those broadcast on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; prog<Col N="1219"/>ramme, are of serious concern to me. Some of the cases featured in the television programme of 8 January were previously reported and in the public domain. A number of the cases have been dealt with in the courts or by the existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms. One case is due to come before the courts and there may yet be other civil actions so the House will appreciate that, in the circumstances, I am limited in what I can say on the specific details of individual cases.</P>
        <P>I can say I have just received &mdash; in fact, on 1 November 2004 &mdash; a report from the Commissioner in respect of all matters featured in the broadcast in question. In the report, the Commissioner reviews the investigation of each case highlighted in the programme, and proposes a number of specific measures with regard to the systems, practices and procedures which operate within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the existence of adequate safeguard mechanisms for the mutual benefit of members of the public and the force. The Deputy will appreciate that I will need to carefully study the report and discuss it with the Commissioner before making any further detailed comments.</P>
        <P>The House knows my view that the existing law and procedures for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not adequate to the task. Allegations of the type aired on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; provoke entirely legitimate unease in the public mind, but can also cause frustration within the force at what is sometimes seen as a lack of balance and fairness. The most fundamental objective now must be to put in place a mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which commands the full confidence of members of the public and the force alike and which will adjudicate on complaints in a manner accepted by all as authoritative. To this end, a key objective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which is currently before Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is the establishment of a fully independent ombudsman commission which will have wide powers to investigate complaints made against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I hope that these proposals will come before this House soon and that they will have the support of all Deputies.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including person<Col N="1220"/>nel, that there are currently 373 Garda personnel employed in administrative posts. I am further informed that the information requested by the Deputy in regard to the ages of the personnel referred to is not readily available and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought.</P>
        <P>In 2001, the Government approved the civilianisation of administrative posts throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a phased basis over a number of years. These included administrative posts in headquarters, branches and in the various offices located in divisions and districts. In addition, the civilianisation programme also provided for the transfer of finance functions from Garda district clerks to civilians and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer. The filling of these particular posts is now nearing completion.</P>
        <P>The position as regards the civilianisation of Garda posts is that it must be rolled out within the confines of the Government decision of 4 December 2002. This decision places a cap on numbers across the public service. My Department is currently reviewing the position with both the Department of Finance and Garda management as to how we will proceed further in the context of the overall constraints of public service numbers.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, I am pleased to say that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>I understand that a capital grant application for over &euro;3.2 million was submitted by the group to my Department some time ago. <Col N="1221"/>This is one of the highest grant amounts ever sought for a single project under the programme.</P>
        <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and following the mid-term review additional funding of approximately &euro;12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;449.3 million.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private childcare sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of &euro;114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme&rsquo;s objectives and this has brought to &euro;157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently exceeds &euro;30 million, of which about &euro;25 million is being earmarked for community based not for profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Ltd., on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding <Col N="1222"/>from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.</P>
        <P>I have made inquiries and I understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process to which I have referred. I understand that the recommendations in relation to the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight timeframe. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it may be considered again should additional capital resources become available and if the project has adequately demonstrated that it would merit funding under the programme during the review process. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the group in question has previously been approved a total of &euro;362,927 in staffing supports under the programme. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the problems identified in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the interim speed camera system have been addressed. As the report notes, spoiled images <Col N="1223"/>result mainly from two causes, difficulties with number plates and technical problems with cameras and films. The chemical developing solution has been resolved by the Garda Technical Bureau, as has the issue of dirty lenses and their obstruction. It is inevitable that a camera in a fixed position by a roadway, subject to splashing or being otherwise obscured as a result of weather conditions will continue to require particular maintenance. Issues relating to member states are addressed by enforcement of the law relating to them. Enforcement difficulties involving foreign registered vehicles and drivers with foreign licences are being addressed through the EU and British Irish Council. Legislative changes in road traffic legislation will be made as considered necessary. Improvements have also been made to the Garda interim computer system currently in operation. I am confident that the action being taken will reduce the default rate significantly, in particular, through the rollout of the fixed charge processing system which is now at pilot stage.</P>

	<P>I received and published the report of the Expert Group on Crime Statistics in July this year. The terms of reference of the group were, <i>inter alia</i>, to: examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the garda&iacute;; examine the collation of information relating to other crimes where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not the prosecuting authority; identify the needs of the key stakeholders within the criminal justice system and the wider research community; and to make recommendations on the necessary structures and resources to be provided to allow statistics compiled within the criminal justice system to be analysed so that emerging trends can be identified.</P>
        <P>The expert group was comprised of members from my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service, the Prison Service, the Central Statistics Office, the National Crime Council and the research community and was chaired by Mr. David Kennedy. In its report, the group made recommendations in two broad areas, relating to improvements in the current system and more fundamental changes. I have accepted the recommendations of the group. In regard to the recommendation that a new central crime statistics unit be established to compile and publish enhanced crime statistics, based initially on data derived from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system, the unit will be located in the Central Statistics <Col N="1225"/>Office. My Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Statistics Office are currently engaged in working on the establishment of this unit.</P>

	<P>The review of the procedures of the witness security programme, which operates under the direct control and administration of the Garda Commissioner, is ongoing. The review includes: consideration of a relevant judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal; the measures to support witnesses in court cases who may not wish to enter the programme; and current best practice from an international perspective. I can assure the Deputy that, when received, the recommendations of the review will be given full and careful consideration.</P>
        <P>In respect of the particular case raised by the Deputy, it is not the practice, and it would be contrary to the public interest, to comment on individual cases. However, it should be noted that admittance to and continued participation on the witness security programme is entirely voluntary on the part of the witness, and no compellability can be or is involved.</P>

        <P>These questions refer to a specific case where the High Court granted leave to the applicants to seek judicial review in respect of certain deportation related matters. The High Court has not yet heard the substantive arguments in the case nor has it made a judgment. An appeal to the Supreme Court does not, therefore, arise.</P>
        <P>An undertaking not to deport was provided to the court in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. The approach to be taken in any judicial review proceedings depends on the circumstances of the case in consultation with the State&rsquo;s legal advisers.

	<P>Among the official amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which I will be introducing during the Committee Stage debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will be an amendment to provide for the establishment of an independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate.

        <P>The relevant legislative provisions are currently being drafted. However I can say the new body will comprise three people, one of whom will be known as the chief inspector.

In that context, it will look at thematic policy issues with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experiences. The new body will also provide advice and support to the Minister so that he or she will have independent objective information in relation to the work, operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>I have not yet received a final report of the group established to examine potential sites for a prison complex to replace that at Mountjoy. I do, however, understand that the group has identified three or four particular sites as being potentially the most suitable for consideration as a site for a new complex and these are being explored further. I expect that the exercise will be completed before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>While no final decision has been made to demolish the women&rsquo;s prison facility at Mountjoy, it is true that additional facilities are required for women prisoners and one option being considered is to construct an improved facility on a new site. In such a case, it may prove more cost effective to transfer all the prisoners from the existing site at Mountjoy to the new location when construction work has been completed, making the D&oacute;chas facility redundant and freeing up space for a more attractive redevelopment of the Mountjoy site.</P>
        <P>Work on the construction of the D&oacute;chas facility and a 300 space multi-storey car park started in early 1997. About three quarters of the total cost of the project were associated with the D&oacute;chas facility, which would give a construction cost of approximately &euro;13 million for the women&rsquo;s facility. For the reasons explained, the D&oacute;chas facility will, at a very minimum, continue to remain in operation until a new facility has been completed and brought into operation, which will not happen before 2007-08 at the earliest.</P>

	<P>It is the practice of the Irish Prison Service, in common with most prison systems worldwide, not to issue needles or injecting equipment to prisoners. There are good health, safety and security reasons for not providing needle exchange programmes in prisons and to do so would be inconsistent with the commitments set out in the Government programme. Emphasis within prisons is on health education and, where appropriate, substitution treatment. Prisoner health education not only discourages injecting behaviour but also points out the health benefits of not sharing needles and injecting equipment.</P>
        <P>The report of the group to Review the Structure and Organisation of Prison Healthcare Services considered the matter of developing a syringe exchange programme within Irish prisons and came to the conclusion that such a step could not be recommended.</P>
        <P>Furthermore the programme for Government states:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">we will publish a plan to completely end all heroin use in Irish prisons. This will include the availability of treatment and rehabilitation for all who need them and the introduction of compulsory drug testing for prisoners where necessary.</P><Col N="1229"/>
        <P FLI="0">My Department in conjunction with the Irish Prison Service, has been working hard to implement the Government&rsquo;s response, as stated in the programme for Government, to deal with this serious issue. Early in the new year we will implement our new strategy of mandatory drug-testing, addiction counselling and treatment, increased measures to prevent drug usage, and a genuine system of rehabilitation.</P>

        <P>During 2003 the Commissioner approved the establishment of a Garda National Safety Com<Col N="1230"/>mittee. The committee establishes on a formal basis, a consultation process for staff associations representing employees in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on matters pertaining to health and safety.

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all ranks, as at 15 October 2004 was 12,117.</P>
        <P>Existing and additional resources provided to the Commissioner will be used to optimum effect and in a focused way. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the question of resource allocation. Among the areas being examined by the Garda Commissioner is the number of garda&iacute; deployed in traffic units. The Commissioner is committed to increasing significantly the number of traffic units around the country as resources become available.</P>
        <P>In addition, the commissioner is considering structural changes in this area of Garda activity with the aim of increasing the effective use of personnel and equipment resources available. I will be announcing changes in this area in the near future.</P>
        <P>The increase in the number of garda&iacute; will enable extra garda&iacute; to be allocated to the traffic units which enforce road traffic legislation and contribute to reducing road fatalities and casualties throughout the State. In particular, it will make possible an increase in targeting enforcement on high risk locations and times and days of the week, in line with Garda operational policy.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 which was recently launched by the Minister for Transport forms the framework within which road safety policy will be developed over the next number of years. Many of the targets and actions recommended in the strategy are already at various stages of implementation or planning, including the private operation of speed cameras and the outsourcing of the collection of fixed charges. The Road Traffic Bill 2004, which the Minister for Transport has published and which is currently before the D&aacute;il, will facilitate the removal of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from routine administrative duties and the redeployment of these resources for the purpose of front-line policing and enforcement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 223 together.</P>
        <P>There is no provision in the Juries Act 1976 for the payment of expenses to jurors or their employers from State funds. When the Act was introduced, consideration was given to this matter but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as the performance of jury service is considered to be a basic civic duty which arises relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned. The Deputy will, however, be aware that section 29 of the 1976 Act does make provision for employees to be paid by their employers while on jury service.</P>
        <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed over the level of the fine for non-attendance for jury duty. I share this view that the fine for non-attendance is inadequate and it is my intention to consider this issue and other matters relating to juries at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>Mindful of the commitments in the programme for Government, a group comprising Irish Prison Service management, prison governors, health authority representatives and clinicians have been consulted in relation to a drugs policy for the Irish Prison Service. The intention is that the drugs policy will facilitate consistent regulation and operational structure in pursuing supply and demand reduction.</P>
        <P>The policy will have regard to the commitment in the programme for Government to end all heroin use in Irish prisons and my commitment to achieving a drug-free prison system. Working to fulfil these commitments will involve implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population and meet prisoners&rsquo; treatment needs.</P>
        <P>Central to supporting future supply and demand reduction will be the introduction of mandatory drug testing as envisaged in the programme for Government. Already prisoners accommodated in the open centres at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, the designated drug free areas of the training unit in the Mountjoy complex, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and Wheatfield Prison are required to undergo frequent drug tests to confirm their drug-free status. Mandatory drug testing will, however, operate across the <Col N="1233"/>prison system. It will enable identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enable enhanced focusing of resources and act as a deterrent to drug misuse. The new prison rules which are currently being finalised by my Department will include specific provision for mandatory drug testing. Early in the new year we will implement our new strategy of mandatory drug-testing, addiction counselling and treatment, increased measures to prevent drug usage, and a genuine system of rehabilitation.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Immigrant Council of Ireland&rsquo;s comments relate primarily to migrant workers in Ireland. In this regard, Irish policy on family reunification is broadly in compliance with international standards and operates in the following manner. There is no general policy of restriction in operation in relation to family reunion where the family members in question are not visa required. The only caveat is that the worker in question must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds. The spouses and children of the vast majority of foreign workers in the State fall into this category. There are restrictions on family reunion for visa required family members since in general terms persons from visa required countries pose the greater immigration related risks.</P>
        <P>In the case of visa required family members of non-EEA national workers, the general rule is that it is only after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered employment for a further 12 months that the worker may be joined by his or her family. Again, this is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds.</P>
        <P>In 2000, the aforementioned 12 month waiting period was reduced to three months by my predecessor in the case of the family members of workers operating in certain specified high skill areas covered by the working visa programme.</P>
        <P>The considerations underpinning this policy in the case of visa required family members is to ensure that the worker&rsquo;s presence in Ireland has a degree of stability and is likely to be for the longer term. Our practice avoids a family joining a worker whose employment relationship is not yet up and running and where that relationship may prove to be short term.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 225 together.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to reduce opening hours or close any Garda station. It is the case that the use of Garda stations was considered as part of the major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation which looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The Garda SMI implementation steering group&rsquo;s final report, which I have laid before the House and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, does not refer to the closure of any specific Garda station, but rather makes recommendations to assist policy making in relation to the management and use of all available resources, including Garda stations.</P>
        <P>It is also the case, however, that the position has changed significantly since the consideration of these issues under the strategic management initiative, in that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which proposes the most fundamental modernisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State, provides that the Commissioner will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform. It would be premature to anticipate at this stage what proposals, if any, might be developed by the Commissioner in this context.</P>

	<P>My proposals for the introduction of a fixed charge procedure in relation to certain public order offences are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which I published in July this year and is awaiting Second Stage in the D&aacute;il at present. Section 29 of that Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to certain public order offences under that Act. The procedure will apply to an offence under section 4, intoxication in public place, and section 5, disorderly conduct in public place. It is intended that the fixed penalty procedure will be an alternative to criminal proceedings being taken in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In general, the section provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person who is not less than 18 years old is committing, or has committed, an offence under sections 4 or 5 of the 1994 Act may serve on the person personally or by post a fixed charge notice. In default of payment the person will be prosecuted for the offence.</P>
        <P>The fixed charge notice will be in a prescribed form and will state specified factors including, when and where the fixed charge offence was alleged to have been committed; that a prosecution for it will not be instituted if within 28 days the person pays the prescribed amount, or within a further 28 days an amount which is 50% greater than the prescribed amount; and how the payment may be made. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will also be empowered by section 29 to make regulations prescribing relevant matters which will include the amounts to be set for the fixed charges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>At its meeting on Tuesday, 5 October 2004 the Government exercised its power under section 10(4) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925 to dismiss a superintendent from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It did so in the light of the findings of the Morris tribunal, and having <Col N="1236"/>taken fully into account the representations and submissions made by person dismissed.</P>
        <P>At the time of dismissal, the person concerned had accrued a pension entitlement based on just over 27 years&rsquo; pensionable service in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is not a full pension, which requires 30 years pensionable service. The accrued pension would not be payable until 2012 when the person will have reached 60 years of age. I understand that the dismissed person has applied for an immediate, but actuarially reduced, pension under the recently announced retirement scheme which will become operational when detailed guidelines have been prepared by the Department of Finance. The application from the person concerned has been transmitted to the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Pensions Order 1925, and agreements made within the Garda Conciliation Council, deductions can be made from pensions only in cases involving financial loss to the Exchequer. This is meant to cover cases involving fraud and the like.</P>
        <P>I would also like to mention that the Morris tribunal stated at paragraph 13.20 of its report that:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . the Tribunal notes that early dismissal can lead to the loss of pension. In the majority of instances, this is an unnecessary and unfair consequence. A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may work for years, legitimately building up credits on his or her pension fund, and then require to be dismissed by reason of a single, or a series, of evil actions. It is conceivable that a person who has been commended, even for bravery, might fall to the degree that requires their dismissal. It does not seem logical that the consequence of a short period of bad service should result in the removal of the benefits legitimately gained, perhaps through years of hard work and application.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the circumstances, there are no proposals to seek to deny the person concerned his accrued pension.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not yet possible to provide a total estimated cost of the Garda policing <Col N="1237"/>arrangements relating to the US presidential visit in June 2004, as a small number of claims and suppliers&rsquo; invoices remain outstanding.</P>
        <P>However, I am also informed that, as at 29 October 2004, the cost of the Garda policing arrangements relating to the visit of the US President was &euro;7.549 million. I am further informed that approximately 3,800 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were deployed in relation to the visit, during the course of which seven arrests were made. Estimates of Garda man hours are not yet available.</P>
        <P>The level of security provided was deemed necessary given the profile of the VIPs who attended the June summit and the worldwide terrorist threat, and the Garda authorities consider that the consequent disruption and inconvenience was minimal.</P>
        <P>Moreover, it is worth pointing out that the visit by President Bush was important both nationally and in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s very successful Presidency of the European Union. Accordingly, any costs involved should be considered to be part of the normal expenditure required for Ireland to maintain its national and international obligations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> both the United States and the European Union.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent figures produced by the Health Research Board showing that drug use outside of Dublin almost trebled between 1998 and 2002; the steps that are being taken to prevent the supply and distribution of illegal drugs in these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s overall policy to tackle the drug problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008: Building on Experience, and responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy lies with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
        <P>The report compiled by the Health Research Board to which the Deputy refers, trends in treated problem opiate use in the seven health board areas outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority, 1998 to 2002, was launched in early September 2004. I understand the report shows that the numbers in treatment for heroin use outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority has increased in that four-year period rather than determines the extent of any increase in drug prevalence in these areas during this period, as is suggested by the Deputy. In terms of such prevalence, I am informed that the best estimates available at present on opiate use were released by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs last year. Its research found that there were approxi<Col N="1238"/>mately 2,200 heroin users outside Dublin, although a number of these would be in Wicklow and Kildare which are part of the ERHA region.</P>
        <P>While the fact that a significant number of opiate users continues to exist among our communities remains an issue of major concern which leaves us with no room for complacency on this matter, the increasing numbers of such users who are coming forward and presenting for treatment, as it becomes more readily available and which is highlighted by the findings of the Health Research Board&rsquo;s report, is in line with one of the key commitments in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, which is to increase the number of treatment places available for drug misusers.</P>
        <P>Regarding the specific trends in opiate misuse in the seven health board areas, in particular, in counties Carlow, Cavan, Louth, Meath and Westmeath, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has already recently informed the House that he will be continuing to monitor this situation closely. The programme for Government calls for monitoring the use of heroin, in particular outside of Dublin, and in this regard, the NACD is currently in the process of setting up an early warning system to address this issue.</P>
        <P>In addition, the regional drugs task forces, which were set up to develop appropriate policies to deal with drug misuse in the regions, are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as the range and level of existing services with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. Where opiate use is a problem in particular areas, it is expected that this will be reflected in their action plans coming forward in 2005.</P>
        <P>In relation to drug supply reduction, I am informed by the Garda authorities that due to the nature of illegal drug distribution within the State, the Garda tackles the problem on a number of different levels. At local level, divisional and district drug units have been established with the remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities and responsibility for the co-ordination of drugs policy has been assigned to an individual in each Garda district. Furthermore, as a follow up to requests from local communities, the Criminal Assets Bureau focuses on local drug dealers who profit from criminal activity. At a national level, units such as the National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and the material benefits which accrue therefrom.</P>
        <P>In addition, other units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the national criminal intelligence unit all indirectly support drug law enforcement. All the national support units are now under the dedicated direction of an assistant commissioner.</P>
        <P>Internationally, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has liaison officers based in London, Paris, The Hague and <Col N="1239"/>Madrid as well as at Europol and Interpol headquarters to facilitate international co-operation, especially in the area of drug-related crime.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to the objectives of the National Drugs Strategy and the force will continue to rigorously enforce the law in relation to the supply and distribution of illegal drugs in all areas of the State.</P>

	<P>The tribunal of inquiry into complaints concerning some garda&iacute; of the Donegal division, chaired by Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, was established by my predecessor in April 2002. Since I have come into office, my Department has worked to assist the tribunal in every way possible. The tribunal has already demonstrated its effectiveness in its first report, and the Government has shown its determination to take action on its findings.</P>
        <P>As regards dealing with complaints of Garda wrongdoing more generally, whether in Donegal or elsewhere, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 provides for the establishment of an independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission, in place of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complaints board. The ombudsman commission will ensure there is openness and transparency in dealing with complaints. Its primary function will be to investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in that respect it will have comprehensive powers of investigation and ultimate control and oversight of all complaints processed in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. It will also have the power to investigate of its own motion any case involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where death or serious harm to a person has occurred, where it is desirable in the public interest, or where any matter appears to it to indicate that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence, or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.</P>
        <P>In addition, among the official amendments to the Bill, which I intend to introduce during the Committee Stage debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will be an amendment to provide for the establishment of an independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate. This proposal is being brought forward in the light of the recently published report of the Morris tribunal and the questions arising from it relating to the need for measures to improve <Col N="1240"/>democratic accountability for the actions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>While the relevant legislative provisions are being drafted, I can say that the new body will comprise three people, one of whom will be known as the chief inspector. The key objectives of the inspectorate will be to ensure and promote efficiency and effectiveness in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In that context, it will look at thematic policy issues relating to standards, practice and performance benchmarked against comparable international policing experiences. The new body will also provide advice and support to the Minister so that he or she will have independent objective information with regard to the work, operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to quantify, at any particular time, the number of criminal gangs believed to have invested in properties or the number of properties in the hands of criminal gangs.</P>
        <P>However, I am satisfied that the criminal law in this jurisdiction does not make it easy for criminals to launder money or invest the proceeds of crime in the legitimate property market. On the contrary, a broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable serious and organised crime to be confronted effectively. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to Questions Nos. 8 and 294 to 299, inclusive, tabled for answer on 8 July last.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to exercise its statutory remit to target assets, including property, derived from organised crime. The powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau will be further bolstered with additional measures in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, now before the Seanad. The Bill will make certain technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and, in particular, will remove any doubt there may be over when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for the purposes of that Act.</P>
        <P>Implementation of EU money laundering directives has severely limited the scope of criminal gangs to launder proceeds of crime and a third such directive is being negotiated. Following its agreement, my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine what, if any, national legislation is required to give it effect. Ireland&rsquo;s law and pro<Col N="1241"/>cedures on money laundering were the subject of a favourable review in 1998 by the financial action task force under that body&rsquo;s procedure for the mutual evaluation of its members. The next mutual evaluation of Ireland is due in 2005.</P>

	<P>Road traffic legislation, including road safety legislation, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for the enforcement of that legislation.</P>
        <P>The Garda national traffic bureau, headed by a chief superintendent and based at Garda headquarters, was established in 1998 to give greater focus and direction to Garda road safety initiatives. There are now traffic units in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement and a new unit, managed by the chief superintendent in Dublin Castle, is currently operating on a pilot basis in the Dublin metropolitan region. All Garda personnel have, <i>inter alia</i>, a responsibility to deal with road traffic matters as they arise.</P>
        <P>I recently announced Government approval for an extra 2,000 garda&iacute; and I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the question of resource allocation. Among the issues being examined by the Garda Commissioner is the number of garda&iacute; deployed in traffic units. In addition, the Commissioner is considering structural changes in the area of Garda activity with the aim of increasing the effective use of personnel and equipment resources available. I will be announcing changes in this area in the near future.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that collision-prone locations are identified on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of the National Roads Authority and local authorities. This data serves as input into the enforcement activities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Garda&iacute; have a high visibility on motorways because high ramp areas for their use have been engineered. In fact, figures show that only 2% of speeding detections are in those areas. I am informed by the Garda authorities that 1% of fatal accidents occur on motorways.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board or authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. The last such increase was notified in January 2004 and the next increase is due by the end of this year. Entitlement to health services is primarily based on residency and means.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and-or their dependants without undue hardship. The chief executive officers of the boards or authority are reviewing numerous issues with regard to the administration of the medical card scheme and I understand that their findings and recommendations will be available in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out in the health strategy. This will focus on people on low incomes. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.</P>
        <P>For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of those conditions free of charges. Under the drug pay<Col N="1245"/>ments scheme, a person and his or her dependants will not have to pay more than &euro;78 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
        <P>Health board chief executive officers have discretion with regard to the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite a person having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes an entire series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF. These include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency, providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards, and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available. In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the entire legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</P>

	<P>In April 2003, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al published the report of a review of neurology and neurophysiology services. The report recommended significant enhancement of such services, including increases in consultant staffing. It also recognised that there are aspects of a number of other specialities and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework for the development of neurology services.</P>
        <P>Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications, will offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and with the Irish Consultant Neurologists&rsquo; Association on the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the report of the national task force on medical staffing.</P>

	<P>The aim of the home help service is to enable people to remain living at home who would otherwise need to be cared for in long-stay residential care. This service is an essential support to families and informal carers. The home help service by its nature is a flexible service which is designed to respond to clients&rsquo; needs. The service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients in accordance with their assessed need. As a result, therefore, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time and in these circumstances it would be difficult to set targets for service delivery. To ensure effective prioritisation of the service, assessments are undertaken at local sector level and are carried out by the public health nursing services.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons why demand for the home help service has been increasing. Approximately 6,000 additional people come into the over 65 years bracket every year and there has been a proportionately higher percentage increase in the more dependant over 80 category. These factors may necessitate some minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service to individual clients. Basically, this means that although a small percentage of clients may have had their hours reduced in the recent past, this has been counterbalanced by others receiving the service for the first time. I have been assured by all health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that priority is given to the most vulnerable clients.</P>
        <P>The following table illustrates the number of home help hours delivered by the health boards for 2002, 2003 and 2004.</P><Col N="1249"/>

        <P>I understand that Bray Urban District Council commissioned a report in 1986 to examine the effects of flooding on the Dargle river in Bray. I am advised that the council has implemented the first phase of the two phases recommended in the report. In view of the severe flooding that occurred in the south and east last week, all available resources are committed to advancing flood relief projects currently in the OPW work programme. There are no proposals at present regarding the River Dargle in Bray.</P>

        <Quest>the amount of income tax paid by a double income family with a gross pay of &euro;56,000 and a single income family with a total gross pay of &euro;56,000, assuming two equal incomes of &euro;28,000 and salaries of &euro;37,000 and &euro;19,000 respectively; and the way in which this compares to the amount of income tax paid by a single income family with gross pay of &euro;56,000, assuming a home caring spouse is claimable and a home caring spouse is not applicable.</Quest>

	<P>The position is that the tax rates and bands for a married couple for 2004 are as follows: married couple, one spouse with income &mdash; first &euro;37,000 @ 20% and balance @ 42%; married couple, both spouses with income &mdash; first &euro;37,000 with increase of &euro;19,000 maximum @ 20% and balance @ 42%. In the case of married couples with two incomes the standard rate band available to one spouse will not be greater than that available to a one income married couple, that is, &euro;37,000. The second spouse may avail of the balance of the &euro;56,000 band.</P>
        <P>A home carer tax credit of &euro;770 can be claimed by married persons who are jointly assessed to tax and where one spouse works at home to care for a dependent person, which includes a dependent child, provided certain conditions are satisfied. A married couple cannot claim both the home carer tax credit and the increased standard rate band. They can, however, claim whichever of the two is the most beneficial. The home carer tax credit is not due where the home caring spouse&rsquo;s income equals or exceeds &euro;6,620.</P>
        <P>The following eight examples show the income tax payable by single and double income families as requested by the Deputy on a gross income of &euro;56,000 for the current tax year. The examples refer to earners in the PAYE and self-employed sectors and are based on the assumption in each case that the married couple is jointly assessed for tax purposes.</P><Col N="1252"/>

The figures given previously for 2000-01, 2001 and 2002 were found after further examination to have been inflated by the inclusion of claims which were subsequently found not to have been validly based or were validly based initially and ceased to be so at a later stage. The current revised figures are based on adjustments made for these factors. The numbers above have been estimated to the nearest 50 as appropriate.</P>

        <P>I assume that what the Deputy requires is the number of PAYE and self employed income earners on the income tax record for each of the past five years over a range of income categories. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following tables.</P>
        <P>For the tax years 2000-01 and 2001, the numbers of income earners at all income levels in the tables are best estimates based on data from completed end of year returns but adjusted to take account of returns which had not been received when the data were compiled. For later years, the numbers of earners in the various ranges of income are based on the adjusted data for 2001 projected forward in accordance with macroeconomic data relating to actual and expected growth in wages and employment.</P><Col N="1255"/>

          <i>Notes:</i>
        </P>
        <P>It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above tables relate to gross income. Gross income is income which: is prior to deductions for capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities, etc.; is after deduction of superannuation contributions by employees but not by the self employed; includes income of individuals whose total income falls below the exemption limits; does not include certain other income which is not income for tax purposes or is exempt from tax, such as profits or gains from stallion fees, profits from commercial forestry and certain income from patent royalties, certain investment income arising from personal injuries, child benefit, maternity benefit and unemployment assistance paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, certain earnings of writers, composers and artists, bonus or interest paid under instalment savings schemes operated by An Post, interest on certain Government securities, certain foreign pensions which are exempt from tax in the foreign paying country, portion of certain lump sums received by employees on cessation of their employment, statutory redundancy payments and certain military pensions; and does not include or not fully include other income sources such as interest income that does not need to be declared or is not recorded but from which tax has been deducted, unemployment benefit and disability benefit &mdash; non-recording of non-taxable amounts and of amounts taxed by restriction of repayments or indirectly through employers in the PAYE system, and the incomes of certain self employed persons, including some farmers, as well as some individuals in receipt of pensions, who are not processed annually on tax records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.</P>
        <P>A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The figures for the years, 2001, 2002 and 2003 have been revised from those quoted in the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question of 27 November 2003, D&aacute;il Debates, Vol. 575, No. 5, Cols. 1153-1154, to take account of more up to date base information and revised macro-economic projections of income levels and number at work which have become available.

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that reducing the top rate of income tax by one percentage point and two percentage points would cost the Exchequer an estimated &euro;190 million and &euro;380 million respectively, in a full year, based on projected 2005 incomes.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, under the stamp duty code, stamp duty arises on instruments which convey, transfer or lease property, for example, houses and land. Whether that is done on foot of a planning condition has no relevance. However, there is provision in the stamp duty code for an exemption from stamp duty where property is conveyed, transferred or leased for charitable purposes to a body of persons established solely for such purposes.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
        <P>The amount of duty to be paid depends on the consideration paid for the property and on whether the property is residential or non-residential. A transfer by way of gift is chargeable as if it were a transfer for consideration, with the <Col N="1263"/>substitution of the market value of the property for the consideration. The person liable to pay the duty is normally the person to whom the property is conveyed, transferred, or leased.</P>
        <P>The person or persons liable to pay stamp duty to the Revenue Commissioners must do so not later than 30 days after the date of execution of the instrument concerned. If that is not done, penalties can arise. If the Deputy requires any further clarification of the issues raised, he should contact the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that the persons mentioned by the Deputy are treated as a married couple for tax purposes. They are receiving tax credits under joint assessment and these credits have been reduced to collect tax due on one of the spouse&rsquo;s social welfare income. The taxpayers were not granted the correct tax credits due or standard-rate cut-off point for the current year. An amended certificate will issue shortly incorporating the increased credits and cut-off point. The credits have been increased from &euro;2,660 to &euro;3,790 and the cut-off point from &euro;29,896 to &euro;37,000. The certificate is effective from 1 January 2004.

	<P>In July 2002 the Government issued its debt relief strategy Policy on Developing Country Debt, which was prepared jointly by my Department and Ireland Aid, now called Development Co-operation Ireland. This forms the basis of our policy on the total cancellation of the debt of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. The Government has advocated this policy on debt relief in discussions, both at political and senior official level, with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, Ministers from heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, a number of our EU partners and in other fora.</P>
        <P>While the Government advocates debt cancellation, it does so in the context of the availability of resources and the competing claims on the resources available to the international financial institutions. Total cancellation would have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. To mobilise such necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their overseas development aid, ODA, more rapidly.</P>
        <P>In the spring 2004 meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, my predecessor acting as chairman of the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, urged all creditors and donors, who had not yet done so, to provide their share of bilateral debt relief and multilateral financing to the HIPC initiative. My Department, in close co-ordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works commissioned consultants in 2002 to carry out feasibility studies to assess flood risk and to develop flood alleviation schemes in the towns of Mallow and Fermoy in County Cork. Engineering reports were completed in late 2003 for both areas. Following consideration of the completed reports, the consultants on each scheme were asked to investigate the possibility of phasing the proposed works. Phasing reports were completed on both schemes and public information days were held in spring 2004 in both towns, which outlined the proposed works and the phased methods of implementation.</P>
        <P>The proposed scheme in Mallow includes the construction of new walls and embankments, new culverts, lowering of ground levels around Mallow Bridge, and some use of demountable structures. The scheme will have flood protection against a one in a hundred flood. Phase one of the scheme, involving the construction of new culverts, which will be funded by the Office of Public Works and executed by the local authority, is on public exhibition. Subject to a successful exhibition, it is expected to commence construction works in March 2005. The full scheme will go on formal public exhibition in spring 2005, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts.</P>
        <P>The proposed scheme in Fermoy involves the construction of permanent walls and embankments along with the use of extensive demountable structures. The scheme will have flood protection against a one-in-a-hundred year flood. Before the Fermoy scheme is built it is essential to have an effective flood warning system in operation and the Office of Public Works has commenced this development as part of phase one of the scheme. The formal public exhibition of the scheme, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts, will take place early in 2005. The timetable for completing all phases of these schemes will depend on the availability of funds and prioritisation of the large number of schemes that are required in various locations.</P>

	<P>In accordance with EU legislation, EU and non-EU citizens travelling from states outside the European Union to Ireland are allowed to bring with them goods bought by themselves, either duty-free/tax-free or duty-paid/tax-paid, as follows: tobacco products &mdash; 200 cigarettes or 100 cigarillos or 50 cigars or 250 grammes of smoking tobacco; alcohol and alcoholic beverages &mdash; one litre of spirits such as whiskey, gin, vodka, or two litres of intermediate products not exceeding 22% volume such as port, sherry, sparkling wine etc. and two litres of still wine; and perfumes and toilet waters &mdash; 50 grammes of perfumes and 0.25 litres of toilet water.</P>
        <P>Apart from these, travellers also are entitled to an allowance for other goods to a value not exceeding &euro;175 per adult or &euro;90 per person under the age of 15 years. Presents or gifts sent by a private individual in a state outside the European Union to a private individual in Ireland for personal or family use are also subject to EU legislation. The position is that such gifts, other than tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and perfumes or toilet waters, up to a total value not exceeding &euro;45, may be imported without payment of customs duties including value added tax. Where the aggregate value exceeds &euro;45, duties are payable on the excess. There is no relief from value added tax or excise duty for <Col N="1268"/>tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and perfumes or toilet waters. However, subject to the overall value limit of &euro;45, relief from customs duties only is allowed on goods up to the following limits: tobacco products &mdash; 50 cigarettes or 25 cigarillos or 10 cigars or 50 grammes of smoking tobacco; alcohol and alcoholic beverages &mdash; one litre of spirits, such as whiskey, gin, vodka etc. or one litre of intermediate products not exceeding 22% volume, for example, port, sherry, sparkling wine etc. and two litres of still wine; and perfumes and toilet waters &mdash; 50 grammes of perfumes or 0.25 litres of toilet water.</P>
        <P>To avail of these provisions, parcels sent by post should be clearly marked as gifts on the customs declaration form. Presents sent other than by post should be declared as gifts to customs at importation.</P>

	<P>The Government decided to cap public service numbers at the number authorised in December 2002 and to reduce those numbers by 5,000 over the following three years. The timing and location of 4,300 of this reduction across sectors was decided by Government in July 2003. Civil Service numbers will be reduced by an aggregate of <Col N="1269"/>1,000 with the Office of Public Works making a proportionate contribution. The ongoing operational needs of the Office of Public Works are kept under constant review and appropriate categories of staff are recruited, as needed, within the parameters of Government policy on budgets and on Civil Service numbers.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 34 on Thursday 21 October 2004. Regarding the correspondence in question, I understand that Screen Producers Ireland has written to Members enclosing a copy of the report it commissioned on TG4. Screen Producers Ireland is the association that represents independent producers. The letter from Screen Producers Ireland requests that the grant-in-aid to TG4 should be increased in 2005.</P>
        <P>TG4 commissions the majority of its Irish language programming from the independent production sector. It is not surprising, therefore, that this sector is arguing for more public funds for TG4 as most of any additional funding would in turn be channelled to the independent production companies that Screen Producers Ireland represents. The funding of TG4 will be addressed, in the normal way, as part of the Estimates process.</P>

	<P>The vehicle for funding marine access infrastructure for tourism purposes was the marine tourism grant scheme, a sub-measure of the tourism measure under the national development plan. Funding for marina developments at Westport, Blacksod and Ballina was applied for by Mayo County Council and the respective harbour authorities under the scheme. Unfortunately, this scheme was suspended in December 2002 due to lack of available Exchequer funds and it is unlikely that it will be reactivated within the term of the national development plan.</P>
        <P>In February 2002 the Department did, however, provide funding of &euro;25,500 to Mayo County Council acting in partnership with Westport Harbour Commissioners towards a completed feasibility study for the development of a <Col N="1270"/>marina at Westport Harbour. While no funding is available specifically for marina developments, a payment of &euro;94,276 was made to Westport Harbour Commissioners in December 2002 for expenditure incurred on Westport harbours integrated development plan. This payment was made on the strict condition that there could be no expectation of further funding for the development plan under the seaports measure of the national development plan. In 2004 the Department provided the River Moy Harbour Commissioners with &euro;75,000 and the Westport Harbour Commissioners with &euro;180,000, for works aimed at protecting the safety of the public and the fabric of the harbours.</P>

	<P>Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 the functions of sea-fishing boat licensing and registration were transferred from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act. All applications are therefore considered by the licensing authority. The registrar general of fishing boats is the head of the authority, a senior official in my Department.</P>
        <P>The authority has informed me that it is processing to finality the licence application for the vessel in question. It has written to the previous owners of the boat requesting that they officially remove the vessel from the fishing boat register. This is required to enable registration of the vessel by the current owner. A non-operative licence to facilitate such registration will issue as soon as this matter has been finalised. Upon registration of the vessel in the current owner&rsquo;s name an operative sea-fishing boat licence will be issued by the licensing authority.</P>

        <P>The licensing authority informs me that it has been unable to complete the processing of this and other licence applications for the aquaculture fleet segment in the absence of an assessment by appropriate expertise of aquaculture plans submitted with the applications. Approval of an aquaculture plan is currently a prerequisite for the issuing of a letter of licence offer for the aquaculture segment. The licensing authority considers that the methodology used for assessing licence applications for this fleet segment requires to be reviewed and, to this end, is pursuing the matter with relevant divisions within my Department. It is hoped that this issue will be shortly resolved so that the licensing authority can issue substantive replies to outstanding licence applications for the aquaculture segment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
        <P>Declarations to EU treaties are statements of the political intent of those making the declaration. While they have political weight and can be taken into account in the interpretation of a treaty, they are not in themselves legally binding. There is, therefore, no formal procedure for their amendment, but they can be effectively replaced or altered by subsequent developments.</P>
        <P>As regards the question of the qualified majority voting threshold in a Union of 27 members, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the situation remains as set out in my predecessor&rsquo;s letter of September 2002 to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The discrepancy between the figures given in two declarations to the Treaty of Nice was effectively resolved before signature of that treaty in February 2001. The operative figure for the period between the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is likely to take place in 2007, and the planned entry into effect on 1 November 2009 of the new voting system provided for in the European Constitution, is to be 255 votes out of a total of 345. This will be legally provided for in the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which will be prepared for signature following the successful conclusion of negotiations with them.</P>

	<P>The local authority swimming pool programme administered by my Department provides grant aid towards either the capital costs of new pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. The closing date for receipt of applications from local authorities under the current programme was 31 July 2000.</P>
        <P>Overall, there are 55 projects in the programme. Of these, 14 swimming pool projects have been opened or have completed construction work. These are in Arklow, Courtown in Gorey, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Wicklow, Roscommon, the Aquadome in Tralee, Ballinasloe, Finglas in Dublin, Grove Island in Limerick and the Regional Sports and Leisure Centre in Tralee. Eight projects are at construction phase in Clonmel, Tuam, Churchfield in Cork City, Cobh, Youghal, Ballymun and Ballyfermot in Dublin, and Drogheda. In addition, 33 other applications are at various stages in the process, five are at tender stage, 13 at contract document stage and 15 at preliminary report stage. This includes those waiting on feasibility report approval. These 33 applications are for pool projects in Letterkenny, Jobstown and Clondalkin in South County Dublin, Monaghan Town, Killarney, Ballybunion, Naas, Athy, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Dunmanway, Askeaton, Thurles, Roscrea, Longford, Glenalbyn and Dundrum in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Skerries in Fingal, Tullamore, Edenderry, Clara, Birr, Claremorris, Castlebar, New Ross, Bray, Greystones, Kilkenny City, Ballaghadereen, Ballybofey, Buncrana, Loughrea and Ferrybank, in Wexford.</P>
        <P>As there are many complex technical aspects involved in refurbishing, replacing or constructing a swimming pool on a greenfield site, the process from feasibility study to the completion of the project can take some years. A great amount of technical work by the local authorities is involved together with approval by my Department, supported by the Office of Public Works, at each stage of the development process. New pool proposals are expected to include attractive additional features such as saunas, steam room and toddler pools, thus providing better long-term value for money, including increasing potential for self-financing in operating costs, and greater benefit to local communities. The average cost of a standard pool facility, exclusive of gym or fitness facilities, has increased and the finalisation of the financial passage by local authorities, <Col N="1277"/>which are required to meet the balance of the cost of its project over my Department&rsquo;s grant of &euro;3.8 million for a new pool, can contribute to some delay. There is also a recent and marked trend towards enhanced fitness and other sports facilities attached or adjacent to pools, with consequent implications for overall project costs.</P>
        <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is also administered by my Department, provides grant aid for the development of a sports and recreational sport facilities and is the primary means of developing the sporting infrastructure of the country. Applications under the sports capital programme are accepted from voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies of sport, schools, colleges and local authorities. Over 10,500 applications have been received and 4,271 grants allocated under the programme since 1998. Projects grant-aided can include such facilities as natural and artificial playing surfaces, dressing room and showers, <Col N="1278"/>floodlighting, sports halls and sporting equipment. Applicants may also apply for funding for the so-called &ldquo;dry&rdquo; facilities which complement those available at swimming pools.</P>
        <P>A key requirement of any project funded under the sport capital programme is that it provides for sporting activity. The loose definition of leisure centre is not used within my Department to categorise sports capital projects. Under the programme grants have been awarded to municipal or multi-sport projects, which refer to centres covering several different sporting activities usually administered and-or managed by local authorities or community organisations. Under the 2004 sports capital programme, a total of 1,304 applications were submitted from which 738 projects were provisionally allocated &euro;61 million in funding. A total of 23 applications were in the category of municipal or multi-sport, of which 16 were provisionally allocated &euro;8,210,000 in funding. These were as follows:</P><Col N="1277"/>

        <P FLI="0">The sports capital programme is advertised annually and applications submitted are assessed and then a decision is made on whether they are successful within the cycle of that year&rsquo;s programme. Under the 2004 programme, for example, the closing date for receipt of applications was 16 January 2004. The 1,304 applications received were assessed in accordance with detailed criteria as published in the detailed guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme which were issued with the application forms for the programme. On 7 May and 10 August last, I announced provisional grant allocations under the programme and the successful applicants were informed of the various requirements which must be met before funding can be drawn down. I will make an announcement shortly about the timetable for submission of applications for grants under the 2005 sports capital programme.</P>

	<P>My Department has not sought any expressions of interest in the metro. Statutory responsibility in that regard rests with the Railway Procurement Agency which in May 2002 launched a pre-qualification exercise, the purpose of which was to assess the experience and capacity of potential bidders for the metro project. The qualification system is open for three years. Of the 34 candidates who submitted requests for qualification, 18 have been qualified in all disciplines in which they sought qualification. These candidates are listed in the table:</P><Col N="1281"/>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 farming early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. My Department&rsquo;s proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period between 2000 and 2006, make provision for annual increases in pensions over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead. The EU regulations governing the schemes of early retirement from farming require that any national retirement pension, contributory or non-contributory, to which a scheme participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management situation, becomes entitled must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question raises two issues, the first of which relates to the use of fireworks. As he is aware, fireworks are deemed <Col N="1289"/>to be explosives under the provisions of the Explosives Act 1875. They may be imported into the State only under an importation licence granted by my Department. It is a long-standing policy that licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators and in accordance with agreed safety procedures. I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the dangers posed by the use of illegal fireworks and of the distress they cause to people, particularly at this time of year.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that the Garda puts special operations in place each year to address the problem in the run-up to and during the Hallowe'en season. Information is gathered and appropriate follow-up action is taken by the Garda, aimed at the seizure of illicit fireworks and involving close liaison with local authorities. Each year, the Garda authorities seize a substantial amount of fireworks, which are subsequently destroyed. Over the past two months the Garda has had significant success in confiscating fireworks. For example, a large cache of fireworks, estimated to be valued at &euro;100,000, was seized at Dundalk. In order to strengthen the powers of the Garda in tackling this matter I have instructed officials in my Department to prepare legislative proposals to increase significantly the penalties under the Explosives Act 1875 for illegal importation, public sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <P>The second issue raised by the Deputy was drug abuse. I am sure he agrees that the social consequences of drug abuse are significantly greater than those of illegal fireworks. The Garda and the Customs and Excise work in close co-operation on the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of illegal drugs being smuggled into the State. They have achieved considerable successes, such as drug seizures.</P>
        <P>Two high level seminars on cross-Border organised crime have been organised by my Department and the Northern Ireland Office over the last 18 months, with the involvement of senior representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. During the most recent seminar in September, the first joint threat assessment of cross-Border organised crime was launched and work was commenced on developing joint operational and tactical responses to the risks identified. The threat assessment document states that investigations into a number of drugs operations have led to a number of notable arrests and seizures on both sides of the Border.</P>

	<P>The Disability Bill is a key element of the national disability strategy, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 21 September 2004. The launch involved the seven Ministers with direct responsibility for the various elements of the strategy. There are four elements to the strategy &mdash; the Disability Bill 2004, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, the six outline sectoral plans and a commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability support services which will be announced as part of the Estimates and budget process. My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who was then responsible as Minister of State for disability and equality, addressed the launch on the content of the Disability Bill and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill. He outlined the role of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in overseeing the preparation of the Bill and other elements of the strategy. He acknowledged the contribution of the disability legislation consultation group to the consultation process on the Bill.</P>

I have been advised that the system continues to operate successfully in these locations. It is planned to commence the rollout of the system to the entire Dublin metropolitan area at the end of November 2004. Thereafter, nationwide rollout of the system depends on the enactment of the Road Traffic Bill 2004, which will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the collection of payments by a service provider. I assure the Deputy that the system will be rolled out nationwide as quickly as possible after the enactment of the requisite legislation.</P>

	<P>A working group on safety cameras chaired by my Department and consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority is examining the provision, operation and processing of the output of speed cameras. Work is well advanced on preparing proposals on how the management of the speed cameras will be structured with a view to issuing a request for tenders in the near future. The private operator, or operators, will provide, operate and process the output of the cameras. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will manage the project.</P>

        <P>Regarding the Criminal Assets Bureau, the powers of the bureau will be further bolstered with additional measures in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill now before the Seanad. The Bill will make certain technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, and in particular will remove any doubt that there may be over when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for the purposes of that Act.</P><Col N="1292"/>
        <P>Other relevant legislative initiatives are planned in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill. The first of those is provided for in Part 3 of the Bill. Those provisions will allow the courts to admit in certain specified circumstances previous witness statements where a witness recants or refuses to testify at trial. Given that such refusal to co-operate may arise from intimidation, the provision is designed to ensure that witness statements might still be available to the courts even though the witness subsequently refuses to co-operate. The second initiative, which I will propose by way of an amendment to the Bill, is to make it an offence to participate in or contribute to the activities of a criminal organisation.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to my responses to Question No. 250 of 13 December 2001 and Question No. 155 of 29 January 2004, wherein I indicated that <Col N="1293"/>the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged to consider the issue of risk to a person before, not after, a deportation order is issued in respect of that person.</P>
        <P>There are legislative and procedural safeguards to ensure that persons are not returned to countries where they would be at risk. The issue of <i>refoulement</i>, as set out in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, is given full consideration in every case before a deportation order is made. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. That means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>

Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the service to decide how the funding provided is specifically allocated.

	<P>Temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems world-wide, and parole is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way. <Col N="1294"/>While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned reintegration of offenders were not made, since they must return to the community anyway on the completion of their sentence.</P>
        <P>Prisoners are considered for temporary release in certain circumstances, for example, release under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service, to employment or training programmes, on compassionate release because of ill health or family-related circumstances, or for reintegration purposes because they are nearing the end of their sentence. Figures for 1 November 2004 indicate that there were 299 persons on temporary release, a number which represents about 8% of the total prison population. That compares with figures in the region of 550 persons on temporary release &mdash; about 20% of the prison population &mdash; in the mid 1990s.</P>

Ahern.</P>
        <P>The current national strategy sets out a framework for action for the period 2001-08. With the launch of this strategy all the elements of drugs policy were brought together in a single framework for the first time. Drugs policy is being delivered across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
        <P>Within this framework, my Department will continue to develop measures, in consultation with the relevant Departments, agencies and the community and voluntary sector to ensure that a co-ordinated and integrated response is in place to tackle the drugs problem. Moreover, a steering group under the aegis of the lead Department is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the national drugs strategy. This review, in addition to examining progress to date in implementing the goals and actions set out in the strategy, will focus on identifying priorities for future action and enable a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary, for the remaining period up to 2008.

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that it is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division. The personnel strength of the Carlow-Kildare division as at 1 of November 2004 was 324, all ranks. This represents an increase of 32 or 11% over the personnel strength of the division as at <Col N="1296"/>1 of January 1998 which stood at 292, all ranks, at that time. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in Carlow-Kildare with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review by Garda management and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of Kildare will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, I am pleased to say that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing and will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>I understand from the Garda authorities that there is a history of anti-social behaviour in the church grounds in question. I am informed that incidents of anti-social behaviour have been greatly reduced as a result of consultations between local Garda management, the divisional crime prevention officer and the local clergy on problem issues in the church grounds and on measures to counteract and reduce these issues. Regular patrolling by Garda mobile and foot patrols which cover the church grounds in question has also contributed to the reduction in the anti-social behaviour. I am further informed <Col N="1298"/>that the erection of a new perimeter fence, along with the redesign of the car park following consultation with the crime prevention officer has also contributed to this reduction in anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Cabra Garda station, as at 29 October 2004, was 64, all ranks.

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that during September 2004 a number of complaints were received from local residents regarding anti-social behaviour by groups of youths. In response, local Garda management carried out a covert operation, over a number of days, with a view to targeting the individuals involved. As a result, seven youths were stopped, searched and moved on. Eleven youths found drinking were cautioned by garda&iacute; and brought home to their parents. One adult who is alleged to have purchased the alcohol will be subject to criminal proceedings. I understand that there has been one arrest for public order and one arrest for criminal damage in the area. Garda authorities have informed me that, since this operation, there have been no recorded incidents of anti-social behaviour and vandalism.</P>
        <P>Two garda&iacute; are specifically allocated to the area which receives regular patrol from both mobile and foot patrols, and this will continue. Local management also met representatives of three local residents groups on 18 October 2004, who conveyed their appreciation for the Garda action and stated that they had noted the increased Garda presence. An initiative to incorporate the area into a neighbourhood watch scheme is under way.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength, as at 29 October 2004, of Cabra Garda station was 64, all ranks, the strength of Mountjoy Garda station was 88, all ranks, and the strength at Bridewell <Col N="1299"/>Garda station was 164, all ranks. For security and operational reasons, it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of personnel working in any particular area at any given time.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which he arrives at the decision regarding whether a work permit holder is in a position to fully support their spouse and family for the purpose of granting reunification visas to family members; and the weekly or monthly income a work permit holder must earn to be considered able to fully support their family.</Quest>

	<P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for policy in respect of family reunion, that is, the policy in connection with granting permission to enter and remain in the State to the spouses and children of non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in the State. This includes the spouses and dependent children of non-EEA nationals who have entered the State for work purposes. I fully acknowledge that family reunion policy should recognise the needs of persons coming to Ireland to work and be in accordance with the broad needs of Irish economy, including the safeguarding of public resources.</P>
        <P>In the case of a visa required by family members of non-EEA national workers, the general rule is that it is only after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered employment for a further 12 months that they may be joined by their families. This is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds. There is no general time restriction in operation in respect of family reunion where the family members in question are not visa required. Again, the only caveat is that the worker in question must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds.</P>
        <P>When assessing applications for family reunification, the visa officer will consider, among other things, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payments from public funds. In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement, FIS, are used. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available<?oasys _jy?>on that Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.welfare.ie/<?oasys _jy?><Col N="1300"/>publications/sw22.html</i>. If the level of the worker&rsquo;s income, as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60, would qualify for FIS payments, the application for family reunification is generally refused as it is evident that the family can seek recourse to public funds.</P>

	<P>The visa application in question was to enable the wife of a non-EEA national employed under the work permit scheme to reside with him in the State. A worker employed under the work permit scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. The application in question was refused as the supporting documentation did not show that the worker in question was in a position to fully support his wife. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department received visa applications from the three persons in question on 23 June 2004. The applicants stated that they wished to visit another non-EEA national who is working in the State under the work permit scheme. The applicants did not specify the dates they intended to travel, nor the duration of their proposed visit on their visa application forms.</P>
        <P>In assessing any visa application the visa officer will consider various matters. These include whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant&rsquo;s stated purpose of visit is the true purpose of visit and that the appli<Col N="1301"/>cant will fully honour the conditions of the visa &mdash; for example, is he or she unlikely to overstay the length of time applied for or to work without a work permit? The visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of remaining in the State. Credibility is central to the visa determination process. Not surprisingly, inconsistencies or omissions on the face of an application can cause the visa officer to conclude that it is not reasonable in the circumstances to grant a visa. The Department&rsquo;s approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. Common examples of previous abuse include individuals who although granted a visa to come on short visits overstayed with a view to establishing themselves permanently in the State, and groups of persons who avail of organised events for the purpose of gaining entry to the State for other purposes.</P>
        <P>The applications in question were refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed evidence of their obligations to return home following their proposed visit. An appeal was made against the decisions. The visa appeals officer, having re-examined the applications, upheld the original decisions. It is open to the applicants to make fresh applications and the matter will be considered anew.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy at 30 September 2003 was 369 pupils, <Col N="1305"/>which warrants a staffing of principal plus 13 mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year. The school also has a learning support post. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The staffing schedule for the current school year is structured to ensure all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils.</P>
        <P>School authorities should ensure there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum. I am committed to reducing class sizes further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis and priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes. I have requested my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate to monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes and, where necessary, to discuss with school authorities the basis on which school policy decisions in this regard have been made and to report to my Department, where appropriate.</P>

	<P>The main capitation-based grants at primary level are the capitation grant itself and the ancillary services (caretakers-secretaries) grant. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools is currently &euro;121.58 per pupil, subject to a minimum grant for small schools with 60 or less pupils of &euro;7,295. Enhanced capitation grants, ranging from &euro;276 per pupil to &euro;599.50 per pupil, are payable in respect of pupils enrolled in special classes in primary schools.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant, which goes towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking facilities in primary schools, is currently &euro;127 per pupil, subject to a minimum grant of &euro;6,350 paid to schools with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of &euro;63,500 paid to schools with 500 pupils or more. The new grants scheme for minor works to national school properties commenced in 1997. Payment under the scheme to each primary school per academic year consisted of a basic grant of £2,000 or &euro;2,539.48 plus £9 or &euro;11.43 per pupil. The payment rates were increased in 2000 to £3,000 or &euro;3,809.21 in respect of the basic grant and to £10 or &euro;12.70 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Under the various disadvantage programmes administered by my Department&rsquo;s social inclusion unit, a number of grants are capitation-based. Under the Giving Children an Even Break programme, a special <i>per capita</i> grant is paid in respect of the percentage of pupils with disadvantaged characteristics. This grant is &euro;63.49 per pupil and participating schools receive a minimum payment of &euro;952.30. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme schools receive a capitation supplement of &euro;38.09 per pupil. Under the urban phase of Breaking the Cycle, 32 schools receive annual grant assistance in addition to the above of &euro;5,078.95 for out of school projects aimed at combating disadvantage and &euro;3,809.21 in respect of materials and equipment. Under the rural phase of BTC, 120 schools receive annual grants of &euro;1,269.74 for materials and equipment and &euro;1,269.74 for out of school projects.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Early Start pre-school project, an annual capitation grant of &euro;95.23 per <Col N="1307"/>pupil is paid to the school&rsquo;s board of management to be used as funding support for day to day running costs of the centre. This capitation payment is based on current year enrolments. The standard <i>per capita</i> rate amounts to &euro;274 in secondary schools. An additional <i>per capita</i> rate of &euro;38 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the <i>per capita</i> grant in such schools to &euro;312 per pupil. In addition, secondary schools also receive the school services support grant that stands at &euro;131 per pupil. Schools where instruction is in full or in part through the medium of Irish qualify for an extra <i>per capita</i> grant of up to &euro;86.85 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Schools are also eligible for additional recurrent grants towards classes for pupils with special needs amounting to &euro;200.62 per pupil and &euro;427 per Traveller child and curricular support grants viz., transition year, &euro;63.49; leaving certificate applied, &euro;158.7; special subjects grant, &euro;1.90 at junior certificate level and &euro;3.81 per senior cycle student; science initiative, &euro;12.70, and the introductory<i> per capita </i>grant for the junior certificate schools programme, &euro;63.49. Schools are also eligible for support under the following programmes: the special needs equipment grants to enable students with a disability to participate in mainstream second level education; school administration ICT funding; the ICT school initiative and the grant scheme for school books for needy pupils.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department to provide for the delivery of a broad and balanced physical education curriculum at both primary and post primary levels. With regard to facilities generally, many schools have general purposes rooms or physical education halls and practically all schools have outdoor play areas that are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. Many schools also use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
        <P>The provision of general purposes rooms and multi-purpose spaces for primary schools is considered within the design brief for new schools and-or renovation-extension school building projects.

        <P>Information has not been compiled on the number of schools that do not have a principal&rsquo;s office, as available funding is targeted at improving conditions in schools on the basis of the published criteria for prioritising school building projects rather than directing expenditure to the compilation of an inventory of existing accommodation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s proposed automatic mechanism for allocating resource teachers to primary schools is intended to cater for pupils requiring learning support and those with higher incidence special educational needs. An additional 350 teaching posts are being allocated to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The proposed system is intended to improve and streamline the special education resource teacher allocation process. The model will obviate the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensure pupils in receipt of service continue to receive the level of support appropriate to their needs. In that context, the additional posts being put in place represent a significant investment to ensure the success of the measure.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in regard to the model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as proposed. Accordingly, I will review the proposal to ensure it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year. <Col N="1309"/>The question of further resource allocation can be considered in light of that assessment.</P>

	<P>The Phoenix Centre of Learning is one of three projects operated by the Line Projects and assisted by my Department. The Phoenix Centre of Learning has operated under a voluntary management committee for seven years and has provided an intervention learning facility for early school leavers. My Department has provided teaching and other financial support to the centre since 1997.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month, my Department was advised that the Phoenix centre had closed and I understand that the Line Projects board of management has no future plans to re-open the centre. I understand that there were some seven young people due to attend the centre from September. The National Educational Welfare Board is aware of and is pursuing alternative educational placements for the individuals concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposed new system for resource teacher allocation involves a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, and those with learning support needs, that is functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics.</P><Col N="1311"/>
        <P>The proposed allocation mechanism is as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, the ratio will be one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, the ratio will be one for every 200 pupils. In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.</P>
        <P>The rationale for a pupil teacher ratio of 150 pupils for every teacher in mixed schools to support pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and learning difficulties-delays is that the pupil teacher ratio for a learning support teacher was approximately 300 pupils; 10% of pupils would be expected to have learning difficulties in the fields of literacy and numeracy and, on that basis, approximately 15 out of a group of 150 pupils would be expected to have learning difficulties. This is considered half of a teacher&rsquo;s caseload. A further 3%, or four or five pupils, in this cohort would be expected to have higher-incidence special educational needs and would expect to receive 2.5 resource teaching hours per week. This would account for the other half of a teacher&rsquo;s caseload.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the different pupil teacher ratios in boys&rsquo;&mdash; 140:1 &mdash; and girls&rsquo;&mdash; 200:1 &mdash; schools is twofold: international literature on the incidence of disability indicates that, across all disability types, there is a greater incidence in boys than in girls; and international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy have found that these difficulties are more common among boys than girls. The rationale for the level of support proposed for schools in areas of urban disadvantage is that evidence shows that there is a significantly higher incidence of literacy and numeracy difficulties in urban disadvantaged compared to other schools, including those in areas of rural disadvantage. It is important to emphasise that applications may be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs regardless of gender of pupil or status of school. I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the revised model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. The proposed system is intended to improve and streamline the special education resource teacher allocation process. The model will obviate the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensure that <Col N="1312"/>pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of support appropriate to their needs. In that context, the additional posts being put in place represent a very significant investment to ensure the success of the measure.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I will be reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year.</P>

	<P>Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department&rsquo;s approach is now refined to ensure that individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, under this scheme my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Primary schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department.</P>
        <P>Resources are allocated to schools on a sliding scale and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are allocated proportionally more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils. Every participating school is entitled to a special &euro;63.49 <i>per <Col N="1313"/>capita </i>grant in respect of the percentage of pupils with disadvantaged characteristics and schools receive a minimum of &euro;952.30 per annum.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break. The school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. My Department is currently examining an application from the school for increased resource teaching support for Traveller children and contact will be made with the school authorities when this process is complete.</P>

	<P>In addition to providing accommodation for Travellers in standard social housing, under their five-year Traveller accommodation programmes, local authorities provide accommodation for Travellers in Traveller specific accommodation such as group houses and halting site bays. Local authorities also refurbish existing Traveller specific accommodation to modern standards.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the number of permanent halting site bays provided in the period 2001-03. In addition to this, a further 106 new emergency-temporary bays were provided for Travellers awaiting permanent accommodation, 130 permanent halting site bays were refurbished, as were 11 emergency-temporary bays.</P><Col N="1317"/>
        <P>Between 2001 and 2003, two local authorities provided transient facilities for Travellers. Donegal County Council provided 20 units and Westmeath County Council provided 12 units, while a number of other local authorities have indicated that some of the bays in their permanent halting sites are used as transient bays from time to time.</P>

        <Quest>the number of applications for funding received in his Department by local authorities seeking to provide halting or transient sites in their areas; the number of local authorities that have halting sites; if the number of sites are compatible with the needs of the local authority; the funding available from his Department in regard to the provision of such sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, all relevant local authorities adopted five-year Traveller accommodation programmes covering the period 2000 to 2004. The provision, under these programmes, of new Traveller specific accommodation and the refurbishment of existing Traveller specific accommodation, which includes halting sites and group houses, is funded under my Department&rsquo;s Traveller accommodation capital programme, for which &euro;40 million was allocated in 2004.</P>
        <P>In addition to funding for schemes under construction or schemes completed with outstanding balances, there are 11 applications for funding to commence permanent halting sites schemes being considered by my Department. There are currently no applications for funding for transient sites before my Department.</P>
        <P>As required under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, each county and city <Col N="1318"/>council, borough council and the town councils of Bray and Dundalk have prepared and adopted five-year Traveller accommodation programmes covering the period 2000 to 2004. Of the 38 local authorities that undertook a Traveller accommodation programme, 36 have permanent halting sites in their functional areas. Louth County Council and Wexford Borough Council do not have permanent halting sites in their functional areas; however, Traveller families are accommodated on permanent halting sites in Drogheda Borough Council and Dundalk Town Council, in the case of Louth County Council, and Wexford County Council in the case of Wexford Borough Council.</P>
        <P>Local authorities provide Traveller accommodation in accordance with their five-year Traveller accommodation programmes, which are based on a prior assessment of need. This assessment takes into account both current and future need having regard to new family formations. While local authorities are not in a position, in all cases, to make precise assessments of the category of accommodation required, programmes generally allow for further consideration of new identified needs for Traveller accommodation over the course of the programmes.</P>

        <Quest>the total funding provided by his Department in regard to the provision of central heating in local authority schemes; the number of applications received for such grants in each local authority area for each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department introduced a programme in July 2004 for the installation of central heating in existing local authority rented dwellings. A sum of &euro;12 million has been provided by my Department for the programme in 2004, and this has been allocated in response to applications from 69 local authorities.</P>
        <P>Prior to this initiative, my Department has required, since 1994, that central heating be provided during construction in new local authority dwellings and included in the overall cost of schemes. Where capital funding is provided under regeneration and remedial programmes operated by my Department for upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken.</P>
        <P>More generally, the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is, in general, the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources. The present initiative is an important enhancement of <Col N="1319"/>local authorities&rsquo; own measures and will lead to the continued upgrading of the local authority housing stock.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the number of applications for funding for disabled persons grants and essential repairs grants received by Kildare County Council in each of the past three years; the funding granted by his Department to the council for each of these years; the percentage of the total cost that this amounted to; if the local authority made applications for further funding to offset the number of applications refused in 2004 by the local authority; if funding is available from his Department to local authorities at this stage to overcome the funding problems related to the grant scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The available information on the number of disabled persons and essential repairs grant applications received by each local authority is published in my Department&rsquo;s annual housing statistics bulletin. Copies of the bulletin are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>For the years 2001 and 2002, the capital allocations made to Kildare County Council were &euro;1,269,738 and &euro;1 million, respectively. These represented the combined allocations for house purchase and improvement loans and the disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes. The capital allocation for 2003 was &euro;1,642,000 and represented the combined allocation for the disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes only, which signified a substantial increase in funding.</P>
        <P>My Department recoups to authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</P>
        <P>Allocations are made on the basis of demands made by each local authority and the amount of funding available to the Department. It is a matter for the local authority to manage the operation of the scheme in their areas from within these allocations, to provide for their one third contribution and to approach the Department for additional funding, if required.</P>
        <P>With regard to 2004, Kildare County Council received a capital allocation of &euro;934,000 in May. It subsequently sought an increase of &euro;116,000, which was allocated to it on 9 September, to bring its total allocation for the payment of disabled <Col N="1320"/>persons and essential repairs grants in 2004 to &euro;1,050,000. No further requests for increased funding have been received from the council in respect of these schemes.</P>
        <P>Additional funding is available and if Kildare County Council applies, consideration will be given to its application in the context of overall demands. However, while it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by the authority without a corresponding revision of the authority&rsquo;s own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</P>

	<P>Under the affordable housing scheme, launched in March 1999, a mortgage subsidy is payable to qualifying households based on income bands. A similar subsidy applies under the shared ownership scheme towards the rent payments for that portion of the equity not yet purchased. A total of &euro;2,038,876 was recouped by the Department to local authorities in respect of these subsidies in 2003, for claims relating to 1,630 people. There is also a mortgage allowance available to those vacating local authority dwellings but this is not based on incomes.</P><Col N="1322"/>
        <P>The number of persons who purchased houses under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes between 2000 and June 2004 was 9,085. Of these, 5,916 transactions were completed under the shared ownership scheme and 3,169 homes were purchased under the affordable housing scheme. Figures for the proportion of those who receive a subsidy as a percentage of those benefiting under the schemes are not available as some recipients may have bought out their shared ownership house and others may have moved outside of the income brackets.</P>
        <P>The qualifying income limits and the amounts of the rent and mortgage subsidies under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, respectively, were increased four years ago for all transactions completed on or after 15 June 2000. They are set as follows.</P>

        <P FLI="0">If the income limits were increased in line with the growth in the average industrial wage or the consumer price index since 2000, the maximum qualifying income would have risen from &euro;25,500 to about &euro;30,500 or &euro;28,900, respectively. A rise in the subsidy levels in line with the CPI would cost about &euro;275,000 per annum, but increasing the income limits would increase this substantially as additional people would qualify. Any consideration of improvements to the scheme would have to take account of the most effective use of resources to improve access to housing for low income families; it was against this background that the scheme was initially introduced.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, there have been significant improvements to the shared ownership scheme and the access to affordable housing has been significantly enhanced through increased output under the 1999 scheme and this will grow in future years as additional units come through under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2002 and the affordable housing initiative.</P>
        <P>I also announced increases in the income limits for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes and house purchase loans in July of this year, together with increases in the loan limits, in line with growth in average wage costs and house price inflation. These targeted measures are important mechanisms of providing access to affordable housing by low and modest income households by providing them with a house at a <Col N="1323"/>discounted price. With the increased availability of such housing, the funding of a loan becomes a less critical barrier to house purchase particularly with the growth in disposable incomes and historically low income rates.</P><Col N="1324"/>
        <P>Nonetheless, the terms and conditions of these schemes will continue to be kept under review and, in particular, the housing forum has been charged under Sustaining Progress to review the effectiveness of all social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
